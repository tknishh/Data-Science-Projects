# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a form of identity theft that involves an unauthorized taking of anotherâ€™s credit card information for the purpose of charging purchases to the account or removing funds from it.

In this project, we will develop a machine learning model using classification algorithms and techniques to accurately detect if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. We will also deploy our model as an API using FastAPI and create a frontend interface using Streamlit to access our API.
