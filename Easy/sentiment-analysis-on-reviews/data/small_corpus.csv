There is little to no re-playability, there is no variety, the side quests and events are not interesting at all. The itemization makes most of the gear useless and not even worth putting on AH. The storyline and dialogue are mediocre and resemble Saturday morning cartoons, although D3 is rated M. If you can't afford buying off of AH, you have to grind indefinitely to progress in inferno. Difficulty levels vs. classes are completely dis-balanced.

Diablo 3 sold over 6 mil at launch, the sales that are solely based on the promise and reputation of the past games. The game itself has little of anything positive to offer on its on.

The more a terrible company like EA focuses on micro transactions and HUT cards for profit, the worse the actual game play becomes. I know there's plenty of obsessed kids out there with mom's credit card on file buying the latest stick and what not, and that is what drives modern video game profits. I'm OK with that, if the game itself stays intact, which in this case it has been stripped.

EASHL was core aspect of this game for years. Take out all the glitch goals, cheating and poor connection issues, the game was fun. Now they have stripped out any creativity and customization available. Your player now levels up instead of earning points to add to your build. Wait...build. That's gone too. No longer can you tweak your player to your liking or play style. You must enter a match up and pick from a previous built default player. What ever the rationale behind this was it failed. Weather to make things ""fair"" or they simply focused on their HUT money machine I'm not sure.

Once you play the game itself, the real disappointment sets in. Skating is slow and sloppy. You feel like gravity is multiplied and you are stuck in one place. Shooting is weak as well as the hits. Quick moves with the right stick are also no longer. I feel like the game went back to NHL 94 and stayed there with better graphics.

The AI is abysmal as well. As usual however. This is something that has always been bad.

This game has had its ups and downs over the years for sure. However, the pay for ratings and marketing always ensure a big launch with crazy new features raved about by the ""trusted reviewers "". Ever wonder how a game that isn't even out yet is ""sports game of the year""? Or 10/10 by IGN? I'm sure 17 won't disappoint. I'm sure the game of the year posters are already printed.

Being a major fan of the series, this was a massive blow. Not to mention 1200 MSP for Lancer skins, 1200 MSP for Sniper skins, etc. etc. Thanks for the fan support EPIC. You just couldn't give us something for free, huh???

I just don't see how so many people are supporting this game. The thing that scares me is that it was just announced that there may be 3 more prequels to the Gears series. With the amount of fanboy praise GOW3 has received, EPIC will likely make 3 more of the same half-assed, low-budget games that are identical to this one.

I'm amazed that people are so in LOVE with the Gears franchise that they will dismiss this awful finish to the series. Luckily I have my head on straight and can see a lemon from a mile away.

That is, except for the fact that while the top screen has polished graphics, the bottom screen contains the silhouettes of the fruit and giant icon buttons that you're familiar with from something like Angry Birds.

On the system that it works on, I played through the single player and at first I was really disappointed, it got a little better in some missions but the whole campaign is disjointed and didn't flow at all. Most the time the enemies would popup and down like a duck hunt game. The final scene was good but the whole SP campaign was way too short.

Onto the multiplayer, could have been alright but most of the maps aren't that great, connectivity issues are huge and everyone I know can't get into a co-op match.

I ranked my way up and after a crash trying to quit the game I lost all my stats.

The sound is also messed up bad on Multiplayer (I have an XFI 7.1 sound card) you can't hear people around you and guns being shot 10 feet away sound like they are a mile away as do the grenades.

I have 2 9800's and the game won't run in SLI so my frame rates are 1/2 of what they should be.

Overall I wish I hadn't bought this game as it's like a beta that still needs fixing and for $50 + it shouldn't have all these problems.
I've been looking at other forums trying to fix all these issues and there are lot's of people having the same problems. My computers are way above the min spec and that isn't the reason why this game is so flaky.
They play Far Cry 2 and Left 4 Dead great as well as COD4 at max settings.

Issues aside I'd give the game a 2 out of 5 stars based on the SP campaign and the overall quality of the MP maps.

3) The AI sucks. The enemies pretty much line up to die. The only problem is your gun has a bent site or something so you can sometimes miss a head shot from 2 feet away. Maybe they did that on purpose to make the game harder and cover up the lousy AI.

Sim City 4 Deluxe is too buggy to play...

Worse then the play options was the setting up of the game... It takes 2 discs to install - the second disc however was bad/blank... my computers couldn't see ANY data on the disc and the install wouldn't complete- I had to borrow the 2nd disc from someone else to complete the install- if I didn't know someone with it I'd be out of luck.

Everything about this box is annoying like this... avoid it- this isn't the Sim City you remember. :(

Also laptop users- FYI- the outside of the box says that laptop video cards (even if they meet the 128 MB memory requirement) are NOT SUPPORTED- they may work, they may not and if they don't the publisher doesn't want to hear about it- so don't waste your money or time if you planned to use this on a laptop.",Great concept but still too buggy to play - skip it.,1238803200,6,,

Better than Uncharted 2.  Better than Witcher.  I held out for a while because I never played the Souls series so wasn't sure I would appreciate it on the same level.  Finally picked up a cheap copy to see what all the hype is about.

Wow.  Five hours in now and I just don't understand what makes this an incredible game to so many people.  It reminds me of the Darksiders series.  A run of the mill hack and slash on rails with a high skill ceiling but not much in terms of narrative or exploration.  The graphics also have not aged well for a 2015 release.  Despite this games incredible popularity there has been no remaster or 4K update for PS Pro.  Most other exclusives got one so this seems a really odd omission by Sony.

* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that.

The characters, story, interface were all turning out to be so much better than 999 which I enjoyed a lot. The different paths are easier to navigate and there's a lot less overlap between the paths which means less replaying the same thing over again. A small problem I had in 999 is that the characters sometimes seemed to over explain and repeat themselves a lot, as if the writers didn't trust the gamer to be able to pay attention and figure things out themselves. I never really noticed this in Zero Escape and it's also alleviated by there being a hard and easy option where characters give less hints. Overall Zero escape took all the great things about 999 and fixed virtually every little thing they could of with it. I was enjoying the game a lot and I would have recommended the game to anyone, HOWEVER...

There's a major bug in the 3DS version. After playing for 22 hours my save file became corrupted after saving in the PEC room. I lost all my progress. I desperately want to finish the story yet replaying 22 hours of text without being able to skip through it does not sound fun... The bug happens if you save in the PEC room which is a thing I think a lot of people will do. I've also read the bug might happen if you save in any puzzle room so actually don't save at all during puzzle sections. The bug was present in the Japanese version so the producers had to know about it yet they didn't fix it. The game is amazing except for the bug which can end up destroying your whole experience so I'd say buy the vita version instead which I hear, but am not sure, doesn't have the bug.",My most hated favorite game (3DS version),1352505600,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Pros:
1) a decent remote that lets you control other devices (to a certain point i will get to that in the cons)
2) the feel of the remote and the button controls are well made
3) runs Netflix and PS4 Bluray player really good

Ok not the not so good about this remote

cons:
1) yes it lets you control other devices but it a total mess with the button function for example when you use the volume control on a TV it goes into the main menu instead when you press option button it changes the TV channel and I am using it on a Sony TV

2) volume punch through didn't work for me I tried the instruction and it a no go for me I really don't understand it I am using a Sony TV and a Sony remote why aren't they compatible ...

3) using the remote to watch Netflix and Hulu and other online media who ever thought of this while making the PS4 remote must like to torture people  it works fine on Netflix but for Hulu you can't even move the menu screen at all it just stay in one spot but you can exit from Hulu and that's it I also tried it with IGN and YouTube most of the functions don't really work

4) red light on remote is now constantly on after I set it up to work on my TV and Receiver I don't know why I tried taking out the battery's and putting them back in again also tried to check if there was a stuck button but that's not the case it can still be functional I used it on my PS4 and it works its just the red light is really annoying

5) Learning function is a joke i didn't work for me for some reason

I have been a fan of many of the similar games produced by Maxis such as Sim Earth and Sim Life and thought that SPORE might be the next iteration in the process. After making triply sure I could play the game on my old MacBook Pro, I placed my preorder. It was only when the game arrived that I discovered that an internet connection is required to be able to play the game - I had spent 3 months researching the game and this was not mentioned anywhere! And the computer on which I planned to play the game cannot be connected to the Internet (faulty modem which I do not intend to replace). Thus, I returned the game completely unopened to Amazon.com (that part at least was painless).
What upsets me about all this is that I was personally looking foreward to a game where I could essentially muck about with fun creature designs, the game be damned. I wanted to make critters! To my dismay, even the Creature Creator software is Internet-dependent. And from the recent reviews I've been reading, EA is acting like Serious Cybernetics and telling people with legitimate issues to ""go stick your head in a pig"" (quote from ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" original radio play).
This just reminds me of the fact that EA is such a nasty company. They have never had good customer relations and their complaints department is nonexistent as far as I have heard from disappointed friends who had issues with their sports games. Someone working in my local video gaming specialty store has told me that they get more complaints and returns related to EA games than any other company. One wonders how they can stay in business. Personally, I will never buy another EA product if I can help it! If you're smart, you won't either.

Update 7/14/2013: I realized that I have not made a distinction between EA and MAXIS. MAXIS games are almost always good ideas and have something to recommend them, even if the execution is a bit flawed. The problem is that they have got themselves in bed with EA Games for the purposes of distribution and that always seems to kill whatever good they try to do.

1.0,False,"03 17, 2001",A3OVLT4OH7O0KU,B000056WU9,waddellm,"Wow, where to begin.  I popped this game into my PS2 after several months of Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001.  I had forgotten how crappy the Triple Play series had declined to, but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back.  I had to force myself to finish a season last year with TP 2001.  I finished 1st with 116 wins (only because I quit trying after the all-star break to try and make it a little more competitive).  I had 95 homeruns and 196 RBI's with a player I created.  I could mention the errors in TP 2001 all day but won't because I am reviewing Triple Play for the PS2.  The graphics are a given, as is true with every PS2 game, so there's no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics.  The gameplay is virtually UNCHANGED from the PS1 series!!!  I can't believe with today's technology, they couldn't produce a better product.  I haven't played the game very much because of terrible boredom, so some of my facts may be inaccurate, but I doubt it.  The baserunning still feels like you're playing T-ball in kindergarten.  If you hit a line drive to the wall in right-center, most of the time your runner only gets a single because he's too slow to make it to second.  Not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third.... on a ball hit to the wall that should be a stand-up double for the hitter, and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate!!!  Instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning, which explains why you can have 3 runs on 25 hits when the game is over and batting averages over .700 for the season!!  The AI (Artificial Intelligence) is absulutely horrible.  Ex. The computer has a runner on second base.  The hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the SS.  It takes the outfielder 10 seconds to get to the ball, which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield, and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time.  EVERY TIME!  The runner never scores from 2nd on a single.  The computer never steals bases.  The only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall.  Then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a stand-up.  At this point I was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last year's PS1 version.  If there is an improvement, it's that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat.  That may help control batting averages a bit.  You can still get 3 or 4 hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays.  I almost forgot.  I was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and couldn't find one.  So every time I hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double, the AI retreats my baserunner for me and I get one of the longest singles in baseball history.  There may be a way to change that but I haven't found it.  Nor will I because I'm probably not going to play it again.  The game still seems very choppy.  The player movements are still sub-par.  Ex.  You have 2 outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman.  He snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base, taps the bag, and jerks back into 1st base position without breaking stride.  He should be going to the dugout, the inning is over.  I haven't played to game enough to know if it still freezes with 2 outs in the 9th inning.  It probably does.  Ok, the commentary.  When are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they've been saying for years.  The little stories that Buck Martinez tells over and over again during the same game.  The sound of the game blows too.  I use to play baseball and never did I hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite.  Is this what EA Sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting?  You also can't change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off.  It plays the same verse over and over and over again.  You're ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin.  It's worse than the ""Magic Carpet Ride"" of last year's.  At least Madden 2001 allows you to turn that crap off.  There are almost no options in this game.  You cannot customize your gameplay.  No franchise mode (not that I'd use it anyway), or customized level of play.  I could easily win 150 of 162 games with an all-star setting.  I think EA Sports has sunk it's ship with this one.  The only EA Sports titles even worth playing are Madden and NHL, and both of those have their problems.  Don't waste your money even renting this one.  I'd love to have my $6.35 back.  So far I'm not impressed with PS2 sports titles, but their day is coming.  3DO's High Heat Baseball 2001 for PS1 is by far the best Baseball Simulation I have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay.  Awesome.  I have heard great things about Akklaim's All-Star Baseball series for the N64.  I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both, but if HH 2002 follows it's predecessor closely with a few minor changes, I will never need another baseball game.

1.  The voice acting is awful.  When I first started playing Lego games, I wondered if the sound was screwed up since the characters didn't talk.  I realize pretty quickly that it would have detracted from the games to put voice actors in there.  With the iconic roles that were being taken on, there really was no point in trying to have someone ""do"" a voice.
2.  The dialogue was also pretty bad.  Iron Man kept spouting stupid lines like ""Oh Yeah"" for no particular reason.  The Sandman kept making the same awful jokes over and over.  I have nothing against awful jokes, but going back to the voice acting, they just weren't said with any conviction.
3.  Controls are hard, IMO.  I swear I was pressing square to fire/throw something and it just wasn't happening.
4.  It was hard to figure out what to do even with the non-stop prompts.  For example, there was a place where Bruce Banner had to jump on a web thread.  But, if you weren't lined up exactly right it wouldn't work.  Maybe that's more of a control compliant.

Design problems:

The stock itself is too small for most adult hands.  The spacing of the fore and aft grips isn't very deep.  This will put your arms into an uncomfortable position for playing.  The trigger is located on the front grip.  This is completely counter-intuitive.  This will force you to either hold the device in an unusual way or operate the trigger with your less-dominant hand.

You are forced to ""assemble"" the controller before use:

Remove a cover plate
Lock the Wii remote into the forward portion of the stock
Unlatch the Nunchuck cord holder (which is very flimsy)
Insert the Nunchuck
Feed the Nunchuck cord under the stock
Wrap the Nunchuck cord inside the stock
Relatch the Nunchuck cord holder
Cover up the wrapped Nunchuck cord with the cover plate
Feed the Nunchuck cord to the Wii remote
Figure out what to do with the dangling Wii remote's wrist strap (Nintendo doesn't provide any mechanism for this)

After that process you can finally use the glorified Wii controller mount.  Was that worth your effort?  No way.  Placing the Wii's controller in a gun-style stock is nonsensical.  Your sighting down the device in no way relates to the reticle's placement on the screen.  This is a limitation of the Wii's sensor bar.  It's a one-size-fits-all affair so it can't be calibrated very precisely (besides top of the set versus bottom).  The top (face) buttons on the Wii remote are impossible to use while the Zapper is in normal use.  You will have to hold it in an awkward manner to operate them.  The transposed ""B"" button (the trigger) seems cheesy.  It is sloppy in feel.

The pack-in game:

Link's Crossbow Training is a snore.  It's a very shallow target shooter.  The design is a direct rip off of Twilight Princess.  The levels don't even appear to be changed significantly.  Nintendo put the least amount of effort into this ""game"" as they possibly could.

More Wii shovelware:

This is another example of a company trying to cash in on the Wii's popularity with another sub-par product.  Avoid this like the plague.  It has no redeeming qualities.  You can actually be more successful at shooting games using the standard controller.  This only impairs your abilities.","Horrible hardware, Nintendo cashing in...",1198368000,18,,

However, is very apparent to everyone that is not completely blinded by their fanatism for Blizzard, or lacks one cent of objectivity, that Blizzard has transformed into this 100% profit seeking-board pleasing corporation with no other priority other than making as much money as possible no mather what. Look, I'm ok with companies doing that, if their product continues to improve or at the very least remains top quality. Unfortunately that's not the case with Blizzard, they are no longer this ""quality benchmark"" or ""standard placer"" on the market as the original Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo games did. And nothing proves it more than Diablo 3.

Basically, if you haven't bought the game, let me resume it in few sentences. They spent far more time in trying to develop this cash milking idea of real money auction house than they ever spent on working in the story line, mechanics, game depth, etc etc. I mean, as their crash-n-burn launch was happening, literally, their message from the Blizzard team on their website was regarding how the real-money auction house was delayed for few weeks.....really? That shows you were their mind is, while millions of players in north america were angry because they couldn't play their single player game that requires full time internet connection, according to Blizzard the most pressing issue at that moment that required inmediate addressing was....the fact that their Real money Auction house was down.

If you are a RPG lover, or just a player that enjoys the occassional good RPG and has played any of the recent ones...save your money. You will get bored of diablo 3 in propably a week or 2. The only reason to continue playing this game beyong the first 2 full runs (which happens really fast), is to farm for money or try getting the most amaizing gear ever which btw ends up being completely pointless because there is not even a PvP system (they say it will be released in the future, but they said the same almost 2 years ago about SC2 team support, market and other features, and still hasn't happened).

I mean honestly, coming to play diablo 3 from recently released RPGs like Mass Effect 3, Kingsdoms of Amalaur, Skyrim and others, you feel that this game should be free, or it was made by an Indi company. Err...nevermind, Indi companies have better inspiration and would've probably written a better more compelling story line.

Bottom line, a poor RPG for today's market, specially coming from recently released RPGs that are now half the price almost. Mediocre mechanics, 0 game depth and a story line that a 5th grader could've written better in less than a week. It's basically Diablo 2 with updated graphics and more streamlined and dumbed down interface mechanics and no comparabble story telling. Worst part is...... that you can't expect anything better than this from Blizzard in the future. Oh, yeah, did I metioned that the game failed to work for the first 5 days after lanunch? and that their forums continue to be plagued by people having horrible experiences with errors, crashes, unsupported video cards, and no less importantly a recently wave of hackings that happen on real time to people that have authenticators, double firewalls, etc... and Blizzards resonse seems to be ""your problem bro""??

First I was fooled by the hype of Titanfall, then Diablo III, and now this.

Pros:
- Nice graphics, sound, and gameplay.
- Adventure/light RPG elements.

Cons:
- Just plain not fun and very boring. That goes for the main modes of the campaign which feels like all the missions are just the same.
- Same for vs multiplayer. Not much difference in playing the levels. No variety?... No large 8 vs 8, 12 vs 12, etc. No CTF. No TDM. No invade the base types.
- Lots and lots of rinse and repeat campaign missions or objecives leading to it being repetitive. Too much being the same. Same for multiplayer.
- Playing by yourself is a horrible and extremely boring experience. I played a couple campaign levels with some randoms and it was a little more fun. I play online w/ a dozen close friends and family but NONE of them wanted this game so playing vs multiplayer wasn't fun and was boring. Probably would have had more fun playing campaign w/ close friends and family.
- Nothing special or exciting when doing anything in the game from start to finish. Walking around the planets, talking to people in the city, picking up new equipment, getting new weapons, campaign missions, and vs multiplayer. Found myself going back to my laptop, tablet, phone, or just dozing off/falling asleep on my couch.
- Online only. I have a couple friends that love campaign games but didn't know it can't be played offline. Dumb.
- Kicked you out for being idle. Very annoying you can't pause the game. Sometimes I'm in the middle of a mission but like to do things like start laundry, take a long bathroom break, or fix something to snack on for a few minutes. I come back and I got kicked out to the main menu for being too idle. Dumb. I'm in the middle of mission to get up a few min now I have to start over.
- Peter Dinklage as the main commentator is horrible and sounds very boring. Love him as an actor. Stuck with hearing his non exciting voice in all modes.",Overhyped. Boring campaign. Boring multiplayer. Not fun. Online only. Better with friends.,1410566400,20,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Over time, things slowly change.  A new haircut, new clothes, new group of friends, etc.  The changes are slow, incremental.  Each change is only slight enough that you notice it, but the familiarity is still there.  You have your fights, things are said, mistakes are made (Ghosts), but you are committed and you stick with it.  Then, one day, you're in the middle of your routine and you realize that the relationship is over.  Your significant other has changed so much that they are unrecognizable.  That's what's happened here.

COD slowly lost the plot through previous years.  They've kept all the weird changes and updates from old editions, just layering them on top of each other.  This is so far from the fundamentals that made it great that I would not have been able to recognize it as a COD title but for ""CALL OF DUTY"" being slapped on the cover.

You can make your own class, but then you have mech armor/suits layered on top of that.  There are some strange choices in the tactical grenade menu.  They've kept that weapon/item that charges throughout the round.  Then my personal pet peeve, the jumping/jet pack and wall running, is still in the game.  They have now completed the transition from a solid, fundamental FPS to the dudebro, Dorito and Mountain Dew choice of 12 year olds everywhere.  This is ADHD in video game form.

The only redeeming quality about this game is the Legacy Edition came with one of the best COD titles and multiplayer ability.  Even then, Activision won't let me sell off the IW disc if I still want to play MW.  I guess I will have to come to terms with the fact that I paid $70.00 for a remastered Modern Warfare and got a cheap Halo knockoff  included.

After WCW started to lose popularity, THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games. When it did, even beginning on the N64, there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap. They finally succeded (so to speak, if that was their actual intent) when they started the SmackDown! series. I have no problems with the graphics, the entrances, or the sound in this game. I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.
First off, they gave the game arcade style feel and controls. Big mistake. They also made it more like the actual show: you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves. I may be in the minority, but constantly punching a guy gets old fast. I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat. Secondly, the game's A.I. has gotten extremely intelligent. Too intelligent. The game can kick your ass unless you're a great gamer, and I'm just average, maybe a little below. Mainly because of the counter system. The game goes like this: punch, punch, punch, punch, grapple, move-counter move-counter move, etc. You'll get countered excessively, and your counters won't work most of the time. Yes, it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV, but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion, it can't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go. I don't want to spend over an hour or more in a match, 15-30 minutes is plenty, unless it's a Royal Rumble-type match.
THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe. I honestly don't understand what the fans see in this series of game. I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work, and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering, than this is the game for you. If you want an actual FUN wrestling game, then I suggest you stick with THQ's WCW games on the N64.

The game tries to be a ""choose your own adventure"" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:

-The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.

-There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...

-The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...

-The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.

1.0,False,"11 17, 2010",AJ8VUUCO9RMX6,B003R3JNMI,D.L.,"Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.

You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.

The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.

I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.

The problem is with the execution of the game in and of itself (I have an XBox 360, so those are the controls I used).

First there is the movement.  The movement is in no way fluid like, say, FEAR or even old-school Doom.  The movement is a bit dull.

Second, the mini-games, the asteroid action is the worst I've even gone through...I tried to get through this for two weeks, did not work.

There are some interesting innovations.  The zero-g is interesting.  The slowing down of time is also pretty neat way of dealing with enemies.  Too bad that there are sections that, because you can't get through them, you'll never know how the story will end.

7 months in and I'm having problems. Mic Appears to make some white noise even when I mute the mic by pressing the button on the wire. This wasn't that big of a deal as I could mute in-game. But now the left speaker stops working depending on the wire position. Didn't expect the quality to degrade this quickly. Some other reviews have also noted the 7-month lifespan. Best spend your money elsewhere. Adjusting my review from 5 to 1.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I really like the features on these headphones.

Pros:
- Wires are very flexible, I don't feel like wrapping them up or bending them is going to ruin them.
- Headphones fit around ears with room to spare. Very comfortable. Wearing it for hours doesn't hurt.
- Headband fits head effortlessly. Just put it on and you're golden.
- USB connection is pretty much entirely optional, plugging it in only does two things, activates the lights and allows you to disable the mic with a button. With the usb unplugged you can still use the mic and headset, but you can't press the button to mute the mic. You can still adjust the audio volume though so that's nice.
- Visually appealing. They don't look or feel cheap at all.

Cons:
- To get the full functionality of it you need to plug in three cables. This is a little more work than required if you got a headset that was strictly usb. But I think using the audio and mic jacks is much better functionality. Key reasons being when playing a game, unplugging my mic doesn't confuse my pc. I've had the issue of unplugging a usb headset and plugging it back in, but the game audio still coming through my pc speakers. Much simpler to just use the headphone and audio jack. Plus you can use it for other devices like a phone or mp3 player.
- If you're looking for extremely high quality audio headphones, this probably isn't the way to go. I find that it's good enough for me and most activities, playing games with voice chat, watching videos, listening to music, making video calls. The audio is still good and clear, but if you're trying to find something with perhaps a deeper sound, you should probably look into more expensive headphones. I've found that I get the best audio from this when I have the headphone volume at max and adjust the volume on my pc.",Dying after 7 months,1456185600,,{'Color:': ' White'},

I don't mind having to go through some prep work before my first battle, but 45+ minutes is ridiculous--particularly if you're not given the opportunity to save before your first fight.  Yup, killed in the 3rd battle, never saw anything that would let the game be saved.  (This might something that was overlooked, but, well, it shouldn't be possible to overlook SAVING YOUR GAME, should it?)
I understand that a part of the plot is that the main character (Ari is his default name) blends into people's shadows, but the way he interacts with the other characters in the set-up is ridiculous:  things he says are frequently ignored by other characters, and at one point your reply options are ""Yes,"" ""Yes,"" and ""Yes.""  Why give me the illusion of control over my character if you're not going to respect the choices I make?

The game was launched in a semi-beta state, the servers used to play it (being online only) were also apparently poorly set up and planned, as many, many people had issues for a few days after launch (unable to connect, loosing connection often, obscene amounts of lag, ect). The item system (which basicly MADE D2 the legend that it is) is fubar, the item prices on the Auction House are hyper-inflated, due to hackers and item duplication already becoming a problem (funny that was the main, if not one of the main, reason's why blizzard didn't give us an offline / true single-player mode.. they claimed it was to make hacking/exploits harder to do)

The auction house is apparently what blizzard -really- built the game around, as they will make money off of every (real money) transaction that goes thru on it. The game itself is incredibly short and easy to max level on (i was level 60, the current level cap, within 3 days of semi-casually playing). Inferno difficulty, the supposed ""end game"" of D3, is hard and unbalanced to the point of being..well.. pointless.

Character customization and differant builds/playstyles? also gone. Everybody gets the same skils, at the same time, with the same potency. The only difference is what gear you are using, which will -ONLY- increase your skill's damage, or your vitality (hit points) or your resistence to various types of damage. So everybody will wind up basicly playing the same character class. EVERYbody. The 3 diff mercs you can hire once you find them? Also next to useless once you get into the later stages of the game, simply because they don't scale that well in relation to your own character, and the only thing you can do to improve them is their weapon, and 3 pieces of gear (amulet and 2 rings)

To summerize, the only improvement they've made over D2 is the music / sound effects, and to a lesser extent, the graphics. As it stands now, this very well could be the game that significantly wounded, if not outright killed, the diablo franchise. Had i known then (when i pre-ordered) what i know now, i would not have spent the $110 on the collectors edition, and im not sure i would have even shelled out the $60 for the regular edition.

Changing my rating down to 1 star each, because they have pretty much proven that they do not care what their rapidly-dwindling fan/customer base thinks or wants. This new patch has increased gold repair costs for your gear by roughly 4x, WHILE drasticly reducing or outright removing the effect magic/gold find has on chests, barrels and all the other in-game ""containers"" which can spawn loot. Now, it wears down your gear simply by destroying objects in the environment. What this means is essentailly they are putting an IN-GAME GOLD TAX on everything you do or are subjected too (fighting, breaking/opening containers/objects, dying) while reducing the amount of gold/magic items, or the chance to get them.","A good franchise, semi-ruined by corporate greed",1339891200,20,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Having been disappointed last year by the lackluster C&C 3: Tiberium Wars (which, like its predecessor, suffered horribly for speed and gameplay issues, while RA: 2 did not, nor did the excellent C&C: Generals) I was hoping RA: 3 would take me back to what got me into these games--fun, challenging missions, a bit of humor, and hours of fun.

What I got was...C&C3, dumbed down.  I mean really dumbed down.  I'm not talking about the FMV scenes or the hot babes (most of whom out-acted the ""professional"" actors who appeared in C&C3), which I was prepared for, but the gameplay itself:

--Units just about crawl across the screen.  Even fast-movers, like MiG jets, take forever to get anywhere.  You're forever jumping back and forth trying to see where the unit you just sent to attack is, if it hasn't already been destroyed.  And there is NO option to change that speed.  If there is, it's well-hidden.

--Too much power:  RA1 & 2 started you off with relatively weak units and gave you a challenge by having you overcome enemies using them.  Not so here--you're handed units capable of doing major damage almost from the start.  It takes a good chunk of challenge from any mission, which is not helped by the

--AI Commanders, or as I thought of them, ""cannon fodder"".  Using these guys means every mission can play out the same--you send them out to distract the enemy, while you build up your forces and go for the win.  That's fun about...one time.  After that it just sucks out any challenge there might have been, and you don't have the option to turn these guys off.

--Loooong load times at startup.  I swear, it takes a full minute or more just to reach the main menu!  Worse, it took a full 2 hours to install this--actual installation itself to about 1/2 hour, the remaining hour and a half was spent trying to stop the game from trying to install itself twice (running two versions of setup) and crashing in the process.

Are there any good points?  Well, you get some very attractive ladies to look at in the FMV scenes, and there's George Takei, who really plays the role of the Emperor of the Rising Sun very well.  The units are surprisingly varied though infantry is pretty weak.  Graphics are pretty.  Music is kind of cool.  But beyond that...nope.  Don't waste your money.  If you want real gameplay that's fun, fire up a copy of Red Alert 2 and go back to that.  It's 100% better than this waste of time.

1.  An internet connection is required.  (no mention of that in the product discription or from Amazon.com's discription.)
2.  No minimal requirments are listed.  (no mention of that in the product discription or from Amazon.com's discription.)  I don't really hold it against Amazon--it's not really their job to open up/test/evaluate each product.
3.  After I finally got it installed (and it wouldn't run) then installed Steam (and IT wouldn't run or allow the program to run--I assume because it 'has' to be updated--I am now in the process of updating the game/steam.  I have been updating it for over an hour.  It took 45 mins. for the indicator to show 1% had been downloaded.  In other words I probably 'have to have' broadband.
4.  I don't have broadband.  (no mention of broadband was mentioned in the manufacturer's discription or Amazon's)...and my 5.6K dialup will disconnect in another three hours automatically.  Unless I can pick up the download where it is left off...I am screwed/toasted/robbed/doomed/.

I'm sure everybody who is pro 'F.E.A.R' are gonna say  '...just rate the game oldtechno!...'  I understand, and usually agree...but not this time.

1.  I paid for this, it's my judgement call to make.
2.  The manufacture knows the game requires an internet connection.
3.  (If I'm right about the slow connection) the manufacturer knows you need broadband to download the steam update/s.
4.  You can't play the game without steam installed that first time to activate (the game so it will run--as far as I can tell).  And as far as I know, I can't install the game without steam.
5.  Therefore, steam and the program, count as the same program. (it is on the same disk yeaknow.)

Bottomline;
1.  If you don't have an internet connection;
2.  If you don't have broadband;
3.  If your system doesn't meet the below listed requirments;...

MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS;
CPU; P4 2.8GHZ (3.2GHz Vista) Athlon 64 3000+ (3200+ Vista)
GPU;  Fully DX9-compliant Graphics card with 256MB (SM 2.0b); NVIDIA GeForce3 6800 or ATI X700.
MEMORY;  1GB (1.5GB Vista)
HDD;  12GB
OS;  Windows XP SP3/Vista SP1.
DIRECTX;  9.0c 2008 November
SOUND;  DX9.0c complaint
OPTICAL DRIVE;  DVD (boxed only)
INTERNET;  (I just now read this)...Broadband!

So there it is--I've been screwed...again.

I want all of you reading this to remember...the industry knows they are doing this to us...but they want a bigger piece of money for their work.  Well...oldtechno is tired of being robbed.  Henseforth, no matter how good the game, if they don't list the minimum requirments/whether or not an internet/broadband connection is needed--they will get no more than one star and THAT's if I was silly enough to buy it in the first place.

I suggest all of you do the same...then you can tell about the game...afterall, it might have been you.  Now, if you all will excuse me, I've got to disconnect and try to install the 'Orange Box' games...I believe they use steam to...and probably that same broadband connect I didn't know about until just now.

But the main reason I'm rating it 1 star ,it's because the conclusion of the story it's just an insult to the thousands of fans who eagerly awaited this moment for a long time. After having invested more than $260 dollars (not including DLCs) on the Collector's editions of ME1 ,ME2 and this one ,as well as hundreds of hours of game play ,just trying to twitch every part of the games to get the most out the story ,after all that I'm extremely disappointed and angry at EA and Bioware ,apparently they decided to reward us loyal fans with one of the worst possible endings you could give to an amazing series like this.

I will keep the 1 star rating until they give me what I was promised, which is complete closure to the full story and an ending worthy of the series. I say ""until they give me"" because having read Bioware's blog and other info websites, I came to the conclusion that this current ending was probably all part of a marketing experiment from Bioware just to get people talking, according to them they did not want the game to be forgettable (and so far they have succeeded) I read many articles about this ,but one of them specifically caught my attention, when an angry disappointed fan asked them ; ""Is that it ,that's all the story for commander Shepard?"" they answered ; ""Hardest. Day. Ever. Seriously, if you people knew all the stuff we are planning...you'd, we'll - hold onto your copy of me3 forever."" ""We caaan't say more"" Does this mean that they were planning all of it from day one and they are planning to give the complete ending in additional DLC? I think yes. like many of you I'm extremely disgusted with the ending of the game and I think it's not worthy of the series, but I for one will give them a chance to redeem themselves ,I want to see what they hold for us in the next month(s) with the upcoming DLCs  if they fail to deliver closure once again ,then this rating will simply stay as it is and will not buy another Bioware tittle again.

Why would I give them a chance at all? Well many people don't know what it takes to make a game like this ,it takes endless hours of work and requires a lot of sacrifices from a whole group of people ,and well they did such an amazing job with the previous 2 games and if they actually do what I'm hoping they will do ,then I'd say that is worth giving them a chance. Many people say ,how is Bioware going to fix the current ending? Well there's a theory circulating around the web that by now a lot of people heard about, that the almost fully identical endings are not the real ones and that supposedly all the events from the last minutes are happening in Shepard's mind ,allegedly he is fighting whether he gets indoctrinated by the Reapers or not (represented by the choices made in the last minutes) and that the supposed continued ending (not changing the current one) will be in either a DLC or  an update. Now ,I really have no idea if this if this is true ,but it's what people ,blogs and a few websites are assuming ,though it seems quite reasonable given the facts of the current ending making no sense and Shepard's attitude is questionable. And also, having seen what EA's greediness is capable of (by charging extra for DLC) the pieces seem to fit together and as much as I'd like to say that I will not be paying for extra for DLC ,I think I'd be lying because all I ever want is closure to the story.

I understand that some people would call me a whiner and spoiled because I demand a better ending and closure to the series ,well frankly I don't care what they think, this is how the game made ME feel and I can't help it. It just feels like Bioware rewarded us with a slap in the face for all of our time, money and support ,it feels nothing less than a betrayal. I believe that the conclusion of the story it's probably the most important part in a trilogy like this ,because it should offer complete closure, it's supposed to show you the consequences of your decisions in the 3 games and how they have affected the galaxy ,tell you how things turned out for each race. Not just have 16 tiny variations and one definitive ending with 3 colors, that's just BS, the current ending doesn't offer any kind closure and it's just unfitting for the ME standards ,it seems like a 10 year old wrote it. I don't really know what people who like this ending must be thinking, perhaps they're not as passionate as I am towards the series. Though I seriously doubt that someone who has played the 3 games (and has paid full price for them) will be satisfied with the current ending, if they are ,then they belong to the rare 1%. I've also seen a few internet reviewers that think we are making a big deal out of it ,well of course they don't actually have to pay from their pocket to play the games. We do. They do not have that same sense of loss that the rest of us have and seriously I don't care if someone doesn't like this review because I'm complaining or by my 1 star rating ,you are welcome to put as much negative feedback as you want , it will not change how I feel about the game. I will keep this rating it for as long as it takes until Bioware and EA give me what I paid for and I know that giving one star rating to a game in protest may not seem like much ,but the internet and people united seem to be doing wonders now in days.

Now ,how can I review a collector's edition when I'm this disappointed towards the game itself? well in short I would say that the items you get in the C.E are unique but nothing too special ,2 XBOX avatar items ,there's a nice hoodie for Shepard for when you are not on a mission ,a robo-dog that all it seems to do it's walk around the lower part of the ship ,the alternate look for the squad members is nice but it makes almost no difference in a firefight ,there's also a few unimportant really short missions that are almost detached from the main story ,the art lithograph is OK I guess. Although the N7 patch looks nice ,it has Velcro on one side only so it can only be added it to certain surfaces. I think what I like the most of the C.E is the the steel case, it has that cool holographic color with the pictures of male and female Shepard on each side ,so in my opinion it looks great ,so I'd say that the overall package it's just OK , the ME2 Collector's edition in my opinion was way better and it offered more in game content with better missions. I'd recommend that people should only buy the ME3 collector's edition if you truly are a hardcore fan that must have every item of the game and you have a very optimistic attitude, because after finishing the game you will need all the optimism you can get your hands on.

I just got this headset in the mail and let me tell you , I'm really disappointed. The sound is terrible, almost no bass at all. Sounds almost like MONO sound. There is NO mute button on the inline controller, even though the question on this very page says that it does. There is ONLY a sound controller. That's it. The cord going into the headset is on the RIGHT ear and not the LEFT ear. It's very weird and a bit of a pain because the cord has to cross over my body. The microphone is overall less flexible than I figured it would be. I tested the sound that the microphone outputs and it's very poor.

Additionally, I actually have a big head, unlike some of the reviewers here who claim to have a big head and they fit fine. These do NOT fit fine on a large head. They feel super weird and put pressure on my earlobes which makes wearing these for even so much as an hour a poor experience. Lasty, they feel cheap when I hold them in my hand.

Many quest are difficult to solve because the quest markers are not as efficient and detailed as they were in Fallout.

my biggest complaint is that the PC version is a STEAM game.  Which means its time consuming to install.  Bethesda CLAIMS you only have to connect to the STEAM network ONCE to verify your game.  It that were TRUE I'd hav no problem BUT you MUST connect to the STEAM network EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME!

Excuse me Bethesda?  I shell out my money for your product, have the disc siting in my drive AND you want me to connect to STEAM to ""verify"" my game?

what?

soo if the STEAM severs are down or your ISP is down I can't play?

Yes that['s correct.  If you cannot connect to the STEAM server, even in you have the game installed and the dic sitting in your drive; you cannot play the game.

The scroll wheel alone has 3 different buttons (swipe left right or click) that you can bind to any keyboard key, or any other computer function, including launching an app. I believe there are a total  of 17 buttons that can be bound.

The game play itself is really great and the graphics are awesome. It's too bad that after 30-50 turns the game becomes unplayable due to performance and you'll never get to actually finish a game that you start.

People will argue that Steam isn't DRM but that's exactly what it is. I have the game on CD with the expansion. I can't install them though because steam doesn't work right. The game won't install while Steam is offline, so why do I have a disc? I don't know. When I go online, steam won't connect because either their servers are down or windows firewall blocks something (although I doubt that since I turned it off, but that's what steam says). People who pirated the game are playing it right now, probably reading this post and laughing because their copies just work and they didn't pay $50 for the first DVD and $50 for the expansion like I did. Of course the joke is on everyone because the game runs slow even on higher end systems. I have a friend running a PC with 32GB of RAM and two NVIDIA 680's in SLI with a 256GB SSD and even on that beast of a machine the game crawls to a screaching halt of performance after about 40 turns. The farm graphics disappear completely from the screen so knowing what is built on a tile requires you to hit F10 to see what's actually there or to hover the mouse over each tile until you find something that you haven't built on.

First off I would only reccomend this to a person that has not played the original Fable on Xbox. It's basically Fable one on the Fable two/three engine.
This is actually worse than the Halo one remake, which I didn't think was possible. The problem that was there was absolutely no multiplayer, it just included few downloadable maps for Halo:Reach. Anyway, same issue with this game, but graphics-wise. On the back of the box they said they just re-made the lighting... no they re-made the entire game.

All of the the unique art effects for the fire, the lightning, and even the 'force push' are gone, replaced by generic effects. The character you play as is hideous now, although to be fair most others do look well with their updates. The other one star review was right about the lag, it seems this game is always choppy and still loading even after it is finished, but I haven't had it freeze on me yet. There are bugs like followers not following you through loading screens also.

I am a huge Fable fan so i'll try to enjoy it as much as I can but... it's bad. It's always nice to see the Unreal engine at work, but this is a sloppy remake instead of a port, which it should have been because Fable one has always had very good graphics, it didn't need any updates, just achievements.

I will say again that you probably will enjoy this if you're a casual player, haven't played the original, or just don't remember it that well. It came out ten years ago, so most of the positive reviews will have a nostalgia bias.",Micro$oft did it again!,1391817600,5,,

If EA put out a Madden game this bad they'd be filing bankruptcy in a year.  It's a very, very, unfinished game, even patched with all of the updates to 10/23/2014 it would barely pass as a beta.  This is a case of a game that wasn't nearly done and should have been cancelled but was instead released.

Specifically, in addition to things other posters have mentioned, the game is simply barely playable.  For example, want to learn the controls?  Practice mode consists of you 1 on 1 against a goalie, no challenges, that's it.  No practice modes of any other type like defense or goalie.  In MUT, you can't even play the team of the week.

But this 10 minute long annoyance is just to get you to read the developer credits, which slowly fade in and out in the upper right side of the screen (maybe that's why you're on the left.)  It doesn't just force you to endure the credits; you have to participate by holding the joystick forward and following the guards, because they stop and wait for you, and the credits stop rolling, if you say ""fook this"" and throw the controller.  So for the first ten minutes of the game you are supposed to immerse yourself in the self aggrandizement of the game's developers.  Stupid, boring, and presumptuous.

This is a well known scheme based on a custom-made augmented version of SecuROM 7+, used for over a year now (from BioShock to Mass Effect, Dead Space and Red Alert 3) and it has been proven to offer overall...zero protection from piracy. But, of course, fighting piracy was never amongst its aims.

SecuROM is NOT a Digital Rights Management system but rather a spyware subroutine that unavoidably comes bundled with most major game releases. It borrows into the Root of our systems, masking itself from the System Manager and refuses to be removed - even after one completely uninstalls the game it came with. SecuROM is indeed used as a cloaked dataminer, gathering information on the system and its user's activities and sending them to its mothership. It is the method the industry's behemoths chose to pave the way for their coveted Pay-per-Play future.

Turning our own PCs into their...insatiable coiners is what the gaming executives are having wet dreams about. Games that we will have to keep paying for again and again.
And that is where the idea of Limited Activations comes ins: not only it nullifies the value of a game once bought, killing the second-hand market overnight, but it also familiarizes gamers to the idea of having to buy the same game over and over in order to keep playing it.

NEED FOR SPEED was a series I loved in the past and would love to keep playing in the future once the DRM idiocies get resolved. But not at this price.
Some people are indifferent to these issues - and I respect that. In a free market voting with one's wallet is the most effective expression of opinion - and everyone is free to cast his vote in whichever direction he seems fit. My experience though taught me that most gamers would like, at least, to make well informed decisions.

""Look at me, I'm so cool because I have a PSP.  PSPs are for grown ups, you know.  Only little 4 year old kids play Nintendo.""  It's ironic how the ""mature"" gamers are saying such immature things.  (Most of these ""mature"" gamers are in their teens, oddly enough.  I laugh at any loser who is above the age of 20 and says these kinds of things.  lol losers.)  Anyhow, that was just my rant about some of the Sony fanboys, now onto the PSP.

The first thing you'll notice about the PSP is that it's quite sleek and provacative.  It's an eye-catcher for sure, but's that's about the only thing it's good for, show.  Here I'll list of a few things that make the PSP very undesirable.

The Screen.  OK so you look at the screen and notice just how large and sharp it is compared to Nintendo's GBA SP and NDS.  However, there is a major drawback with it because it's plagued with a lot of dead pixels.  I cannot stand playing with dead pixels because they always divert my attention from the game (of course that's not such a big problem seeing as how the PSP has no games worth playing).  Also, since it is so large, it gets in the way of the Square button, making it unresponsive, and making enjoyment an impossibility.

The Design.  Again, the screen gets in the way of the square button.  The analogue ""stick"" is not designed well.  And the whole thing looks derivative.  It is also ver fragile.  Sometimes I feel like I could break it just by holding it.

Controls.  It may just be me but I hate all of Playstation's controls.  They suck.  I hate the d-pad and the analogue stick give my hand cramps.

Games.  Sports, racing, puzzle, and more SPORTS!!!  Proof that the PSP is for casual gamers.  (All the other games belonging to other genres aren't worth playing either.)  Not to mention some are rehashes of games already one the PS2.  Come on now, why waste time playing a handheld when you can be playing on a console, or better yet, a PC?

Multimedia Feautes.  They are crap and completely unnecessary.  They just eat up the battery life and your wallet.  There are other, cheaper, much better electronics that specialize in these arears.

Cost.  This is the big one.  The ""value"" pack comes with crap and it still costs me $250?  Rip off.  And that's only for the unit.  A game cost around $40 alone.  I listen to about 1 gig of music daily so throw away another $100 for a memory stick.  And if I wanted to get a UMD like an idiot, that'd be another $20.  So that's $410 (and I'm being modest here) for such a faulty product.  Ridiculous.

There are other, minor slights that I have with the PSP but they're passable.  I truly do not recommend this to anyone.  Not now anyway.  Wait a few years until the price goes down, Sony fixes the mistakes with this product, and there are games actually worth playing.  So that means you can rule out purchasing this fiasco forever.

Graphics: They are bad. I mean horribly bad. This is a PS3 game for GOD SAKES!!! There is no excuse for it to look this way. It looks like something the designed in a month on a PS1 port. Plus the characters moved as if they were simple polygons with a crisp clean makeover. You can't make out the difference between your teammates and the enemies if you are using any kind of turret.

Controls: Why on earth would you hold down a button to shoot. Toggle people!!! Toggle!!! There is no need for the action to stop cause your left finger gets tired. (Bionic commando anyone) And whats with all this button combos to move around the map.

Sound: The guns blazing and bombs going off makes you feel like blowing things up but the voice acting made me turn off the volume cause it was that bad.

AI: If there is no choice setting to make it easy or hard then expect to die alot. And I do mean alot. The enemies seem to know what they are doing which felt good and different but your teammates seemed like they had no idea what was going on and left you to fight the good fight by yourself alot. Which made me feel like why even bother to bring them back.

I know this review is long but I truly was let down with this title cause I like the alt history games and this looked liked something good to kill a few days playing. And what do I get? This crap! I mean even some PS1 titles looked better then this and played more smoothly to boot. Like the intro says AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Hell Star Wars the force unleashed held my interest at lest for two weeks. I would wait until there is nothing left to buy in the bargain bin before looking at this title. Only good thing is I got it used and going to use it get something worth playing. Side note to any developers reading this: STOP WITH THE R2 TRIGGERS!!! They don't feel right when after almost 15 years of pushing R1 to shoot we the masses are already programed because of this instinctively.

And FFX is just that. A movie with limited (and I mean LIMITED) player interaction, on a level with the horrible Xenogears. There are NO camera angle changes, and no 360 degree control. The game is TOTALLY and completely linear. You spend the first two hours watching young Tidus, a supposedly great blitzball player, whine and whimper about `his old man' disappearing when he was young. Not only is the voice over emotionally inconsistant, the pitch is irritable. AND YOU CANNOT X-MASH THROUGH THE SCENES! The `game' is in complete control thoughout. The plot is entangled (and I mean in knots) with religious conflict and political manipulation, the intricacies of which, as an adult, I understood and enjoyed. As a teen, I wouldn't tolerate it, and would be horrified when I found YOU CANNOT BYPASS A SINGLE SCENE THROUGHOUT THE GAME. While most of the backdrops are graphically superior, there is little exploration allowed. Your characters run only only on paths in area scenes, and there is NO world scene, and no control over destination. You only go where the game sends you. (I have 30 hours in, I hope it changes...)
But there are some redeeming factors here. If you don't mind watching another `Final Fantasy: Spirits Within' movie, you are in luck. The computer graphics are absolutely breathtaking. As far as ganes go, FFX is the CG feather in Square's cap,  especially the ocean scenes involving Sin, the mega-whale sized creature bent on destruction. I have never seen creatures and water displayed with such realism. On land, the trees sway, and I wish Square had invested as much time in the gameplay as they did making everyone's hair move in the breeze. The voice-overs were a step up in reading text after text after text (I turned the text off and just listened...)The battle scenes are copied from FFIX with a few graphic enhancements. The `sphere' grid' is a new way of powering up and learning spells, and is the most amusing part of the game. Weapons do not get stronger (you buy/find ones with different attributes) which is diappointing. Now for the Aeons, your summoned beings. There are only 4, taken from FFIX, with some very nice enhanced graphics. Unfortunately, the summoning scenes are excrutiatingly long (at least 15 seconds each and every time. Apparently Square was so enamured with the graphics, you CANNNOT shorten them as in prior FF games. You might as well get up and make a sandwich everytime you summon), so you prefer to leave Yuna, the heroine out of the battles. The sphere grid is a neat new way of upping HP and MP, and is actually challenging to maze through.  The side game of Blitz is fair, but I found the control buttons do not respond per the instructions. You'll see. And, the game controls the matches. I prefered the card games in FF VIII and IX. And for you mothers of 12 year old boys, FFX graphics are true to EVERY scantily clad female body movement, so be ready for Lulu the Black Mage.
I play nothing but RPG's and Res-Evil style games. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. There is little to be had here except for moving the characters in and out of the battle scenes. I have 30 hours into this game only because I couldn't believe Square would come out with another game/movie (guess I forgot Xenogears) As a game, this falls so far short. As an example of computer graphic capabilities, Square has given us the showcase of the year. And I do mean a showcase. This is the feather in Square's graphics cap.
I have played every FF game, as well as almost every RPG made. I cannot recommend you buy this as a game, new. I would wait a week for the movies fans to return theirs, and buy it then. Since it is totally linear, without skip capabilities, I would not rent this. You will have it a while. Perhaps I will update this after I finish the `game', unless I just get sick of it and move on.
There are several other Square games much more suited to GAMING. I recommend FF IX most highly, as well as ChronoCross (very nicely done), the sequel to ChronoTrigger. Also try, Legend of Dragoon, Star Ocean: Second Story, and Breath of Fire III.

Where I am located the game is unplayable. And, in this case, location does have an impact on whether or not you will be able to play Diablo. I think Blizzard underestimated the sheer volume of fans they have that live in an area where extremely fast, stable and unlimited internet is unavailable.

I have internet through mobile broadband and while it is OK for surfing it is not fast enough to play online games. I knew this before I bought the game but hoped that Diablo 3 would just use a connection to validate your character and then play as a normal game off your hard drive etc. but this was not the case. Even when playing single player the online aspect of the game is so entwined into the game itself that I was unable to play with my current internet setup.

Another problem is the lack of support for some common video cards. I understand a new game will not run on all systems and that even after a few years your PC maybe be falling slightly behind unless you upgrade but I have an Alienware for Christ's sake. It maybe be one of the cheaper models (M11X) but until Diablo 3 I had not tried to play a single game that my system would not run, this includes recent titles like Dead Island which I played with maxed out graphics for hours with no frame rate issues at all. Even when I took my PC to a location that had fast internet I was still unable to play at any more than 4-5 frames a second (with graphics and resolution all the way down) and my system is overclocked.

My video card was not only in the not recommended list but the completely unsupported list. I guess I should have researched that before hand but I never dreamed my computer would not run a game like this. I had to add a (-launch) command to the exe and change a few numbers in the instillation file to even get past the games graphic card filter to attempt to play it (there is a guide online for this). I bought my copy from Walmart which means I can not return it. It makes me mad that Blizzard would block some users from even trying to play the game they purchased especially for those of us who can not return it.

I activated a new internet service with a slightly better ping which was the best I could do in my area but was unable to log on for most of the entire day due to the servers being overloaded. Even after the launch day storm is over, and even if I could play the game, I would not appreciate having to rely on servers to play a game that I purchased.

I always loved the first two games because I could play them offline but forcing players to have an internet connection is a bad choice and I think Blizzard will lose many fans over it. The best I can do now is wait a few years until I have the money and actually need a new system since I can't upgrade the graphics card in my model and hope someone hacks it and releases a patch of sorts to allow offline play. Funny, if you think about it, the choice to force players to connect to the internet in hopes of preventing people from altering the game in anyway may promote people to do just that.",Not what I was hopping for.,1337299200,23,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

Etekcity Scroll X1 (M555) 2400 DPI Wired USB, for a similar price.  Its surprising how the heft of the item impact perceived quality.  The Etekcity is heavier but feels more robust.  Back to the Patuoxun now, I like the quick double-click button.  The DPI button is somewhat difficult to reach and is only one direction.  So you are required to cycle through all DPI to get the one you want, rather than an up-down cycle.

My biggest complaint - after using this for about a day my hand was cramping.  I noticed I have to spend considerably more effort ""picking"" the items I want with the mouse.  I think the resolution is messed up.  I still need to spend some time with it and see if I can get the proper settings in Windows 7 and the proper DPI to use it.

If I find a magic combination then I'll update this review.  At present, this will be relegated to my shelf and used on an as-needed basis in lieu of my daily use mouse.

EDIT - I've opened the mouse and glued in some weights to increase the mass of the mouse (see the attached pictures).  It helps it ""feel"" more robust.

It means that everything is fine one moment, and the next everything is messed up, or in other words Situation Normal All Fudged Up. So I bought these cables and they worked fine; the picture was better and everything that I said it was and everthing was fine. Then I tried to move the system and I had to take the cable out. Now I remember it being a tight fit going in, but some cables are just like that, but getting them out was ridiculous. I tried to be gentle but it just split in half leaving the connector in my system and the casing in my hand. Not cool. I took some needle nose pliers to get them out, and taped the casing together around the connector. It worked once more and I was willing to just accept that. I was then having trouble with my DC and had to take them out again, same thing happened. Now they don't work at all. Now I immagine this is just this off brand that has the issue so I you could get a pair of official cables that would be the best. I would buy another set but I think I would have the same problem.

My reccomendation now is to get the VGA box. Yes, it is more exepensive and combersome, but for the extra $15 is costs (as long as you have the cables) you can get all of your video options in one place. Many people have a VGA option on their HD sets anymore and even if you're just using the S Video option it's nice to have everything there.

The quests are in depth, and really fun as long as you stick to the main quest, (though some of the side quests can get pretty old...)

The only complaint I have about this game is the Corruption of game files. It's not a game play-problem, but a programming one. One glaring and horrific enough that you'd think they'd fix it before the game was released.

I bought this game as a present for my boyfriend and we played for over 10 hours on our first run. We loaded the game up fine a few subsequent times, but two days later we try to load up and suddenly his character is corrupted! A level 26 Beserker gone in an instant. I looked online and apparently this is a common problem that the game programmers didn't fix before releasing, (which doesn't make me think much of them, despite the awesome game.)

I'm currently powerlevel-ing him up, but it doesn't go fast or easy with my 26 Hunter. The point is, I shouldn't have too. It's frustrating and annoying as frilly heck and I resent it like you wouldn't believe.

I've read that the problem comes from not going in and saving properly, (apparently auto-saving isn't reliable,) and shutting off the game during play, or from having the power go out while you're auto-saving. Another thing is that if you get disconnected from Xbox Live don't reconnect right away. Quit and save and THEN reconnect, or there's a chance your file will corrupt too.

Way too much fricking corruption.

I've only gotten to play a couple of single player games after many tries of not being able to connect, and the games dropped out and lagged. Besides the graphics, I am not sure how much of the game is really better than D2 though my experience is limited since I can't get into a game.

Instead of supporting the stupidity of large corporate gaming companies that are ok with causing as much hassle/frustration as they can get away with, it's time to switch to indie games made by other gamers that actually will let you play their games. I should have saved my money for Torchlight 2.

The servers now at least usually let me in, but I've had lag which will get you killed quick. If you pause the game too long, they will boot you and you lose progress from the last save point. Their servers hiccup - you lose progress and go to the last save point. The Blizzard decisions on DRM is most definitely part of the game and have lost me as a future customer.

As for the actual game, after years I got bored of Diablo 2 but it's taken only a couple of times through to get sick of this.

This does not change the fact that the game itself is lacking in nearly every facet that attracted me to the series early on. Where soul calibur 3 made the game as a whole far too easy, it at least spruced up the mixture with some laudable single player content (and the inclusion of CaS) that peaked my interest and engaged my inner geek.

This installment does not do that. Despite the half witted assertions of fanboy types and game elitists, the ""new"" fighting styles are really, honestly just minorly tweaked renditions of the staple characters'. The developers were so lazy in their approach to the game, that they simply reused the edgemasters revolving charge of move sets 3 times, one of them on Kilik of all people. The ""story mode"" should simply be called the """"hour and half long who cares"" mode"", as the actual canon for it is ""boring"" to say the least, and upon completing it I couldn't help but think to myself ""what the hell did I just see?"" I've heard from some people they found the dialog engaging, I didn't, to the point I skipped it every chance I got.
The offline arcade mode is nothing short of poorly done, there are no ""endings"" in the game at all, it's a purely mechanical experience consisted of besting the computer six times, and... ""restart, character select, return to [whatever they called the main menu]"". It's an all together extremely hollow experience, especially for the price tag.
Once you've completed the meager single player offering, you're on to the ""online mode"", which functions fine. And if you're such a fan that the online fighting experience is all you want, then I'm sure you're already frothing at the mouth, have fun with that.
The graphics are only slightly improved from four, and the difficult spikes between settings is positively harsh to put it nicely. If you're a completionist with a competitive nature as I am, you'll quickly find yourself livid with rage at the cheap AI and implausible loses that come at the hands of the ""legendary arcade"" offering. I read a professional review where the writer claimed he racked up 900 loses just trying to get to stage 3. He must be far better tempered than I, thinking about my xbox under those circumstances calls the word ""defenestrate"" to mind.
Had this been an XBLA release, I wouldn't be so hard on it, but they charged premium price for a half assed product and poured salt in the wound with release day DLC that is confirmed to be on the disc, you just have to pay to access it.

My personal ""end verdict"" is this, if you're willing to shell out 60$'s just to play in the online arcade, do it. But if you're more into the single player and CaS aspects of the game... Skip it and get something else.

At the very least, I don't think anyone should pay full price for this lackluster offering, NAMCO doesn't deserve your money.

1.0,False,"09 15, 2015",A32B98JZ3RRALO,B00GLZQO30,Nathan R,"I thought Mists of Pandaria was going to be my most hated expansion of WoW time. And it still sort of is, really. WoD did improve on a lot of things from Mists, but there is one crucial thing that WoD is lacking-- a problem that the past few expansions has suffered:

Lack of content.

The thing is, I liked WoD at the start... but after time went by, I realized just what was wrong with it.

WoW isn't WoW anymore. It's a tablet game. MoP took you beyond the horizons of Farmville. Now, experience Clash of Clans! The most boring parts of it, anyway. In fact, it's become like a Facebook app. You can even... hee-hee! Take selfies! You also get raiding. Lots of raiding. In fact, that's all you get, other than missions. Lots of missions. The questing in this expansion was terrible. Beyond bland. The story was a bit ludicrous, and even at launch, I thought it was a bit much. Going back in time? Why, so you can lead up to another BC expansion just to pull back your BC subscriber base?

So, let's go down the list of things I thought just did not work this time around:

-Once you're 100... that's it. You're never going back out into the world. They have not given people any reason to roam the lands to do anything else but level (unless you collect cosmetic crap). No, the majority of this expansion will be spent in what is called your ""garrison,"" which is basically a Clash of Clans base with no Clan wars involved. Unless you count invasions, but good luck ever getting a quest for those to happen. Garrisons are REQUIRED, and cannot be skipped over, because the garrison was the central, pivotal point of the whole plot of the expansion. You have no choice but to buy the upgrades, put in buildings, etc. Yes... you have to do this for EVERY character on your account. It gets old very fast. And very expensive.

-The community doesn't seem better or worse from Pandaria. It's just the same old lazy players who can't suffer through more than two wipes of a raid boss before giving up and calling everyone names and cursing and blahblahblah. And honestly, I can't say I blame them. The raids need some serious work. I'll get to that in a minute. One thing I can say about the WoW community that I can't say for other MMO communities is that the level of trolling is over 9000 in WoW. I've never seen so much trolling in other games. I don't know why trolls are specifically attracted to WoW, but I couldn't count how many I've run into even if I had all day.

-The classes. For the many months I played WoD, half of the DPS classes were useless. My warlock had better gear than my hunter, and my hunter did twice his damage, no matter how hard I was working on my lock. And I loved my lock a lot, so this was very heartbreaking, for I knew this meant that my main DPS class was going to be my hunter. My rogue was pitiful. My shadow priest... laughable. My hunter, though. Man, he got a lot of raiding done. Given the choice between an average-geared hunter and a well-geared warlock, raiders picked hunters most of the time. And that meant less gear for my other toons. And that meant I was always going to be bottom of the barrel on them. They also removed half of the abilities from all of the specs, so now your easy-to-play class is even more watered down and easy to play. And boring.

-The essence of true World of Warcraft has completely diminished. Each expansion is drastically different from the last, and the past few have been more like all-new games rather than expansions. If someone from BC looked at WoD, they'd laugh and ask if Blizzard was making another April Fools joke. The changes aren't helping to move the game forward. It's moving back. It's becoming a primitive ape's game, someone who likes pushing big buttons and looking at pretty models rather than working together as a team. They need to come up with something new, not just copy what's popular.

-The rep grinds are atrocious. Okay, so they aren't endless daily quests and you can grind them on your own time... but you'd better find a lot of time to spare. Remember back in those glorious Wrath days when you could slap on a tabard and grind dungeons all day if you wanted to? Hey, bring some friends who need gear! Keep those dungeons queues rolling! Those reputation tabards were the best invention since sliced bread, and I never thought I'd miss something as simple as being able to grind rep while doing dungeons. The rep grinds are like this now: kill a bunch of mobs out in the world that give you very minimal amounts of rep per kill. There are some ways to make this go faster, for instance, grouping up with people and killing multiple things all at once in large areas like The Pit. But given the choice between looking through the queue system for a group and just saying ""forget it,"" I chose to forget it, because I realized none of it was worth the time to do.

-The raids aren't any fun. I remember loving Naxxaramas so much that I always looked forward to doing it, even if we were wiping all the time. Ulduar is still one of the best raids of all time to me. ICC... still great, even now. Cata raids were terrible. MoP raids weren't that great. WoD raids are just plain tiring. It could be that I'm simply exhausted of raiding altogether, and I've had my glory days and been through them already, but I feel like WoD raids are just rehashes of things we've seen over and over again in the past.
  1) Don't stand in the stuff that slowly kills you (it can be many colors, like grape purple, licorice black, lime green or even fire orange!)
  2) Tanks face the boss away from everyone else, and you always need a specific number of tanks, depending on group size. Usually two.
  3) Watch out for the big yellow text warning you about something, and then totally ignore it anyway (this one seems pretty important to people).
  4) Run when stuff chases you (and stuff will chase you a lot).
  5) Blink/Disengage/Displacer Beast out of the stuff about to run you over, or drip, or grow beneath you. Or just hop away. Or do anything but stand there, derp.
  6) Whole raid stack on top of some special thing that grants a special bonus to kill the enemy. Sometimes it glows brighter than the sun, but chances are, you won't notice it until the last minute. This ""stacking"" also applies to some dangerous debuff that will kill everyone in the raid if you don't dogpile each other. You think everyone gets it fifty times later, but someone still stands off in the corner firing arrows and murders everyone. Then they blame you like the champion they are.
In case it isn't clear yet, I really would like something new. If you've done one WoW raid, you have done every single one of them.

-Did I mention that raiding was the only end-game content available? Other than BGs if you're a PvPer. You have garrison missions and raids. That's it. Unless you're a collector (which I was, and I'll get to how even that disappointed me), you're going to be doing nothing but sending your followers on missions for hours in your garrison. Oh yeah. You get followers that you pick up around Draenor. They go on missions and bring back junk that's mostly useless, until you get one really awesome rare mission that you can't even get 100% accuracy for, and it's for a random piece of gear that might or might not be an upgrade, so for all you know, you could be wasting time and resources getting your followers up to a gear level (yeah, gear level) so that they can do the mission and bring back what MIGHT be an upgrade for you. Bored of that? Well, do a raid. That's all there is. You could do a world boss fight, but their gear is obsolete now.

-The garrison completely wrecked professions and the in-game economy. Professions have no real use now. Anyone can get materials for anything. Non-herbalists can pick plants in their garden. Non-miners can gather ore in their mine. None of the world's materials are worth anything, because anyone and everyone can pick them up. This means making no money from gathering, which was a big source of income for those who got those professions to earn gold. Mining used to be one of the top gathering professions for earning gold. Now, everyone can be a miner in the garrison. There is also no JC prospecting in WoD. So the ore is worth even LESS.

-Even the mount collecting, which I did obsessively for five straight years, got old and boring for me. At the start of the expansion they released so many mounts that I got dismayed. ""I'll never be able to collect all of these by the time the next pack comes out."" I didn't even manage to get half of the mounts from launch before another patch came out, where they released even MORE. Even I couldn't keep up. It felt almost like that was the only thing they had to offer in the game: more mounts, more mounts, more pets, more pets. It got so bad that I didn't even love collecting them anymore. There were just way too many of them. All of those reps to grind (with no tabards), all of those invasions... it's not worth it anymore. And it's definitely not fun anymore.

-I still hate the talent trees. I'll never get over how they destroyed them.

-Good luck getting into Ashran. If you even care about that sort of thing.

-Glyphs are pretty much useless.

-Bye-bye BG weekends ;(

So what did I like about WoD?
-No flying. I liked that I got to use my ground mounts for once.
-New character models. Some were better, and some were worse. But the attacking and running animations were a bit more fluid.
-Ultra rare mobs drop something for everyone in the group. If you all kill a rare mob that drops a mount, you all get that mount. Um except for when you kill Nok-Karosh, who only drops one single mount for an entire raid of people who have to roll Greed on it. Sigh. Never mind, it's terrible again.
-The instant character boost that came with buying the expansion. You know, so you can be terrible and be max level at the same time.
-Um Pepe?

This was the expansion that did it for me. I already didn't like MoP very much. In fact, I hated it (except for when Timeless Isle was released). I saw a lot of potential in WoD, and it let me down in the worst possible way. I thought it would be coming back from the grave, but it only dug its hole deeper. To me, WoW is dead now. Im not interested in Legion, and I don't even care about their store items anymore.

I figured I could return it and not lose much money. This thing is honestly a train wreck. First, the game recognized me, but I couldn't go further into the game. The point and swipe motion is flawed from what I can tell. Usually there is just a swipe, but this requires you point at the camera. When the game started, I heard Jillian and some loud bongo music playing. She was encouraging to listen to, and I listened. The game starts off with coin collecting. The game doesn't require you actually run in place. To be perfectly honest, a game that tracked well and required you to walk while picking up coins in the forest and possibly the beach would be a 5 star game. This wasn't that. In this game, the character moves by itself, and requires you to hold out your arms at the right point (on-rails) while the coins were green. Intermittently the coins would turn red. Then your character would stop, and you'd have to do exercises. I thought the jumping jacks were awesome, and registered well. There was another exercise in which you would have to squat as if you were picking up a bucket. This was also okay and registered . Then we got into exercises which just do NOT work with the Kinect, in my opinion. KICKING? your first kicks were kicking to the back. LUNGES? On the second easiest workout, you'd have to perform lunging and kicking on the same exercise. I would have just enjoyed running in place picking up coins, and doing occasional jumping jacks, and maybe some punching. The problem I find with these Kinect exercise games is that they require you to do too much. What about a ""Walk it Out"" type of title? Even walking in place would have been nice, but when you have a game that requires you to do a full lunge for the game to register is just too much for a beginner who just wants to do a half an hour to 45 minutes a day. Next time a company puts out a game, please don't include lunges that only registers full lunges.

This review is not for you. In any other case, please read on.

TOO LITTLE. TOO LAME. TOO EXPENSIVE.
Charging 66% of the original game's price for only 20% of extra content is disgustingly greedy. This is not an expansion in any sense of the word. It is an overpriced DLC - and a small one at that.
Are we paying for BLIZZARD to fix their game(!) or do we need to pay as much as a premium game to get randomized dungeons in a game that was way too short to begin with?
And, they are not fooling anyone, the Crusader is basically the Paladin (the most popular hero choice in D2) that was withheld and replaced with the Witch Doctor only to be the selling point of the first DLC. Does this mean we can expect the next $40 expansion to include an Assassin and then yet another $40 will give us the Druid? With these people at the helm of BLIZZARD there seems to be no low they will not stoop to.

TAKING AWAY THE AUCTION HOUSE WAS A LICKISH MOVE
Let me make this as clear as possible: the problem was NOT the Auction House. Some people liked it, others ignored it, me, I found it a brilliant idea. In fact, I have had more fun in the Auction House than in the game itself.
The problem was the drop rates of Legendaries. The entire game was designed in such a way as to ensure that it was unbeatable unless you payed real money to buy virtual gold from BLIZZARD's Gold sellers (remember all those PVPbank ""friend requests""? guess what!). After Hell level (and especially true for Inferno) it was impossible to survive long enough without full sets of powerful Legendary items. BLIZZARD made sure to keep the drop rates of Legendaries into the infinitesimal (a single drop after a complete playthrough. If you were lucky). Even at those small drop rates, it was still very unlikely to get a Legendary with useful attributes and stats! What is the use of a +300 Intelligence Manticore when high level wizards are useless with crossbows?  Hence the need for you to keep visiting the Auction House - where the prices were always kept super-inflated. Hence the need for you to pay real money to buy millions of virtual gold.
So, if they were able to milk their own customers for more money, why did they yank it out? Because, once the number of people playing the game dropped dramatically, it got too expensive for them to operate. At the same time, the class-action suits were amassing like a storm. More and more people lost great amounts of real money to Auction House ""glitches"", mostly after selling items - and the lawsuits kept coming in, one after another.
So, no, they did not do us any favors. And no one believes them when they claim to have decided to remove the Auction House because ""it was hurting the enjoyment of the game"". They just decided to take away a major feature the original game was sold with, just to stop losing some money.
You still think they ""listened to their customers""? Please read on.

WHY IS THIS GAME STILL ONLINE ONLY?
After 2 years the verdict is out and it is definite: BLIZZARD cannot run enough stable servers to properly support a popular always-online game. Or they are not willing to unless they charge you a monthly fee like they do with WoW. In any case, their servers are fickle as ever, prone to loose connection at any time, in need of weekly day-long maintenance and always ready to kick you out if you leave the game to take a break longer than 5 minutes.
Have you ever lost a legendary because the servers hiccuped just after it dropped, not allowing you to pickup or open anything?
Have you ever had a Level-60/Paragon-50 Hardcore character die because of a usual server lag?
How about having to start over an area (missing on that random spawning of a rare event), just because the servers lost it once again? Yes, I am sure you know what I am talking about.
So, now that the Auction House is no more, what is the excuse for not making private/Single-player games free of any need of an online connection? None!
The game takes up 15GB of our HDD. Are they going to lie to us all (like EA did with The SimCity) that it cannot run offline for private/Single-player games?

THE FORCED PATCH (Loot2.0) WAS AN INSULT TO ITS CUSTOMERS
Without warning,a about two months ago, BLIZZARD forced the Loot2.0 patch on all of us. This is what this much praised by the usual company shills patch did: it made sure that every single hour you had spend on the game up to then was utterly wasted!
Did you grind for hours to get Legendary items (or, even worse, did you pay real money to buy gold and then buy them from the Auction House)? Well, you wasted your time (and money). Those Legendary items were now insultingly weak, much weaker than Rare (yellow) items.
Did you make endless runs of the same areas, again and again (the infamous Alkaizer grind), to bring all of your heroes up to Paragon 100? You guessed it, you wasted your time. Now Paragon levels are shared between all of your characters.
Any time you sunk into the game prior to the Loot2.0-Patch was now very much wasted. So why would anyone trust BLIZZARD ever again and play any more D3? Next time they want to release their next DLC, they will not hesitate, once more, to render all of your time spend in the game totally wasted.

I don't think I've ever had a dispute of mine turned down, because they've all come down to this basic idea: you're not getting what you paid for.

I have been playing FPS titles since Wolfenstein, and was one of the first people to play Doom while it was still sharewear, and this one is perhaps the most frustrating one I have found--even on novice it is too hard. Part of this is because the maps have bottlenecks where, sadly, you are the one entering into a tight killzone where 5-7 mobs are well hidden and shooting at you. Part of this is becase the mobs are too hard to kill.

Maybe the programmers think it is cool to make human opponents that can be shot point-blank in the face with a shotgun--twice--and recover before you can reload your shotgun (which hold two rounds) and shoot you dead. Personally, I don't enjoy fighting AI controlled opponents with infinite ammo and superhuman resilience.

Oh, and just to make things even more fun, the mobs you are assisting on the missions tend to all die within the first 3 seconds of battle.

Also, I have seen people talk about the RPG-aspects of this game. There are none. If you play all the way through to the end, your character will have the same skills as when you started. And, he will still only be able to carry 50 pounds. While 50 pounds may not sound too bad, remember, you carry loot back to your home base and sell it to make money. Well, since you have to carry around first aid kits, and ammo, and food, and bandages, and 3-4 weps, what that means is if you carry around enough of those items to use on a mission, you are coming back with no loot.

- The gameplay is basically fun for a FPS on the Wii if you've not played any other FPS games on the Wii.
- The in-game cutscenes are relatively entertaining if you buy a lot of B movies and like to talk to the TV screen.
- Playing this is better than watching paint dry, unless that paint is on biplane crashing to the ground.
- The AI is basically worthless, so if you like killing mindless AI enemies, you've found your game.

Bad Points:

- The graphics are just plain horrible.  This looks like a bad dreamcast game.
- The well-designed controls are plagued with response time problems.
- Some. Maps. Slow. Down. To. A. Crawl. During. Combat.
- Lots of object clipping and if you're not careful, you'll get stuck under huts or crawlspaces and have to start the ENTIRE level over again (or save point, if you're lucky).

I've come across games like this that look good, sound good, seem good BUT just are not fun to play.  The weird button mashing - counter intuitive - controls in this game leave me bewildered.

Sticking is almost impossible.

I  bought the xbox version as it seemed most familiar for a sports game to me.  It's maddening to perfect a pass and shoot in the correct direction.  It's very hard to use the the right stick to select the ""off-defender or pass"" player.

Goal shooting is absolutely random - even in first person view.  Ball just goes off in any direction.

I played soccer from the time I was 5 until.. about 25... I know the game well and I know XBOX controls almost as well!

I'm generally a HAPPY reviewer here on amaz but please skip this series this year.

Gaming is in a funk these days!  There have been so many technical advances in gaming recently YET so many counter intuitive - counter fun - NUTTY decisions are being made by developers and publishers.

As a counter measure to any fenboi..  I should not need 7 hours of learning simple controls!

I still do like the game just a tiny bit and that is only because of what you can do in Create A Sim and some more detailed interactive content that I wish was in SIms 2.

Though they may have seemed like a great idea before but emotions are overrated and very annoying. Come on, why is she NOW tense from a fire at a neighbors house that happened an hour ago? Depending how your Sims are feeling you have to stop everything and go off and do something just to appease their emotions and it is a waste of time because you're only going around in circles. It's hard enough building skills and relationships without have to drop everything to go and kick a trash can on the far other end of the park. That's only a tidbit.

Content, as far as design. I still don't know what Maxis is doing. Why does Maxis still have a problem putting together color schemes and proper furniture sets? I don't know where to begin with that but nothing matches or go together. Everything looks 2D while the Sims are in 3D if that makes sense. However, I do like the way you can arrange decorative items without the diagonal cheat. So basically I liked the design tools.

Game play wise everything is at a stand still all the time. It's still amazing how you can do so much and it amounts to so little.
I still can't believe I bought this game for this amount when Sims 2 was cheaper and you got more out of it. Even the Sims 2 base game alone was enjoyable. The amount of content that was taken from this game is ridiculous. What content they took out were these to name a few; police, firemen, repo man, nanny, toddlers, aliens, telescopes, burglars, the ability to customize lots, family tree, basements, they added the pools back in but they are still limited for example no diving boards and there's so more gone. It may not seem like much but these features had content that came with them that made them and the Sims game more fun. Which this game is not. I wish they instead of releasing this game, delayed it and made something great out of it and not leave stuff out just to charge customers for it later at a high price. I would gladly pay 60 dollars for Sims 4 if it was worth it and not lacking the basics that was even in Sims 2 base game.

Origin is another story. It took 24 hours to install, each and every time. I purchased this back in Dec. 2014 and I don't know how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled Sims 4. Too many times I think. I know I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game so many times I've threatened to break these **** disks. This last time (around July) Origin updated itself and then I was no longer able to play the game so I uninstalled it. I had no choice, every time. I just reinstalled it (Aug. 30th) and this time around I make sure not to be online so it won't update otherwise I have to deal with it breaking again. I've played a total of 25 hours of game play since buying it and that was last year. Origin as a game launcher just sucks. I don't see the purpose of having to be online to play a game I purchased that's meant to be played offline. I don't care about somebody else content if I want it I would download it myself.  I'd per fer the old Sims launcher anyways. This is the last time I'll ever buy anything regarding the Sims 4.

I've waited for this release, but sadly, I will not be buying it. The DRM in this game is a deal-breaker for the following reasons:

1. Securom 7, the DRM scheme, installs itself on your computer and is as hard as a computer virus to uninstall. It requires making registry edits, and is far outside the realm of what most people are comfortable with Securom 7 causes possible security issues, system failures, and some legitimate software to stop working. It can prevent legitimate programs that burn cds to stop functioning correctly. It does not install when you uninstall the game. EA doesn't disclose these facts on the game's packaging, or in the game's EULA.

A very similar program was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court. The FTC's previous ruling against Sony can by found here: [..]

""Installations of secret software that create security risks are intrusive and unlawful,"" said FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras. ""Consumers' computers belong to them, and companies must adequately disclose unexpected limitations on the customary use of their products so consumers can make informed decisions regarding whether to purchase and install that content.""

2. The game has limited activations (5) meaning that you can only install the game a total of 5 times. I think I rebuilt my computer 4 times just in life span of the original Crysis (always chasing more frames, new graphics card, then two of them in crossfire, new processor {quad core} etc... With this new DRM I would have run out of installs in only 6 months or so! I will not pay $30.00 for a game rental, which is what 5 installs effectively makes this game. Even the version available for download through Steam comes packaged with the install limit and Securom, really calling into question the purpose of both: Steam by its very nature prevents piracy, so why would the Steam version need additional DRM OR an installation limit???

3. DRM doesn't stop piracy, it only hurts honest consumers like myself (I own, and have paid for, literally hundreds of games). Spore is a perfect example of how DRM doesn't stop piracy. It is now the most pirated game in history, despite this same invasive DRM. Pirates don't care about DRM; they crack it and then happily play their DRM free version. It is those like myself who buy the game retail that get stuck with all the crumminess of DRM.

4. DRM means you can never re-sell your copy. This potentially violates the doctrine of first sale, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court on more than one occasion. Basically, if you buy this game and don't like it or finish playing it and don't want it any more, you will never be able to sell it to someone else, because there is no way to demonstrate to them that there are installs left on your version. You can read about first sale law here:[..]

In conclusion, the game itself is not the issue here. The issue is that a really excellent game comes packaged with an invasive, draconian DRM scheme that cannot be uninstalled, has ring 0 access to your computer, limits your installations to three, and can potentially crash software you have installed, or even your computer itself.

This would not be acceptable in the case of a DVD or CD, so why would we as consumers accept it in a game? I honestly feel bad that Crytek got hooked up with EA and their malware DRM, as I love their games. I hope that by not buying this one (unless they change the DRM scheme) I and others will influence EA games, or at least Crytek, to steer clear of DRM that only hurts me and you, their honest, paying customers. If you want to learn more about DRM, here is a useful guide: [..]

***UPDATE***

YES I HAVE READ THE FAQ PUT OUT BY CYRTEK. Their FAQ fails to answer or even address many of the concerns with DRM:

1. How is this DRM expected to prevent piracy since all DRM (even Securom 7x) gets cracked almost immediately? (Take a look at Spore which was cracked in HOURS, not days)

2. Why do we, the paying customers then get stuck with DRM, while pirates, who pay nothing, get a superior copy without DRM?

3. I have problems with any DRM that installs in the background, is virus hard to uninstall, and has ring 0 access to my system. I am the administrator of my computer NOT Securom 7x, and any program that takes that control away from me is unacceptable. It is also well known to cause conflicts with legitimate software, and even cause some user's computers to crash. The FTC shot down Sony's similar DRM a couple years ago; this seems like the same thing all over again. Securom 7 utterly fails in its stated purpose, to prevent illegal copies of the game. So why is it still being used considering all of it's negatives?

4. Why is this DRM necessary on the Steam version? Steam, by its very nature, prevents illegal copies from being made.

5. Is the number to get new activations toll free? Also, EA has deplorable customer service (check out the fiasco for those of us with Vista 64-bit who purchased Crysis online and were forced to play at 32-bit, all while EA insisted it was our computers that were the problem, when it was their garbage software installer) and I frankly don't trust them. What assurances are in place that if making a call, someone will be able and willing to help us in a reasonable amount of time?

The Pros

This game is a really gorgeous visual treat. The chracters are rendered with a new technolgy that actually wraps realistic images onto 3d computerized planes.

The setting has been developed well. The village of Hanuda is a scary place cast in eternal darkness surrounded by a sea of blood and of course the Siren going off in the background.

The Cons (and there are many)

The game developers dubbed the game with a British voice over crew which in the beginning is comical but after awhile just feels ridiculous. For some people this may not be an issue at all but for me it just seemed distracting playing a Japanese guy and to hear him shout ""Oi Mate! wait up!""

Secondly, the gameplay is terribly limited and re-do's abound. More skilled gamers may not have to replay missions as much but I found it hard not to be killed as 80% of the time your only defense is to run and hide. The game employs a drop down menu to issue command to your character. The menu is easy to use but truly annoying. A good example occurs on the first mission. Your goal is to escape a bad guy via car. The drop down menu asks you 1) Would you like to pick up the car key? 2) Would you like get in the car? 3) Put key in ignition? 4) Turn key to start car?- truly gets to be cumbersome to game play.

Lastly, the game uses a event system/ time table for you to keep track of events as they happen to all 10 playable chracters. While that sounds convoluted in itself it only gets worse that you have to play all ten characters and not one at a time. The game is broken up into missions. For example,one mission may involve a journalist and reveal certian parts of the mystery and these events are recorded on the time table. The next mission you are introduced to a new character and complete the next mission and learn more. You must refer back to the time table to try and piece it all together.

Siren was a truly exciting idea thta really failed to deliver. I don't feel many people actually completed as I myself grew bored and gave up halfway through. If you truly want to be scared and enetertained I recommend Fatal Frame 1 or 2 as both are in my opinion the best (and scariest) the genre has to offer.",The Siren is warning you not to Play this game,1094083200,9,,

I love indy type games with unique control schemes and unconventional plots. This game promises a post-apocalyptic action-RPG with a unique flashlight searching mechanic and engaging characters.

First off, they don't show it on the cover or description, but when you load the game, you'll discover that it is made by Namco/Bandai. If you've played many of their games, you should understand the immediate disappointment at this discovery.

Gameplay:
  The flashlight mechanic is pretty terrible. Instead of a good lighting system, many shadows are baked into the environment, so when you want to look into the window of a shack, you just see nothing. In fact, the only things you can find with your flashlight are already surrounded by fireflies. The flashlight does nothing but add an extra step to searching set objects.
  The battles are clunky, slow, non-tactical, and repetitive. Your character has to stop in place in order to go through his attack animations. Enemies most often stand there and let you hit them repeatedly. Also, what you fight for most of the game are blue jellyfish which are supposed to be ghosts, and dogs, which you only feel horrible for killing. There are no real puzzles, just fetch key items and unlock the next area.

Characters:
  The characters are very androgynous, and I'm someone who never saw a problem with characters like Vaughn from ff12. Seriously, you would not be able to tell anyone is a boy if not for the use of pronouns. There's also a little girl portrayed as sexy. The main character cries a lot, and all other characters are only in the game for an hour or so each, so you never really learn to care about them. You sometimes find objects with memories stored on them, which might be the best part of the game(still not great).",Blows more chunks than bird flu,1408579200,,,

This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7.xx with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.

Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.

LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions ""on 3 different computers"" but avoids to clarify what a ""different computer"" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.

Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.

Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?
Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?
Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?
According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...

Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?

In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?
And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?

So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?

Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!

1.0,False,"02 11, 2012",A3DGCNADDUMFUL,B001CMIUYS,ZeeZee,"I've been playing games for over 25 years, and I'm a big fan of virtually all genres.  Console RPGs in particular have been a staple of mine since I played the first Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) and Final Fantasy games back on the NES.  Now, after subjecting myself to the first 25-30 hours of this game, I have to wonder...

Did they even bother to play test this game?

This has to be one of the most disappointing gaming experiences of my life.  It's an absolutely unforgivable game in almost every respect aside from its technical achievements.  The greatest problem with this game is that it's simply not fun to play.

For every hour of playing this game, I felt that the designers were punishing me for continuing to try to stick it out.  And it's not even so much the linearity that I find to be such a problem (I actually don't mind linearity so much), it's the fact that the whole sum of the first two disks could have been condensed into about half of the time it takes to play them.  You'll be spending so much time fighting in endless battles that artificially extend the length of the game.  If you try to ignore the battles, then the designers punish you even further with an unbalanced and stupid levelling system that forces you to continue to grind.  It's a total grind-fest at its core.

The battle system is terribly tedious.  Even when you have the battle mechanics down to a science, it's constantly all about the broken stagger mechanism.  E.g.  Cast spell after spell until the stagger meter hits its limit, then attack full-force and juggle your opponent to death.  Repeat this 20,000 times until your mind is completely numb.  There is no balance to this game.  It is totally broken and makes me yearn for the days when Square actually took care to make this franchise excellent when its creator was still with the company.

Back to levelling up.  The system is pointless because for the first 20 hours of the game, you're stuck with levelling up the characters in a way that the game tells you to do it.  It might as well automatically develop character spells and stats the way old-school RPGs have always done it.  It's just another way to waste your time with having to manually go through and apply your points to stats (which is also slow).  Hold down a button and wait for 5 seconds while your points deplete and link the next skill.  Repeat this 20,000 times.  After the first 20 hours, it lets you have more flexibility by learning any skills for any of the characters, but what's the point?  It penalises you even more if you do this.  And the game is brutal if you don't have the right team combo anyway.  The battle with a character with wings (I won't spoil it by saying his name) about 20-25 hours in rings a bell.  I fought it a few times and it was tedious.  Tried again with a different set of characters and beat him in less than a minute and 30 seconds.  What's odd is that was one of the only battles I actually liked.  It required some actual planning and thought to properly abuse his stagger gauge without forcing him to morph into total cheapness.  Finishing the battle (especially in 1:30) is really rewarding, because it lets you appreciate the game in a greater capacity if only they could have put more effort into the tactics side of things.

Which brings us to one more issue...  The auto-battle system.  I actually don't mind this system since it *should* let you focus on strategy in greater depth.  But it just feels broken somehow, and you'll be spending all of your time shifting between defensive and offensive ""paradigms"" (an absolutely idiotic name) since a lot of enemies are deliberately overpowered in a flawed attempt to keep the game interesting.

I'm all for trying new things in games, but if this were not called ""Final Fantasy"" then I am certain that the reviews would be even lower than what you find here.  It feels too experimental and broken.  There are many other games that have done a better job with the tactics-oriented play.

It all feels like a broken, but prettier version of Last Remnant.  Which, by the way is a better game , but only marginally so.  It's better in the sense that it is more playable and has a better story, because LR was a technical disaster (made playable by installing it on the hard drive).

Final Fantasy on the other hand is technically amazing...  At least graphically.  It's one of the prettiest games I've seen in years, even on the technically ""inferior"" XBox 360 version.  It makes me wonder why they needed any of the absurd FMV.  Get with the program, Square.  This is not 1997 and Final Fantasy 7.  There is no need anymore for *any* FMV on today's consoles.  They could have fit the whole game and its multitude of palette swaps, hours of dialogue, on a single DVD.  It's the FMV that requires disk swaps every 10 hours.

The graphics are not without flaws.  When you finally get out into open areas (I think after the first disk and again at disk 3), the game comes to a crawl.  You'll understand that the graphics are only good because you've been jammed into tight corridors with short draw distances, with artificially large backgrounds that try to give the illusion of open space.  The level design is misguided, and areas take hours to get through.  You'll love the beautiful scenery for the first hour until you are so sick of running down the same type of corridor for 5 continuous hours.  You'll finally be cast into faux-wide-open-spaces that look dull and run at about 5 frames per second. And yet again you'll have to fight hours upon hours of forced battles in order to survive in the next area.  Yeah...  This time it lets you skip this area entirely, but punishes you in the next area if you skip the grind.

The music is a bore-fest.  For such a high-budget game, you would think that they would at least put some work on this.  Tracks are uninspired and sometimes are interesting, but as a whole they are pretty terrible for a game of this calibre.  I find it so amazing that the industry music veterans are have left these big companies and work on smaller games.  E.g.  Uematsu working on the Mistwalker games (founded by the creator of Final Fantasy - By the way, all Mistwalker games put this crap to shame).  Or Mitsuda composing for ImageEpoch (Arc Rise Fantasia was a great traditional RPG game, if you can get past some of its localisation problems).  Even low-budged RPGs from Square, like Nier (which I loved), have top-tier soundtracks that best anything else out there.  There is simply no excuse for how bad this game's soundtrack is.  It's not the worst I've heard, but it doesn't live up to the franchise by any stretch of the imagination.

As for the story...  It's okay, but nothing to write home about.  You can determine the outcome from the get-go.  There are minor plot-twists throughout but it's nothing that isn't predictable.  The writing is amateur, at best.  As many others have mentioned, the game is littered with jibberish nonsensical terms that only make any sense if you read the game's built-in dictionary (which in some respects is more interesting than actually *playing* the game).  If they had actually bothered to *tell* the story, then they could have cut down some of the grind-fest in favor of good storytelling.  But it's like they deliberately tried to never require that you actually have to read something.  As far as I can recall, virtually all of the dialogue in the game is spoken.  In the past, I think I had wished that many games were like this and now I am seeing why it is a bad idea for both technical and game progression reasons.  Towns don't exist so you don't have to *read* any dialogue...  Ever.  You barely even have to read during battle.  It's like an RPG for 4-year-olds.

The cast of characters is laughable and most are annoying.  Most of the dialogue is overly dramatic and poorly written.  A times, it's campy but not done intentionally. The voice cast is generally pretty good, with the exception of Vanille, who you will make you want to poke out your eyes with that terribly conceived Anglo-Australian squeaky accent.  You can't even understand what she says half the time because they make her talk just to talk, and the dialogue during non-cinema sessions (e.g. when the just randomly talk while you run down a corridor) is generally unintelligible because someone didn't know how to properly mix the audio in the game.

The save system is obnoxious.  It encourages you to save a new file every time you hit a save point.  After about 50 save files, the hard-drive access starts to crawl.  After 80, it's even worse.  After 99, it forces you to start overwriting your old files...  The only problem with this is that you have to hold your right d-pad for 5 minutes to get all the way back to the first file.  Again...  Who play tested this?  It's downright moronic.  After a while, I just purged all except for my first 10 save slots.  Even that took 10 minutes because the XBox memory manager makes you select and confirm each file deletion, one file at a time.

It's like every dollar and hour of development was dumped into the game engine, CGI, advertising, and hours of voice acting, but nothing else.  Congraduation (sic) Square!  You've officially turned one of your biggest franchises into a tech demo.  This is what Square has become since FF VII.

These problems, are among the many reasons why I stopped playing this franchise after FF VIII (which was also highly overrated, but was at least somewhat more enjoyable than this garbage). I made a terrible mistake by trying to get back into the franchise with this game, and now they've turned me off for at least another decade.  I seldom buy Square games anymore, and if I do it's for the Enix side of things (a disastrous merger if I do say so myself, which only benefited a failing Square but tainted Enix forever).

If you want to buy a good RPG out there, there are dozens upon dozens of them.  This is not one of them.  Try any of the Namco Tales games, something from Tri-Ace (like Resonance of Fate.  Even Infinite Undiscovery was way better than FF XIII), Tri-Crescendo's Eternal Sonata (which is a few years old, cliche, but still decent), ImageEpoch's RPGS (Arc Rise Fantasia), Mistwalker's games (Lost Odyssey is great even though it's a few years old now), or even Nier (hated by many, but one that I couldn't put down).  But, honestly, stay away from this game.  Only diehard fans can stick it out, and I'd wager that most of them finally got off the bandwagon after experiencing this game.

I spent $15 on this game, with a gift card that I didn't even pay for, and still feel totally ripped-off.  I think it's because I wasted 30 hours of my life playing this game, just hoping that it would get better.  I just can't do it anymore.  Even if the ending is excellent, I'm done playing this game.  It's evil in disguise.  I can't waste any more of my life on this miserable game because there have been no rewards.  At some points, it actually feels like it's starting to get great.  It even gets fun.  Then it punishes you AGAIN and AGAIN for continuing to play it.  I'm done with this.  I actually want to literally throw this game in the trash because I hate it so much.  I have *NEVER* hated a game as much as this.

Ugh.  And yet I've wasted yet another hour writing this review.  I could go on and on and on for hours about the problems with this game.  There is nothing good about it.  Avoid it at all costs.

Now, shall we begin?

As you might (should) know, Assassin's Creed 3 is the third part of Desmond's story in the Animus. I say 3rd part, since AC II, Brotherhood and Revelations were in the same timeline, therefore they are included in one part.

After learning about the Assassins and Templar's mythology with Altair, getting the skills of a real assassin with Ezio, our hero Desmond now needs to find a way to stop the end of the world through a hidden technology left by ""the one who came before"". However, to open the door which protects this technology, Desmond needs to discover another ancestor, Connor, who hid the key somewhere.
And now we have a game. I will talk separately about all elements of the game, but first, general comment:

""Basically, AC III is an unacheved and unenjoyable game, and it destroyed part of the Assassin's Creed franchise. This is due for half to what I called the ""I'm a God"" syndrome by Ubisoft, and for half to rushing the game so it can be sold for December 2012.""

STORY (DESMOND): 2.5/5

Let's start with the real Hero: Desmond.
His story is very disapointing here. Not so much on what is told, but more on what is missing. Lots of elements from the previous episods, that were main events, are now secondary facts, barely talked here (1). Disapointing. And new elements added, like Daniel Cross, are not living up at all to the player's expectations (2).
As for the ending (don't worry, no spoiler), it happens in 2minutes total, even though it is the end of Desmond's story. Ubisoft is disrespectful against the player, who invested so many hours in this interesting character, only to see his story end so fast, with no building up of pressure (3).

STORY (CONNOR): 1/5

Connor's story is during the American Revolution, probably one of the most interesting moment of the American History! And yet, it is boring. If you avoid the fact that both Connor and his father are pals of ALL the main American Patriots (but curiosly never happens to be in Manual history), the subject is poorly treated (4). Ubisoft decided to go from one main event (Boston Tea Party) to another main one (Revere's ride), without linking them properly. This misrespect of storyline is ridiculous and sad, especially considering the efforts put in the history facts for the previous games.
Also, lots of moments show Connor achieving his goal (a.k.a. killing a templar), with no consequence whatsoever on the other characters around (5). This doesn't feel right.
Finally, the story shows Connor as a ""Pro-American"", even though it should not be the case with the general story. I mean, the Patriots' leaders are showed not as nice as we know them. Slavery is a fact, there is a huge political game, and even though the ideas they are following are ideas are freedom and justice, you realize quickly that it isn't as pretty as it should be. However, Connor kills Loyalists with no hesitation (but gets angry when the Templar do the same), takes the forts and put an american flag (even though he is saying he isn't supporting openly the patriots, but he is against the templar), and more (6).
And what about Achilles' story, that is kept in the dark (7)?
One last thing, Connor recruits some assassin's along the game, but you have to ask ""why?"". Ezio was a mentor, he is the one who developed the Brotherhood until it reaches full power. Not Connor. The idea of having recruits is the opposite of what Connor is believing in - being an Assassin is a mean, not an ideal for him, for most of the game. But maybe he is manipulating people... but considering he is not used to the political game at all -since he is an amerindian who has been trained by Achilles, he doesn't know a thing about the rest - that is unbelievable.

GAMEPLAY (CONNOR): 1/5

Terrible!
So yes, you can run. Yes, horses are back. Yes, map are big. Yes, now you can kill everybody just by pressing B at the correct moment.
But basically, you still have the problems of Connor suddenly trying to escaladate the wall even though you want to just run in the streets (I thought we complained enough about this in the previous games!); the horse is basically useless in the Wild, and slow in town; Buildings are small, so the feeling of ""height"" isn't there; And seriously, at the Frontier, am I the only one who noticed that you climb the SAME TREE every time?!?; the map are so big, that you need to Fast Travel all the time, or spend 1h to cross it, which makes the game boring.
As for the combat, you still have the camera problem of ""oops! Now I can't see a thing because the camera is behind the wall"", which is freaking annoying. Also, killing a group is now more than easy, it is trivial. Therefore, no need to be stealth, you can just charge and kill. You might think then ""what the point of having poison, silent bow, and hidden blade. Yep, exactly my point... (8)

And finally, BUGS!!!
I don't know if the PS3 version is better than the Xbox 360 version, but Bugs are a pain in the *** ! You have the classics ""hand through building"", ""weapons through the legs"", ""horses not jumping"", ""Connor jumping next to the haysack, not into"".. We could have expect Ubisoft to fix this, but apparently, they don't care.
But add to this, we have gameplay bigs and glitches, that makes you start again a mission:
- naval mission: the fregate you are suppose to destroy doesn't appear. You even have your XO telling you ""look capitain, the ennemy fregate is on the left"", and you see nothing...
- stealth: you walk in a group of people, hidden, you are not notorious, but still the ennemies noticed you and attack you..
- and so on...

Oh yeah, also, the last mission... see spoiler (9).

Oh, I almost forgot: charging time! Open world doesn't work well with cinematic (maybe it will be ok on next gen, Idk), therefore you end up with too many charging time. This cut completely the gameplay, and makes you want to skip everything. That is just sad..

GAMEPLAY (DESMOND): 1/5

Same can be told for Desmond's gameplay.
In order to make things a bit more difficult, there is no sign when to counter attack, therefore you have to look at your opponents. But the ennemy IA is just a mess... One example: when the security guards are firing on you, they are like the Loyalists with muskeets in the Animus. They take at least 5 seconds to prepare, aim and fire ONE bullet. Unrealistic, not challenging, not interesting.

WORLD/AMBIANCE: 2/5

One can at least says Assassin's Creed III looks nice. Great colors, different faces for the characters, impressive features. But this isn't a big jump compared to Revelations, where it was already impressive. I don't know how much work has been done on this, but the characters are not the main part of the work.
The towns? Yes, Boston and NY look nice. Typical, both of them, with nice buildings in which you can walk through sometimes. And it is sad, because this isn't used at all, the mission never requires you to go through a building.. A great feature lost.

The Frontier is nice, but unappealing again. The distances between towns are absurd, therefore you need to fast travel regulary, which break the gameplay. Hunting is fun, until you get bored and then you stop it. Btw Ubisoft, killing a bear with a hidden blade, why not. Killing 10 bears with a hidden blades, this is ridiculous.

Your homestate could have been a great place, an interesting and great ""secondary quest"" place to get invested in the game. However, it is soooooo annoying! Connor act like a brat with his mentor, and this relationship is boring to say the least. You never feel the father/son relationship, because Ubisoft over do it, and there is no follow up to any interesting point (10).
As for the other inhabitants, they are a little interesting, but not well developped. I mean, you have by the middle of the game a fully functionned town. But you need to go to Boston or NYC to by the weapon/outfits, you can't buy them to your friends. Really? So, what is the purpose of having a town? Crafting new items that you can sell to buy things later.. (11)
Finally, your house is the worst building ever created in an Assassin's Creed game. It is not well presented, with items everywhere but not clearly exposed. Your bedroom is simply an ugly block with a few things on the walls, and the assassin's underground is just an empty room (12).

CRAFTING AND ASSASSINS: 1/5

Crafting is the less fun thing of the game. You spend fortune, just to build something basic like a barrel of beer, that you will sell by land or boat, to finally get some money, to do this again. Is this suppose to be interesting? Really Ubisoft, that is your definition of fun? Also, why do the price of an element you are crafting is increasing for any new one? On the contrary, it should be cheaper, like ""100pounds to craft 1 barrel, but 500pounds to craft 10"". That would make more sense.
An advice, just reach the point you have Bear Pelts, buy them 240, sell them 1100. You don't need to go through the BS crafting mode, and you'll get enough money to buy the thing you need.

As for the assassin's I liked at first the idea every recruit has his/her own skill. You don't have thieves, mercenaries or prostitutes anymore. But then, why ALL of your assassins get immediately the new skill? Without training, they now know everything. It makes no sense. And RPG lover, you remember when you could decide how to develop your assassin, with blades or armors, and see them grow? Nothing like this here, the Assassin's Guild is a useless thing (and it isn't logic with Connor personality, as I said above).
The weird part is that each assassin has its own background and look. Then, why are they all the same?

NAVAL MISSIONS: 5/5

You heard about it, Naval missions are great. Actually, they are fantastic. To a point that you have to ask: ""Ubisoft, how can you make such great naval mission, and a bad game next to it?""
My answer (I don't know if this is true) is that Ubisoft starts to work on AC IV and naval battles in the same time they starts to work on AC III. And they realize it was a great idea, but they needed 1 more year to make a game. So they include small missions in AC III, as a teaser for BlackFlag, and rush the rest of the game. It is typically a screwed up way of treating fans in my opinion.

Here you go, I think I pretty much talk about every point I had in mind. My advice: don't loose your time on this, just read some spoilers about the story so you don't have to spend time on this terrible game.
Now there are some spoilers, so if you don't want to know more about the story, stop right here.

Thanks,

----------------- SPOILERS ---------------------------------

1) The fact that Lucy was a Templar working undercover, it is told a little bit through side conversation, but it has no impact at all on the story - even though it was the main event of Brotherhood's ending!

2) So, Daniel Cross is Templar who infiltrated the Assassins, then came back to the Templar. Interesting story, no? Barely developed, barely talked about... And even though you can forget the ""I'm freaking out just when I'm gonna kill Desmond"", you killed him and he's treated like any other soldier. Ridiculous.

3) Desmond opens the door, then Minerva appears and told him the truth: if he helps Juno, she will take control of the world like a Templar. But the alternative is almost everybody dies, the one who will survives restart the same cycle (religion wars, corruption, etc). Desmond chooses Juno way, says goodbye to his dad, then sacrifices himself. IN LESS THAN 5MINUTES!!! UBISOFT, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME ?!?

4) You are the one throwing away the tea, riding with Revere, organizing the defense of Leximbourg, killing the Loyalist's general at the Bunker Hill battle, but you have been forgotten from history? Really?

5) When you kill Pitcairn at Bunker Hill, you are in the battle, you run the whole field, you avoid guards, you finally reach a tree above him, and you jump on him in the middle of HIS campment, with dozens of soldiers around. This should mean that you are totally screwed, with so many around you. But no, suddenly, the guards are far away, you escape without any problem, and you reach the Patriot's General in no time. Even him says ""I can't believe it!"" Neither can the player.

6) Basically, the Assassin's Recruits are following you because you are against the Loyalists. You tell them that the Templars are the actual ennemy, but the fact is the Templars are supporting the Patriots for a part of the game! So what, your assassin's are stupid people who can't think by themselves as soon as they get their mantle (Oh I forgot, they will never get it...).

7) The entire American Brotherhood has been destroyed by the Templars, only Achilles survived. And apparently, his wife and son were killed. What about it? Why can't we see or heard about it? It has been commanded by Haytham, so why can't we play a part when the Templars launch their attack against the Brotherhood and kill everybody? And if you say ""because we are only following the story about the medallion"", then why do we have so much back story of Connor then? And I personnally believe that the destruction of the Brotherhood is a capital part in the backstory, and should have been told for the purpose of the game.

8) Taking a fort requires no strategy. Just charge by the main door, kill the capitain. Then kill the people around. Destroy the Gun Powder building. And raise the flag. So much for the originality.

9) The idea of loosing blood and the world is blurry when you kill your father, ok, that was interesting. But then, why do Connor go straight to Charles Lee? The guy is having a PUBLIC SPEECH for god sake! And you have 6 assassin's ready to help you, or you can climb the building behind, or so many other solution!! After you get arrested, escape, and find him in Boston, you chase him to the gallion in construction, which mysteriously happens to be in flame because ""Careful sir, there has been an accident!"". Really Ubisoft, that is the best you can do? You finally reach Lee, you are injured, he is not. You are weak and lying on the floor, he is standing. And he FREAKING STARTS TO TALK, like a James Bond villain! You shoot him, with the OBVIOUS gun you had on the side (you don't even hide it), but you don't kill him. Then you pass out. Why didn't he kill you now? You wake up, still in the boat (which btw, is not buring now. Curious). You are now suddenly at the bottom of the boat, walking slowly (lost of blood) to a guy you never met, who makes a joke (so funny to see a dangerous guy covered in blood, right?), then tells you that Lee took a ferry. Why not, but then, why does Connor suddenly appear in front of the PRECISE INN Lee is hiding in??? Don't forget he is injured, half dead, and it takes you 5min to walk the 100 ft to reach Lee. It should have take him 7 days to reach the place! And he would have probably die - I mean, the wound probably perforated his liver, am not sure how he can live like this, especially with the possible infection.. He finally reaches Lee, who is kinda waiting for him, with no weapon, nothing. He doesn't even poison the bottle, no, nothing. This is a huge middle finger to the face of the player..

10) Like the mission in the Cave, you get Achilles mantle 10min after - even though he tells you that you will get it only when you are ready. Or the painting you get, but you don't know his family. Seriously Ubisoft, want to know how real relationships look like? Play The Last Of US.

11) One of the last mission the doctor has, is apparently after a battle (no idea which one), and you have to find Diane and bring her to him so she can help. Who is Diane you ask? Exactly, no idea. I believe she is the one who treats Achilles, but you have no element which tells you where she came from. Once again, a ""could have been good idea"".

12) Why would you hid your weapons in the cave, old man? If you get attack, you need them ready! Like at the second floor! Do you want to get trapped while looking for your blade? It is not like anybody is visiting you, you can keep things for you to see, like a proud exhibit of being an assassin. Also, when you reach the place as a teenager, Achilles tells you ""the building barely holds together, it needs some repairs"". Why then it looks EXACTLY THE SAME at the end of the game?",The worst way to end Desmond's story,1371427200,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In this game you begin having to kill random little things outside of town in order to gain enough experience to have any kind of adventure for your 40 bucks.  The adventures consist of hours of walking, lame morrowind esque fights, and people saying ""take this to some guy in some area you never heard of"".

Often a set of options will pop up when you had no intention of bringing those options up, and those options interrupt whatever else you were doing at the time.

1.0,False,"10 23, 2015",A31MQQXUCCJZ1E,B013X9HA7K,Mario,"Nintendo to this day seems to have an extremely hard time figuring out co-op with Zelda games. In this one you have two options: three real players, or by yourself. You can't play with just two players unless you do the coliseum, which isn't actual gameplay, just sloppy PvP.  If playing locally you can both connect to the internet and find a third person, but I would much rather be able to play in say a car or a plane with my friend or brother without having to rely on an awkward third person to get started.

Now that I've had time to beat it entirely, I'll say this is the worst Zelda game I have played since Zelda II on the NES. Unless you can play it exactly, and I mean exactly how Nintendo intended for it to be played, which is with three competent players with a solid enough internet connection that you don't EVER disconnect, this is an unplayable mess. In single player you're given 2 'dopples' which are basically dolls you can control periodically, and why they couldn't let two players connect and have the third as a dopple is beyond me. While at first this seems alright, it's when you get into the later levels of the game you realize it was definitely made for THREE people and no less. This creates an enormous challenge for some bosses and timing puzzles that need all three players to do something simultaneously, which is near impossible on single player.

But don't fear! Using a life, you can skip the level entirely. This results in fewer rewards, not that they matter whatsoever unless you are a completionist, but also means you can immediately continue to the next level. In the end you'll be doing the three regular levels of a certain section then skipping the boss with a life. Sure, you can say ""I'll never use them"" but the fact that the option is so easy to use makes me believe Nintendo had to put it there so you could complete some of the levels without wasting a ridiculous amount of time trying to perfectly time three Links on your own.

I really wish Nintendo would make a Zelda game like Mario 3D World with drop in-out co-op, rather than a game based around such an awkward number of required players. Even Zelda Four Swords Adventures, which is a fun game, failed miserably in my eyes with the insane requirement of all players needing a Gameboy Advanced and a cable to connect it to the GameCube. If co-op is going to be so bad in this series, Nintendo needs to avoid it completely and just make more handheld Zelda's as great as Link Between Worlds which is easily my second favorite Zelda game.","NO two player support, BAD single player experience",1445558400,20,,

After trying to play this game second time, I got completely disapointed...

PROS: Not a bad idea for action game.

CONS: Awful controls.
  Slow and bulky mechanics.
  A dumb idea is - to do a close kill to gain a multi kill ability.
  Absolutely no way to remain stealth, but that's the only way to have a crowd control.
  So stupid to make a rail game with a tendendency of american football.
  Another dumb part is that Sam has to ""buy"" things. And note this - he can't he buy himself a good bullet proof vest... yea... just like that, huh, Ubisoft - there is no doubt you had the best game designers for this one :)

The graphics compare to Batman AA is so poor/gloomy (I'm running it on high) and besides that I didn't see 1920X1080 resolution in the settings. Batman looks much more exciting.

STORYLINE... Well, I don't know what to say - I guess they just picked one of those good old Commando ideas... So not inspiring. (eg. Hitman games got cool storyline. AC 1 got great storyline. AC II got okay storyline... Batman... blah blah blah)

I played this game for two hours and went totally cold to it (once again).

Sure, you have the usual updated rosters and a slightly modified control system for the running game, but paying $60 for a game that doesn't bring anything new or different to the table? Deplorable.

I've been an EA Sports fan for years, but noticed they were becoming too laid back with the Madden games beginning about six or seven years ago. It used to be EA always offered something new or different with each Madden iteration--along with fixes in the controls--but that's no longer the case. I knew I was in trouble when I looked at the back of the game and noticed that nothing new was highlighted with the game description. I found it funny that their main feature was ""New Dynamic Commentary""! As someone who owned Madden 15, I will say it is new. Listening to Phil Simms got tiring really quickly and anyone else was a welcomed addition. But dynamic? Hardly.

It's incredible that EA has produced exceptional NHL games year after year for close to a decade now. Many of those games are hailed as some of the best sports games ever produced--and that's saying something considering 2K Sports makes great NBA and MLB games. Yet, EA has gotten tremendously lazy with the Madden title. I don't necessarily expect MAJOR changes going from, say, Madden 15 to 16, but I do expect sizable changes between 15 and 17.

But I have to give the game a modicum of credit: The controls are responsive and intuitive. Again, however, that is a carry-over from 15.

In conclusion, it's time someone else produce NFL games. EA has become too lazy with this property and are charging TOO much for the same game, that's nearly the exact same game as two years earlier, and on a previous generation system. Perhaps give 2K Sports the license for a while? Hell, they work their asses off to make each iteration of their sports titles unique from the previous.

1.0,False,"03 8, 2005",A1GJCWUL55KKSU,B0007PLL06,ERR0RFILEN0TF0UND,"First I'd like to point one thing out: American McGee is not a huge driving force in  the video game industry. Although he did aid in the design of a few levels in the original DOOM, McGee is not a very creative figure. Although ""American McGee Presents:"" is everywhere to be seen on the packaging and instructions and intro screen, the game was pushed into production using his name not talents. Thats right, American McGee didn't even write the story. My one star was due to graphics and sound alone.

With that said here is my take on the game after playing it-and I'm glad it was a rental.

First I'd like to commend the artistic teams behind Scrapland. Every corner of the game is beautifully rendered. cityscapes range from the strange and imaginative to the old and worn away. Character animations are for the most part goofy but always fluid.

sound was also very well done. Although the scripts are goofy and childish, the voice acting is pulled off quite nicely by the talent. Sound effects are also  well put together. The dialogue however was the first thing that turned me off to the game. Although the cities are inhabited by thousands of robots, there are only a handful of different models and they all say the same exact things. I found myself avoiding conversations with characters because I knew no matter what area I explored, they'd all say the exact same thing.

The feature of stealing a robot's identity to gain access to different areas is prominently promoted in every article about the game. The reallity is that once you steal an identity, the police know exactly who and where you are and start chasing you around. I found that instead of hiding from them (its impossible) all you have to do is run to the entrance of the building you're in and even if they're two feet away from you, they'll say they lost you. Thats just poor game play. There are anoying little flying police robots ""Beholders"" that fly around scanning everyone, there are lots of them every single place you go. If  you pass too close to one while in another form, they know you're an imposter and a bunch of cops persue you.

The game play itself was another huge turn off. The controls are not very intuitive. It takes a while learning to walk and run around in the environments without going into other characters or looking like a spas. One of the features that appealed to me was building and flying your own ships to get to different places. The controls here were also very horrible and didn't convey a sense of reallism. Your ship can be flying  with full boost on and the second the accelerator is released, it comes to a dead stop.

Overall the game experience was not enjoyable. The cities were  beautiful for the first five minutes but you quickly reallize they're actually very small and almost claustrophobic. There are only four or so characters and you'll run into them  a hundred times over with the same dialogue so the cities are in a sense inhabited  by hundreds of copies of the same boring goofy characters. I think this game could be proudly commended if the goal was melding the muppets with adult themes. Adult themes? Yes, the most disturbing part of the begining was a close up of the ""betty"" character's metal butt walking away from the main character-unsettling,disturbing and just wrong for a game that seems to be more for kids, then again Scrapland is in a class of its own, its too childish for teens and adults and too mature at times for children. This game is compared to GTA in many websites.

In short if you're a sci fi fan and don't like the GTA series for its over the top violence and enjoy hot robot on robot action, look no further. For the rest of us American McGee Presents: Scrapland, is simply another title to ignore on the shelves.

Cons:

Goofy muppet like characters, Close ups on robot tail, horrible dialogue, poor control scheme, lack of depth, nightmarish camera angle controls, did I mention uncomfortable robot butt close ups?

Pros:

Beautiful graphics, nice sound, hopefully ""American McGee Presents"" will never be seen anywhere near a video game again.",American Who?,1110240000,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

When you buy a game for 60 dollars and then buy DLC for it for 10 or 20 dollars you are telling developers ""Yes I am willing to spend 70 or 80 dollars on one game"" and eventually they will start charging that. But thats a story for another day. In the end if you want to beat this game and see the end be prepared to pay even more, you can find the stories easily on google by just looking for ""final fantasy xiii-2 dlc ending"".

I'm bored with this game. I last about 25 hours into it and its just a generic, clich&eacute; and mediocre rpg like square has been making for over a decade now. Sadly the reason I don't care for square games is they care more about graphics and cutscenes than they do crafting a interesting story, well designed characters and a well written and overall fun game. This is no exception to the rule because it's obvious the graphics are what they cared about first and foremost in this.

A big problem with this game is that it seems like a really great game and that its very well done, but that's because you're comparing it to the first one that was panned more or less universally. See the first one was such a big deal to everyone being a major final fantasy title on current systems on 360 and ps3 that everyone got so hyped up and when they found current gen tech still doesn't make square games any better they were severely bummed out. So by the time this one comes around its still not a very good game but it is at least what the first one should have been. So then they play this and expectations are so low that even though the game stinks its better than most think it is. Kind of spending 20 years of your only eating stale rice cakes for all your meals and then one day someone gives you a ritz cracker. Sure the ritz cracker is just a plain old boring cracker but in comparison to 20 years of rice cakes you would swear that ritz is a new york strip steak and the best tasting cracker ever created.

I just very much get the sense of ""I have been here before......A LOT of times before and I seem to recall this being more fun"". I just found myself going through the usual paces, not really paying attention to what passes for a story because its either so uninteresting I can't be bothered to pay attention or its things Ive seen before in a hundred other games or its simply so poorly thought out that it doesn't make much sense. All the characters are just generic and sterile cookie cutter Japanese style characters. The battles are easy and not much fun, the fighting becomes very grindish feeling pretty quick. Even the most action packed cut scenes still can't raise an eyebrow or heart rate because they stink of the same style and flair square has been using for a long time now.

Was also quite disappointed at the fact I hadn't even gotten my copy in the mail and I reading news of the DLC they are going to release. It makes me even less interested when a dev starts pimping dlc before the game is even cold on the shelf.

Bottom line is I should have waited till this was 20 bucks. Its generic, sterile, bland, boring, uninspired, just like a dozen other games square has done and feels more like square pulling the lever on the register than actually trying to make a game.

Essentially I equate square games and this game in particular to a big budget blockbuster hollywood movie that's directed by Michael bay. Yes it has a big name behind it, yes it had millions of dollars spent on making it, yes its special effects are impressive, yes it's been hyped up a lot, yes a lot of people are talking about it, yes its another one in a long line of sequels to a franchise. But its also really boring because its designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's made to be like a shotgun blast trying to hit as many paying customers as quickly as possible. So essentially it has dumbed itself down in order to try and be as generic as possible so the largest amount of gamers will buy it. It has no personality, no unique feeling, no heart, no soul and it's no fun because it's purely a product created with the one and only sole intention of selling as many possible copies as it can. It wasn't created by talented people, it wasn't created with any love, it wasn't created by inspiration, no care went into it, it just simply a game created to make sales based off the fact it has the final fantasy brand name in its title and that is all. This game is to gaming what essentially michael bays transformers movies (especially the 3rd one) to film making.

With so many other really great quality games out there from talented developers I can't even begin to suggest anyone play this or purchase it. Between little downloadable games to other full price retail titles there is no real reason to spend 60 bucks or even 25 on this game. Want a newer Japanese rpg? Then go and buy atelier totori the adventurer of arland, disgaea 4, or runes factory tides of destiny instead and have a much more unique experience playing a rpg that's actually fun and tries to do its own thing.

If this game did not have the words ""final fantasy"" in it then I guarantee you the reviews would be a lower across the board. That's the problem with final fantasy is it's like rodney dangerfield in his old age; yeah he is faded, does a lot of dumb stuff and no one really likes him anymore but people will despite all of it still give him way too much room and credit because of his name. And that's what final fantasy is, its just a name that makes fanboys squee with glee and something gamers will buy even if they don't care for it just so they can be part of the crowd that plays ever FF game because it's a knee jerk reaction.

Trust me, save your money because you can buy multiple other games with what this costs and have a much better time in the end. Wait 3 months and get it for 20 bucks off ebay. Final fantasy is the proverbial old dog that can't learn new tricks and no matter how many times it will fetch the ball at some point it stops being amusing to the person throwing it and they end up doing so just because that's what they have always done.",Be prepared to spend extra for the ending.,1328572800,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I'm no expert of this game style at all, having only played a few levels of God of War II and Conan (another GOW clone) and I can say this one was in absolutely no way remarkable in terms of gameplay. It's the exact same thing---run around rapidly, completely defy physics, and use a messy mix of magic and swords and such, button-mash X or Y to kill everything in your path, button-mash things in concert to do combos and the like.

Rather than compare it to God of War, which would take up pages and pages, I'll point out where it's different.

There's a woman as the lead character. She walks around on a very odd angle where her back is slightly arched, giving her butt lots of perk.  This serves only the purpose of fanservice.  Sure, some sexitude in games is fun, but when it's quite literally thrust at us like it's the main selling point of the game, then it's really easy to hate the game trying to substitute PG-13 porn for actual quality.

What makes this game unplayable for me is the visuals. It's always a good idea to be creative with visuals, adding as many stylish flairs and colors as is tastefully possible. This goes way overboard in terms of visuals, to a point where there's so many colors, lights, and random stuff flying off the girl as she strikes enemies, that I cannot see the enemies. It's not a case of me being a befuddled old twit who can't handle colors or lights beyond the red, green, pink, and yellow of Pac-Man, this is a true catastrophic mess of flair. It's like that jerkbag in Office Space who wears a bunch of flair on his outfit. It's like an outfit made of flair.

It's just too much. But honestly, it wouldn't even make a difference---just buttonmash and they'll go away eventually.

One good thing I can and should say, though---the enemies die with great style, where flesh falls off from bone the more you hack at them, until they fully die.

But hey---if you like the style, and you've never played God of War, definitely try it out!

Let's talk about the whole game.  The first level is a sewer stage.  You dodge acid drops, mummies and machine gun guys.  Enemies are as poorly animated as you can imagine- nowhere NEAR suitable enough to release to the public.  Your character is incredibly bland.  You can punch, shoot and throw grenades, but given how unfair this game is good luck being able to use all this stuff correctly.

The music is atrocious consisting of the same ""Dun dun duh duh!"" four notes over and over.  You make it to the rooftop, battle the same enemies you did in the sewer (plus bullet shooting plants, what?) then find yourself in a truck driving fast avoiding gunshots from a plane above, and afterwards avoiding shots from a giant blue robot.  Oh and you *can't* avoid any of this.  And you can only carry 6 lives.  When you lose it's game over- no continues.  You probably won't make it to level 3.

Anyway after the chase, you're now taken to a room with spikes coming out of the floor.  I remember this... I couldn't figure out at first which game this reminds me of but then it dawned on me- Wizards and Warriors III: Kuros Vision of Power.  What a shame the company that made the Wizards and Warriors series would shamelessly rip off what is perhaps in the top 5 worst games on the NES (that being Terminator of course).

Now you're on the streets fighting cops and dogs.  The cops shoot guns but... they don't move.  They're stiff!  So are the dogs!  Is everyone frozen in place?  The theme song in this stage repeats just as mindlessly as in the previous stage, but I better be careful not to criticize this theme because it sounds like German 70's rock such as Tangerine Dream and the like, and those bands are usually regarded with high praise (and deservedly so for the most part).  You're now in a police station or mall.  I can't really tell which one.  Goodness these lifeless cops are horrible.

You now find yourself on the second floor, then climbing ladders outside.  Oh wow!  The only bright spot of the entire game- a car chase, and the music is really upbeat.  The music's good and this part is sort of fun.  Where did this come from!  Clearly the person who designed this car chase stage was working in a different room from the other creators.  But it ends all too soon as you find yourself returning to the straight path side scroller stages fighting more cops... then another car chase, this time dodging helicopter fire from above.  VERY tedious and difficult stage too.  It's pure stink, and it's overlong.  We're pretend the person who created the car chase stage didn't create this one.

And finally the final room- the factory where badly animated terminators try to walk into you (since walking into you is their main attack method).  You can punch of course, but it probably won't do much good here.  Shoot them?  Who has bullets!  You find yourself guiding the final terminator into a trash compactor thing on a upper hallway.  You don't use guns or your fists to destroy it I'm afraid.  The end!

Not much story compared to the second Terminator either.  I'm surprised you can even shoot- this game feels *that* incomplete!  Even more surprisingly- you can crouch!  Horrendous play control due to a really big delay occurring whenever you jump.  This means you'll shut the game off after level one in all likelihood.  When you factor in the equally horrendous play control, you'll miss your landings and fall down empty pits a LOT even when it appears you made perfect jumps.  And what's up with the life bar?  It's a black meter whereas the green is the empty part.  It's backwards!

- Voice-overs: excellent voice-acting, especially Hawke, who is one smooth cat.

- Script: Bioware's dialogue and writing is still among the best in the industry (script does not make the story).

- Skills: The revamped skill trees add a lot more diversity to your chosen class (rogue, mage, warrior).

CONS:
- RPG mechanics: practically non-existent or not in sync with established norms. A perfect example is how a dual-wielding rogue dishes out more damage than a double-handed axe-wielding warrior (huh?).

- Story: non-existent 'main story.' Its actually a hodge-podge of side quests - most of which are so ill-structured that one has to wonder how they had the balls to charge $59.99. The quest structure is too simplified and like the rest of the game, utterly boring. And then there are the filler quests. All of them have you stumble upon a random item (e.g. someone's hat) and turn it into a random, characterless person (e.g. a monk) with nothing more than a 'this looks like it belongs to you.' Ridiculous. Had this game come out for a mobile device or an ipad, it would have been great (but also, not on my radar). Angry Birds on my Android provides much better entertainment than this stinking mess.

- World: The biggest disappointment is the use of the same areas ad nauseum ad infinitum. I practically quit playing the game for more than a week after entering the Wounded Coast for what felt like the 100th time. This is shameful when considering the fact that it took me about 70 hours over a period of 10 days to finish the original game.

NEUTRAL:
- Combat: Its fun at first, but glaringly different from Origins. I did like the old system better. This one's just got too much blood everywhere - and the most shameless use of repeated death animations ever. Hit someone with a mighty blow and the dude/dudette explodes in a shower of gibblets. What's more, females undergo a sex-change in the instant before death and land in a heap of distnictly male body parts. Yes Bioware, I can spot that bald head and those bulging forearms.

- Music: Not bad, but not particularly memorable. A few recycled tracks from the first game - which both hurts and benefits the game. Truly neutral on this point.

OTHER THOUGHTS:
Accoridng to Steam I have spent a total of 364 hours on Origins and another 30-something on Awakening. Rest assured that'll never happen with DA2. Providing actual entertainment was clearly the lowest item on the developer's priority list. Where Origins was a work of love and a proper homage to the Baldur's Gate series, DA2 is simply the result of EA pressing Bioware for a quick profit. DA2 is to Origins what Justin Bieber is to Pink Floyd. I'm not buying anything from Bioware that's got Mike Laidlaw at the helm (Sorry to single you out Mike, but if this ship's going down I'm holding the captain responsible).

1.0,False,"01 1, 2010",A5CWLQF6QO3CN,B0015HZLVK,Tso Haven Hei Wan,"Tales of Symphonia on the Cube was classic game that a lot of Cube owners hold close to their hearts. So when Bandai Namco announced the sequel, there were sounds of joy - that is until the game arrives in the store.

Bandai Namco, in a Square-Enix fashion, managed to shred good memories into pieces by changing the battle formula, the main characters, creating time wasting dungeon puzzles and ridiculously hard random enemies.

About the story, it is 2 years after the dawn of the new world after the party in the original game regenerated and reunited the two worlds. However, in good old RPG manner, there were disputes and discrimination in the new world (which they dealt with already with the Desians in the old game) that the world is far from being united. To even make things worst, the original hero Lloyd Irving seemed to have become the biggest villain in this game. When you were thinking ""What the?"" the game introduced the two most annoying main characters in Tales history - Emil and Marta. Emil basically sulk throughout the game and acted like an idiotic coward. Every time he opens his mouth, you just want to fast forward the cut scenes. As for Marta, although she was supposed to have a greater mission, all the things she said in the game seemed to just want to get laid with Emil. It is extremely frustrating when you need to listen to those conversation again and again after each battle without an option to switch of the dialogues at all. Seriously if Bandai Namco wants to pay homage to the original game, might as well just make a sequel with the same cast tell about their after stories. The two main characters are so unlikable that you just couldn't really be bothered to find out what happened to them.

Adding to that was a completely unrewarding battle and party system. The battle system stayed true but now the party only consists of the two main characters with a Pokemon style recruitment system. The thing is if they actually follow the Pokemon or even the Persona formula, it will be a great system. But then it didn't. Monsters fight with you in real time and evolve, but the AI and strategy controls are so limited you basically have no control over them. Unison attacks all look similar with limited variation so you don't really know whether it is a new move until you look at the name of that move. When monster evolved they reduced back to level 1 and lose their skills (which they can acquire later when they level up again). Now cooking became a means to evolve them and increase their stats but then if you already have leveled up monsters it might be best to stay put and just increase their stats instead of evolving them. So eventually it lost the whole purpose of recruiting new monsters because they all join you at level 1 and required substantial ""wait-in-line level up"" before you can deploy them into battles.

Dungeons in Tales of Symphonia are ingenious and yet challenging. In Dawn of the New World, they are just mere existence for extending gameplay without much value adding to the game. You are repeating all the block pushing and button pressing and that's all. So they make it a lot in each dungeon so you can enjoy listening to the same sound effects again and again for two to three hours. Not because they are difficult to solve but they are so large scale that you just need to run around doing similar things again and again. And to make this even more ""challenging"" they have random enemies that can kill all your party in two or three hits. In one of the dungeons, you need to pick up one of the key cards in one of the rooms, but then suddenly they have random enemies that can cause around 700 damage each hit at a point of the game that 3 hits you'll be dead. To make things worse, Bandai Namco took away the easy on the fly character switching system and replaced it with a complicated and user-unfriendly nun-chuck and Wiimote system that you need a PhD to master it freely. So while you are busily trying to heal and revive your characters, you lost control of all your characters instead.

Dawn of the New World has such potential to be a RPG that Wii owners who love the previous Cube game can embrace it whole-heartedly. But changes to the game just make it a very forgettable game that if you are fans of the old game should strictly stay away. Even the cameo appearance of the original cast won't be able to save it cause the game is overrun by level 99 annoying main characters, cheesy dialogue and exhaustive and uninteresting gameplay.","If you can't make a better sequel, don't!",1262304000,11,,

The negative reviewers seemed to mostly go on and on about how complex the game is. ""Sure whatever,"" I thought to myself. ""Those people are just 80-year old grandmas who don't even know anything about video games."" Boy, was I wrong!

First off, let me be clear. I'm a big fan of the first two Lego Star Wars trilogies, plus the Indiano Jones Lego game. I've also played Lego Batman. Those games are AWESOME. My two kids and I love them, especially the Star Wars ones. So with Lego Clone Wars, I hoped we would have just as much fun. But the game isn't fun.

The original Star Wars Lego games are a blast. They are relatively easy. You fight your way through areas, do a few simple puzzles every now and then, and unlock guys. If that's what you are expecting with Clone Wars, let me disavow you of that notion right now!

In this game, they have SERIOUSLY upped the difficulty level. The gameplay mechanics have also been made significantly more complex. The puzzles have all become a lot harder too. Gone is anything easy to figure out. I'm a veteran gamer, and even I was struggle to figure out what to do next in this game, even on the beginning levels!

Also, level objectives are now much more vague. Oftentimes, we couldn't even figure out where we were supposed to go or what we were supposed to do. This has made the game more challenging, but not in a good way. It has made things confusing. I chalk this up to bad game design.

Another thing I don't like is the ""busy-ness"" of the graphics. The other Lego games have clean, simple graphics. Where most of the things you see are made out of Legos. Here, it is not the case. Everything has been replaced with more realistic-looking graphics, like something you might see out of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III or Battlefront. The Lego characters interact in this realistic-looking environment, and the effect is really jarring.

Something else I hate in this game are the bosses. The bosses in the other Star Wars games are relatively easy affairs. Fun to play, especially for kids. Not in this game! The very first boss we fought, it took us about half an hour to beat. In Clone Wars, you don't just fight bosses. You have to do multiple varying things to beat them. The whole time we were playing, I just kept thinking to myself, ""You have GOT to be kidding me!"" I mean, what the heck are we playing here? Ninja Gaiden???

All this may be okay for a teenager. But it is not suitable for little kids at all. There is NO WAY a kid will be able to play these games on their own. You'll have to do everything for them.

I am really disappointed, overall. In an attempt to add depth and complexity to the game, the programmers forgot who the game is for: kids. They may be patting themselves on the back for their cleverness, but I think it stinks.

In conclusion, if your kids are Star Wars freaks and just have to have this game, then by all means, buy it. But it may not be the game you expect. Don't say you haven't been warned!",Disappointing,1338508800,22,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

1.0,False,"01 18, 2012",ATPZCCHCGP01V,B004NRN5DU,Katalizator,"NPCs are a staple of any good RPG. You want to interact with them, talk to them, learn their story and accept their ridiculous quests because they reward you upon return. What you probably don't want to do, assuming they're a crucial part of the story or the only f'ing vendor that sells that one spell in the game is kill them in the face. While there might be some very marginal reward for doing so, like gold or a picture of their newly orphaned children, it's usually not as beneficial as say, letting them give you the dragon sword or slaying the mighty herpes beast. FROM Software has decided this is all crap, and if you happen to, I don't know, set the controller down to refill your scotch and accidentally hit the bumper button in front of the NPC there's a chance you'll upset them, defend yourself, and remove them from the game forever.

But it gets better.

While I managed to unintentionally kill someone that was apparently going to leave / die later anyways, it wasn't a huge deal. However, in the game there are a handful of NPCs you essentially rescue (or kill) from various situations. See, some of these NPCs are extremely important. As in, you'll never be able to cast vital spells or purchase story-based required items if you decide to hack open the barrel they're trapped in like a normal person when you're supposed to actually roll into it to break it (seriously).

I realize there are similar NPC vendors (two or three) throughout the game that sell similar items, but there are some very unique inventories and even if you couldn't get the super fireball from the first guy you slaughtered, the other guy you can buy it from is waiting patiently ... about 25 god damn hours from now in a place that's really hard to reach without the super fireball. Do you see the issue here? If you don't, I'll be happy to email you pictures of the first four controllers I broke with my face.

Range is Better Than Melee. Almost Always.
Some of you might remember games like Oblivion, or Morrowind (which I hated), where you could exploit the range attacks quite well. You know, go buy a few thousand ""Child's Crayon"" arrows and shoot them for two hours into the Lava Dragon Monster Demon Sandwich who wouldn't notice he was getting slowly pelted to death as long as you were more than seven feet from his face.

You can do the exact same thing in Dark Souls.

But that's exploitation, and doesn't mean the game sucks because people figured out they could take advantage of dumb AI and mechanics. Besides, those fireballs and arrows are only good for taking a shot or two at Bald Bull as he charges little Mac. Right?

Wrong.

Not only is the game incredibly cool about you eating through massive creature's health from range, but if they actually notice you, you're better off strafing and firing lightning bolts and stuff instead of ever pulling out a sword.

If you think that's an exaggeration, go ahead and look up every boss in the Dark Souls wiki - careful though, a lot of spoilers there. You'll notice 90% (again, seriously) of the ""Boss Strategies"" involve words like ""range"" and/or ""fireball"" and/or ""arrows"" and/or ""seriously, if you don't have spells or 200 dexterity and a crazy bow made out of baby skulls, you're going to die.""

That's kind of a problem if you have a PHD in snapping necks and a minor in Kinding of Shooting Arrows Barely 101 or the closest you come to casting spells is making fun of LARP videos on YouTube.

Just Go Get the Thing from the Guy and You'll Live Through This
FROM Software thinks that the more vague something is, the more adventure it provides in the search. For example, if you asked for directions to a landmark while hiking beautiful mountains with a loved one, this is a feasible philosophy. But it's nothing like that. It's more like falling out of an exploding airplane without knowing where to find a parachute.

There is actually a part in the game, seriously, where an NPC says something like, and I'm paraphrasing, ""you'll actually die if you go into (spoiler location) without knowing how to traverse it. There's this guy that knew how to traverse it. You should talk to him. Good luck, a-hole.""

Yep. And guess where this ""guy"" is? First of all, it's not a guy. It's an object, and second of all, it's in a location totally f'ing unrelated to anything you've done so far. You'd basically have to go exploring in an arbitrary location far away, fight a boss you may or may not be prepared for (and if you're not, clearly you're in the wrong place, right?) kill it, and get the required object.

I only figured it out because it was a fluke - a total accident. I was so pissed off at the boss I was stuck on I decided to go exploring and killing everything I could. I just kind of stumbled into this and got lucky. I can't imagine how angry I would have been had I found out the hard way.

But that's not all.

There are certain parts in the game that require other items - for example one item is absolutely essentially to even hit the monsters in the area while another is required or you'll stumble through pitch black. I know you're probably laughing and saying to yourself ""while you're brilliant and attractive, Homebrew, it seems like if it's dark you can just go buy a torch or use a Light spell."" Oh really? Who sells torches? Are you sure they exist in the game? Do I have to go attack a tornado and piss on a dragon's face to send him crashing into the roof of the pitch black area so it opens to sunlight? What if I am literally unable to cast spells? Who sells Light? DID I ALREADY F'ING KILL THAT GUY ON ACCIDENT?

I think you get the point. Pretend you're playing Castlevania 2, but remove any semblance of NPC instruction / dialog and make the things you're required to do slightly more obscure and less obvious.

It's not only vague, but you could have possibly ruined yourself and you just won't know it until 40+ hours in the game FROM Software gets your mom pregnant and sends death threats to your grandparents. At least that's what it feels like, considering the investment.

There's Some Grinding Involved
And I say ""some"" the way Keith Richards took ""some"" drugs. I don't care how exceptional your reflexes are. It doesn't matter that you won a Starcraft competition or ""intentionally"" wrote off dating women to win a Ferrari in a Doom tournament. And even if you play on a 90"" TV on your tenth play-through using the Nintendo Power Glove, you're still going to grind your balls off. The game is designed to be reasonable about reaching a boss, but once you get there on occasion you'll have a rude revelation: those monsters on the way to the boss were reasonably easy because you're going to have to kill about five thousand more of them in order to beat the boss.

The only saving grace here is that the game is insanely beautiful, combat is somewhat fun and the death animations are great, so at least you'll be mildly entertained until about Undead Zombie #47,103 dies to your counter-animation #23,558.

FFFFUUUUUUUUUUU

You'll notice that my writing went from structured and informative to sloppy and rant heavy. My sarcasm seemingly went off the charts, and you could probably feel the rage emanating from every other word. There's a reason for that.

That is exactly how this game feels.

At first you'll be in awe and wonder, reveling in the beauty and adventure the world provides. You'll notice a few issues here and there, but nothing soul-crushing (no pun intended). There will be moments of mild annoyance and irritation, and when you inadvertently slaughtered that guy you meant to greet you'll assume the consequences are limited.

Then things will get dirtier. You'll start forgetting where to go, stumble into places you're not sure you're supposed to be, wonder where to buy spells, items, and make stronger weapons. You'll start putting points into stats you're not sure are important, lose a monstrous amount of souls falling off cliffs, and trying to figure out what the hell a covenant actually means and how you gain reputation with one.

Eventually, all of your seemingly innocent ""mistakes"" will catch up to you, you'll be inundated with terms, items, and NPCs that make no sense whatsoever and provide little to no explanation. You'll start wandering aimlessly and failing at different locations you may or may not need to be exploring just for a change of fail scenery.

Then you'll be me.

Installing the game itself and trying to play it for the first time gives you an error message.  It seems as if the 1.10 patch which you are forced to download corrupts your save game.  Since the game creates a save game when it first launches it is an impossible error to avoid.  After patching the game you will be informed that your save game is corrupt and that you must manually exit the game and delete the save game.  Seriously, the game forces you to delete its own save game just to play it for the first time.

While playing this game you will encounter the following:  You will get lock-ups leading to a frozen console.  You will see other players' characters missing weapons.  Most of the servers' ""channels"" will be full and open games will be difficult to find.  You will encounter serious lag during play.  Closer aiming will inexplicably cause your character to stand up.  The menus will respond slowly to your input.

There are other issues with this game beyond the glitches alone.  The graphics are poor for a PS3 title.  The textures are muddy and low resolution.  The game has plain lighting effects which fail to impress.  The blood effects appear to lifted directly from Mortal Kombat.  The control scheme is unnecessarily complicated with poor default mapping.  All buttons on the controller are used and some serve multiple functions based on the duration of a press.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really lead to superior control versus other, similar, games.  It's complex for the sake of complexity.  Features you expect in a modern game such as the ability to join one of your friend's games in progress, player muting, or even something as simple as your own name being highlighted in a long list of party members are absent.  Trophies, which are indicated on the box itself, are nowhere to be found.  They are promised in a future patch.

I'll write briefly about the headset as it's likely that's a main draw in the purchase of this bundle.  There are a couple of minor problems with the device.  The unit itself is quite heavy.  It is by far the bulkiest Bluetooth headset I've used.  You may feel your ear getting fatigued earlier than you'd hope for because of this.  The ear cushion is not adjustable in size so it may flop around in your ear as it dangles from the headset's hook.  The main attraction to be found is the giant mute button in the middle of the device.  Most headsets created  for use with cellular phones have an inconvenient mute function.  You will also receive on-screen notifications when changes are made to the unit such as volume adjustment, the mute toggle, and a battery charge indicator.

SOCOM: Confrontation isn't ready for prime time.  It has far too many show-stopping bugs and feels unpolished in most aspects.  I would stay far away from this game.  The headset is worth a purchase, but the game itself is not.",Avoid this game,1224547200,24,{'Edition:': ' Bundle with Bluetooth Headset'},

The movements are not smooth, the items that they were are so fake looking example: a necklace that one of the archer wears not only it looks like someone forgot to give it some 3d look to it, as the dude moves it doesn't move on him making it look even more ridiculous it looks like he is wearing some paper necklace, now i could care less he is wearing that its to show they did not designed things right.

The Landscape: Once again people from before, Liars!!! I seen Better landscape on Forza 5, CoD Ghost, Cod MW, Need For Speed, Destiny and the list can go on and on.... The land scape on this game is like play Ps3 or Xbox 360 and yes I own those too.

1. Do you like playing games were developers find ways to artificial extend gameplay at the expense of the player?

2. Did you like Majora's Mask?

3. Does the idea of controlling character movement by touch screen seems like a good idea?

If you can answer yes to these question, in particular 1 and 3, then you should give this game a try. If not then you should pass on this game, or at least wait for it to come down in price.

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is actually rather short in length compared to Phantom Hourglass, the only reason it seems longer is because of train travel. The train can only travel on tracks, tracks that a little later in the game are patrolled by demon trains, which forces the player to take longer routes to avoid them. Factor this with the fact that your train, even on the highest speed setting is slow as hell, makes for a very dull and boring experience. Most of your time playing this game will in fact be spent on the train. For this reason alone Spirit Tracks gets 1 star and I would recommend you avoid this game at all cost or if you must, purchase Phantom hourglass.

As for the controls it seems to have gotten worse compared to Phantom Hourglass. Precision in controls, even while controlling the train, and the fact that they changed rolling to two taps of the screen instead of the loop to loop motion can lead to accidental damage or death while playing. This issue however is minor, and one could play this game without being bothered by it too much. If you're the type of person that prefers, or would have preferred the option to use the D-Pad, try the game out before you buy it or just avoid it.

Finally the game itself is not much better than Phantom Hourglass. If you played Phantom Hourglass before, you pretty much already played this game sans trains. Although the conversations between Link and Zelda are cool, and she makes a good side kick, the story is truly no better than Phantom Hourglass. In some respects, it's worse. Spirit Tracks is the Majora's Mask of the DS, so to those of you that didn't care for Majora's Mask shouldn't bother with Spirit Tracks. Otherwise don't be surprised if you experience a lot of ""been there, done that.""

First off, character creation is limited for each character class.  Pretty, disappointing considering this game cost half a billion dollars to develop.  There is 3 looks for the 3 classes.

Secondly, the story is actually really, really short.  And any ""story/universe"" lore that you want to learn or read you can only access via Bungie's website.  Again disappointing.  (Perhaps future DLC, can expand on this miniscule universe that is supposed to be enormous)

Thirdly, the side missions known as ""Strikes"" and ""Raids"", are limited and grow boring after a few runs.

Fourth of all,(something positive) On Xbox One the controls are smooth, the game play is solid and the world's are beautiful.  But feel hollow.  Like a gorgeous frame, with a blank portrait.

This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them. The mini-games must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you don't get any points whatsoever. Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the mini-game. If you're 99% perfect, sorry no points. The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players. If you don't have four players then the computer will take over the rest. Be warned, the computer always wins every single mini game. There's a choice for computer skill...easy, normal, or hard...huh? What is hard skill? Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat? No explanation whatsoever. But, it does not matter, Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computer's amazing flawless skill at mastering the game. The point of the game is to get 20 coins, by absolutely mastering the mini-games as flawlessly as inhumanly possible, then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for 20 coins. Watch out, there's also a space where, if they have 50 coins, other players can steal your star. They should call this game Star Stealers. The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most times...and thus steal everyone else's stars. There's no friendly competition here...it's all about bing underhanded. If you don't have 50 coins to steal a star you can, for zero coins, steal coins from other players. this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best. There's no skill involved to winning the game over all because it's all about who's lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times. One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth, but when you're in fourth you're stuck. Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game. Oh, and don't forget they the shortest version of the game takes 45 minutes minimum. The longest version takes 3+ hours. Ridiculous and frustrating to no end. Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose. No thank you!

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.

But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had.

First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.

Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.

And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.

When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!

It doesn't show a larger version next to the ""teaching"" dancer so I can see myself the same size?  Am I missing something?

I find it unbelievable people think this program is good.  What does this offer compared to just buying a much-less-expensive DVD that shows real dancers, maybe even instructional?

Update: Anyone who thinks this game is great should check out Shape Up for Xbox One.  That program does what I expected Just Dance to do...show the user on the screen!  Shape Up actually shows the user, with background cut out, right in the scene with the trainer, full size.  Heck, it will even show TWO users and put them on each side of the trainer.

The character who is human don't ever eat or use the toilet(as far as i have seen), which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world, and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster(so you would think the reverse would be more likely).

So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an ''accident''  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and don't have personal cleanliness(but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he's hungry he will still end up Numemon). And if your traveling to follow the story, it's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next ''accident'' occurs.

i will not buy or rent any of the next games, because this was such a failure. i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet, then watch him everytime he goes..?

AGVN should review this, i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played. The sims i'll admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally, but it's a longer time in-between bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you don't have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn game.",Worst game ever!,1305331200,,,

L.,"I feel like a real freak for finding Stretch Panic to be one of the most mind-numbing videogames I have ever played after its recieved such critical acclaim. The packaging proclaims that Stretch Panic was voted as the Best and Most Innovative Game of E3. All I can say is it must have been a really slow year for the Electronic Entertainment Expo.
Innovative? Bosh! Sure it has a kooky, crazy premise and artwork but that's about it. The plot such as it is is that Linda, a young girl with tiny stubby legs, a skinny body, and a head the size of a pumpkin must save her 13 vain sisters who have been sucked into limbo. With the help of a magic sentient scarf Linda must purge her sisters of the Demons of Vanity by pinching her way to victory. I love the art style for this game. It's very colorful and kiddish, but the enemies are very creatively and strangely designed. That's where the innovation ends because this has some of the most boring and repetitive gameplay ever.
You start in the Museum of Agony. Then you go to one of four different realms and pinch large-breasted demons with your scarf. For each successful pinch you get a point. Get enough points and you can open the doors the your sisters' individual realms and a boss fight begins. Then you must use your scarfbomb attack to seperate your sister's soul from the Demon of Vanity. After that its just a matter of pinching the demon until it dies. And you'll be doing the exact same thing 13 times. Notice, there isn't any platforming action in between. Well, maybe pinching the demon girls qualifies but that gets old really quick. Add to that less than half of these bosses will put a decent fight, and after the couple hours it takes to beat Stretch Panic, you may have forgotten what it feels like to fire a synapse. Basically the game is all pinching. In fact, most times the only problem you'll have is finding a spot in the enemy's attack pattern where it stays still long enough for the five seconds it takes to use the scarfbomb.
Linda moves with all the speed and agility of a bulldozer so dodging attacks can be a pain. It doesn't help that the battle areas are quite small, and I found it sort of difficult to get used to controlling Linda, her scarf, and the camera at same time.
In conclusion, I found Stretch Panic to get pretty, overly easy, and extremely repitious. The only enemy that I couldn't beat in this game was the Demon of Boredom that hovered over me as I played in a vain effort to feel I like I hadn't just wasted my money.","Scarfbomb, Rinse, Repeat",1100822400,3,,

Putting *any* kind of power-drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble -- I own a lot of expensive electronics and I'd never do it in a million years.

Instead of taking such a chance, go to your local retailer and buy a little fan (4""-6"") designed for placing/clipping (depending on how you've got your Xbox set up) on your desk at work, etc. You can get one for $5-$10 and don't have to worry about leeching power from your 360. Just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top.

Since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill, you can shop for one that's quiet and fits your setup. My 360 actually runs quite cool, although I do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier.

The graphics: Not bad, but certainly not on par with games like No One Lives Forever 2 and Mafia. The game does utilize the Unreal engine and has some nice textures here and there, but the town has a very artificial and claustrophobic feel to it. The NPC textures are o.k., as well, but nowhere near those in Return to Castle Wolfenstein.
The sounds: Very so-so. I found the weapon sounds in particular to be very unrealistic - especially the AR15. (It sounds like an airgun.) In a game where gunplay is an essential part of the fun, this is a glaring flaw.
A.I. - Not nearly good enough to be satisfying in the way the game claims to aspire to. To truly descend into the cellar of bad taste, the NPC's would have to behave in a believable manner, with a certain complexity of interaction available. As it stands, the NPC's have a very limited range of behaviors. This, combined with the so-so graphics makes for a very artificial environment.
Gameplay: Obviously, the creators did not have the funding nor programming talent to make Postal 2 into a game with cutting-edge graphics and groundbreaking gameplay. Even with these limitations, however, the developers could have made the game far more fun with just a little thought into what makes all of us want to go ""postal"". Getting stuck in traffic, having to wait in long lines, getting diss'd by a rude employee - with a little creativity, the programmers could have inserted these scenarios into the game to add fuel to our virtual postal tendencies. As it stands, apart from the postal dude's general psychosis, your player has no real motivation to go wacky - and the A.I. just isn't good enough to make it fun when you do. Without these assets, any open-ended environment - no matter how big - won't keep you coming back for more...

Reddit did a far better job than I could ever do summarizing the ways this game fell short: [...]

Biggies listed there are:
The loss of planetary physics, which were said to govern many different systems, seemingly in a cascading effect from the top down
The retooling of ships to make them all functionally identical, rather than having different classes for different playstyles, essentially homogenizing ship play into a single playstyle
The reworking of factions from something with broader significance, into the very simplistic system we have now
Resource distribution following none of the rules that were spoken of, instead resource variety is more shallow than we'd been lead to believe, so distribution was seemingly homogenized regardless of planet-based factors (likely an effect of the loss of planetary physics)
This also had a knock-on effect for trading, which was trivialized by the ease in which most resources could be found
also crafting, which went from something Sean hoped would be community drive a la Minecraft (likely because there were far more resources originally, a la Minecraft, there's more evidence of this than just the crafting,) to something that could only be done through recipes the game must teach you before you can actually use

Graphically, the game has been upped to 1080p with an impressive removal of jaggies, but that's about it. All the textures are the same, the player models are the same, and the crowds are in poor 3D form.

My brief and I mean very brief 2 weeks stay in this game has left me permanently scarred for life. Second Life can be summed up none better than a paradise for trolls,perverts, and the socially awkward.

Most of SL is about virtual sex as you will see have dressed characters and in game adult themed places and items pretty much everywhere. Even in non adult areas. You simply can't avoid it. Anyone who plays will lie to you and try to sell you the game as a ""virtual"" world where you can sight see and build things but that honestly makes up a small portion of the game. Maybe people did that 8 years ago but today those places are empty.

Second Lifes population has dwindled as people moved on with their lives but all thats really left are the type of people that you would more than likely not wish to be involved with in any life. Desperate housewives that use the game to virtually cheat on their husbands, lunatics that think the game is real and have substituted it for their actual life, Grown adult weirdoes that like to dress up as animals or role play as children (sure might sound innocent but nothing in this game is innocent), sexual predators and the sexually perverted mostly found playing something called Gorean or running around in rape cities, nerdy adults that want to be vampires, and above all else the worst crowd of all needy/clingy people that use Second Life to get a girlfriend or boyfriend because they fail to do so in the real world.

Its hard to play Second life without feeling pathetic or feeling pity for the people that do play it and have been playing it faithfully for years. Then theres the age old tale of My first life is great but they dump at least 80 hours a week into an online game. Give me a break. Youre real life sucks thus why your in SL trying to escape it. The common lie in second life is that its not a game but a virtual world. This will be told to you over and over again by the highly delusional players of second life. Second life IS a GAME. Just a very outdated one thats no longer relevant. Those that still think of it as a virtual world should perhaps actually catch up to modern times and see what other games youve been missing. If I had to sum it up Second Life is like Grand Theft Auto with the creativeness of Little big planet except without the fun and a terrible buggy platform and engine to build on.

Its a sandbox game where you decide what your fun should be. Its still a game and an MMORPG as everyone on there is role-playing. Either role playing that they're attractive as their avatar or role playing that this game doesnt suck. Its a virtual world as much as any MMORPG with a chat interface and zones to explore or any other online game. The only difference with second life is that the developers make RW money off the land players purchase to build their imaginary zones (which cost hundreds of real dollars youll waste).

So is the game good or is it bad? Well? As a game it was probably good maybe 6-8 years ago but it hasn't aged well. It has the graphics of Windows 95, the world is highly glitchy and buggy. Vehicles can hardly be used because so many places don't allow them and their buggy anyway even if you get to use them, the game crashes randomly and constantly, and to top it off the game is highly tolerant of its problems so they're never fixed.

If you enjoy games youve probably already played plenty better than this and ones albeit with saner people. The most normal folks youll encounter in this game are the trolls because the trolls now its a game and are there to get a laugh. Other players? Well they just seem someone lost mentally.

Some might think its harsh for me to say those things but until you venture into this world you wouldnt truly understand. Second Life is just a haven for delusional people with mental problems to bring their problems into a gave where they can live life as normal as they possibly can by pretending to be normal.

I met a guy playing a Furry shemale Wolf/Aligator as they explained to me in their profile. If that alone doesnt make you eyebrows raise than you might be ready to play second life.

It is virtually the same game.  I was willing to overlook some of the flaws of '07, but EA has apparently decided to make this series a cash cow and just keep cranking out the same game every year for more money with no actual development.

'08 suffers from the same randomness as '07.  You can play this game for months and not get any better at it or see your win % increase.  The problem stems from the utter randomness of the passing game.  There is no way to defend against the pass and you are left to just mash buttons and pray.  Sometimes that doesn't even work as your QB will take many sacks thanks to unresponsive controls that fail to pass when you press a button.

Graphic :1/10  - Graphics are low poly, outfits look terrible, in cutscenes gear goes from low poly to high and back and forth
Controls 2/10  -  Tugboats handle better.  there is some nasty input lag and awkward moments when your character refuses to attack.  It's like it is trying to get between two different animations and decides to do neither.
Gameplay 1/10 - Enemy bosses have very cheap mechanics more so than the enemy, often your swings with pass thru targets with no damage because they are pretending to ninja dodge (even with the sword passing thru their torsos (star fox could take a lesson)); also, pointless enemy grind portals, and ""Oh god my arm is on fire so I'll walk really slow"" moments.
Story 0/10 - this is by far the dumbest excuse to murder everything in sight.... hell a store run for milk would of been a better story
Audio 4/10 the music is meh at best, but character (English) voice acting is bad .... and all the enemies are voiced by British
Online Coop - Fun when the servers work (currently don't)
Online PvP - Really cool to level up and pick different looks for your ninja,  gameplay however will not be fun/fair for low level players due to higher leveled players have better weapons and items.

The Long:

This game is a massive embarrassment to the once proud Ninja Gaiden series.  The production values are damn near pre Xbox levels across the board. (lazy port aside) there is no excuse for the low poly count visuals.  The story is all over the place with every past Ninja Gaiden story merged into one for no reason  what so ever (Skip will become your best friend).  The audio is just strange enemy shouts sometimes make no sense and the dialogue does not adjust to your character, so in trials mode if you use any of the female ninja's be ready to be hear enemy looking for a male ninja.  The controls are a mess!  Sometimes they respond and other times they just do whatever and you will get hit ... .a lot!  Camera still hates you and many times in tight spaces you will be fighting 20 guys and the camera at the same time.  So its just safer to always press the dodge button no matter what every 2/3 seconds because there will be a rocket guy spawning very far away to shoot at you.  While I go on about combat I will discuss a MAJOR flaw,  walk 5 ft encounter 30guys, walk 5ft encounter 30 guys, arm goes red ""OH NOES"" transport to another dimension and fight 40 guys come back arm on fire health depleting by the second and walk forward (pointlessly) for a cut scene to unexplainedly cure your condition.  Combat is also droned on by the fact that EVERY ENEMY IS RECYCLED from previous games, nothing new to see or stab/slice here just endless corridors of drab pointless slashing.  OH, dismemberments do happen, but there is no rhyme or reason for it, some mobs take a tons of strong attack combos to dismember them and others one dab will do it.  I will say, I do enjoy the kill animations, it gives me a sac or two to recover from the horrid dodge dodge dodge stab dodge dodge dodge dodge stab combat.  I am currently playing back thru the game on a harder difficulty setting using the different characters to see if anyone else other than Ryu is better per level.

ONLINE - Figured I'd move this out of the main review.  When the online coop did work it was fun. But somehow the game server fell apart and I can no longer join or create a solo/coop mission room.  However, the pvp part still works and happily points earned there carry over to solo/coop mode so my char will be leveled up whenever that mode decides to work again.  PvP combat is fast and confusing, expect the get decimated until you level up and get more powerful gear.  Also modes can change on the fly in game (default 4v4) but every once in awhile it will switch to free for all.... This left me on more than one occasion on the ass end of an ass kicking as I was lvl 11 at the time and others were 25+.  You do have a bunch of stuff to unlock with points earned in the match from health to cosmetic gear.  (Weapon customization adds bonuses to your weapon so don't forget to do it when you unlock them per weapon)

The Xbox 360 comes in two versions: this bare-bones version, and a full-featured version that comes with a hard drive. The bare bones version is a little less expensive at first glance, but is more expensive in the long run.

For example: all games, and any use of Xbox Live, require some kind of memory storage. The bare-bones system does not come with any memory. You *have* to buy it seperately, which eats up 1/2 the price difference between the Core and the full version. Another example: the Core does not have high-def output cables. If you have a Core and you want to actually see the fancy graphics that the Xbox 360 is producing, you have to go out and buy a set of expensive cables--which eats the other half of the cost difference. If you want a wireless controller you have to buy that separately too, and now the Core is more expensive than the full version.

In conclusion: if you want the Xbox 360 experience then buy the full machine, not this crippled ""core"" version.

1.0,False,"05 27, 2013",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B018K6KV68,ChristineMM,"I've come to the conclusion that there are no decent gaming headsets under $100. I add this to the list headsets that are a waste of money.

First, the cord on the headset cannot be plugged into the xBox360 (regular not Elite edition). Turtle Beach advertises that this works with xBox360 and Playstation but those are usually hooked to televisions, and many people own HD TVs now. We have an HD TV so we cannot use this with our TV for console video gaming ""as is"". (A Tritton headset we own comes with the cord able to be used immediately, not this Turtle Beach headset.) After researching this problem I found that non-elite editions of the xBox360 need an adapter cable that you must purchase separately. I shopped for that product and found two non-Microsoft items for sale on Amazon (under $10) but customer reviews stated for both that due to the design and size of the inputs on the non-elite xBox360 adaptations would have to be made using screwdrivers, a hammer, and for one of them, a soldering iron. I read that the Microsoft cable costs $50 but was unable to find it for sale on the Microsoft xBox360 website to confirm. I was hoping for a headset that just plugs in, period. I note that with the HD TV you need both the HDMI cable for the video and the other outlet for the audio, that's the issue. The price of the official Microsoft HDMI dongle is $50 full retail (that adds a lot of cost to the lower price of this Turtle Beach headset.)

Second, These begin to hurt the ears and head after one hour of use.

There is high sound quality which is nice but if they hurt or are not compatible with your TV what good are they? There are other nice sounding headsets on the market.

Our family decided we'd use it with the laptop when watching homeschool lectures, online driving school lessons, listening to music with the laptop while doing other work with the laptop and using for gaming while on the laptop. However after an hour, there is pain, so I can't recommend this headset.

I recommend that you buy a high quality headset and treat it with loving care, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRITTON-Pro-5-1-Surround-Headset-for-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Black/dp/B00B1MVNDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround Headset for Xbox 360 and PS3 - Black</a>. Just spend the money on a high quality item and don't waste your money buying multiple cheaper headsets that you will ditch in search of a decent one.

I rate this product 1 star = I Hate It.

  It is the worst 360 game I've ever played Even with the patch it runs like with crap with stuttering and slowdown. I tried installing it to my HD, but it didn't help. The faces look terrible as well. The dialogue makes me ill. The interface is a direct rip from the PC and is horribly cumbersome to use on the box. The text is small and bleary even in HD.
  I got killed by boars and wolves and maybe some rocks too.

The collectors edition is also terrible. I bought it because I heard you get special codes for collectors edition only weapons. But apparently thats just for the PC version.

To start, the GFX are not on par. Most likely because it was made for PS3 and XB360 and then tweaked for new systems. When the protagonist first appeared I looked at his poorly done face and hair and just thought ""here we go.""

The world may not look bad, it is hard to tell because Mordor is always dark. Seeing things is a pain in the butt. The character takes up a good 1/3rd of the screen unless you sprint. So I have this giant cloak with a little bit to the left. So much of the screen is wasted because they wanted to be so zoomed in for no reason.

In order to see more you have to sprint. This is a bad idea because at any moment you can run into a band of patrolling orcs. So it is basically move to a spot, go wraith to see whats out there, move a little more, repeat. Getting into a fight with 5 or more orcs is not recommended.

Moving into combat. I don't know if they wanted a lose your way to victory type deal or what. They have a pretty neat system in place. If an orc beats you he moves up in rank and may challenge his captain to a duel. If he wins that he moves up higher. Problem is they almost always beat you. If it were one on one it may be different. However every time, every single time I face a named orc two to three more show up. So now there are three of them and it only takes two hits for you to die. There was a certain orc that, no matter where I was on the map, would show up when I engaged a named and he would always show up when my health was low. Being able to execute a stunned enemy is nice when you can use it. However if there is more than one orc it is not worth trying. You can get through the part of the animation where you stab the orc in the heart and neck, but the other guy will knock you off before you can slit the throat and that's a no go for death. The orc will just get back up and come at you. The animation takes way too long. If they were going to carbon copy AC they could have at least got combat right.

Like most games the camera just straight sucks. There isn't a more straight forward way to convey that. I was fighting a named orc, right before my buddy showed up, and we were not even on the screen. I was looking at a rock and a shrub while we fought some where below. Try to move the camera a little and it will zoom in that direction. Try to maneuver it to see enemies and it will just move all around you like a drunk mosquito.

Another annoyance worth mentioning are the cut scenes when a named orc joins the fight. which i was getting 2 to three times per. The screen zooming into a face saying ""I could smell your blood from blah blah blah..."" can really have an effect on what you were doing. Cut scene ends and oh by the way you were countering but took you finger off the button. Opps your dead.

It's a horrible game. There is no other way to put it. WB just tried to mash a bunch of ""been there done that"" mechanics into a LotR game in hopes they could grab multiple audiences. They even went as far as to give the main guy a broken sword that is almost identical to Narsil. They wanted him to portray Aragorn it seems.

Money has been really tight lately, and I really need this guys. I'm going through some hard times, and despite that my titles are going to be more than under par with what I've already been giving you lately, I just wanted to ask all of you if you will still buy my titles for me. I really need the money, and you know I wouldn't ask you this unless I was really tight for money. Would this be alright with all of you? It's just a couple million, and you know I'll pay you back. I love you guys. You've been great.

If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.

This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:

You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.  OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink, but she has a change of heart and drug it instead.  You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator, but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war.  OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying, the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town, and put an end to it, and he has proof. So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.

This is nonlinear plotline, the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game, even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero.  Assume the hero died in the thief story, the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl, and her adventures.",Hate nonlinear plots... hate em hate em hate em (unless they're done right),1125532800,,,

I ripped open the envelope it came in and pulled out a small bag with a Micro USB controller, the Titan One, and a page of 'quick start' instructions. Those instructions are rather useless. Anyway, I excitedly went to my computer to get it up and running. And after trying for two days, I couldn't get it to work. The first roadblock was that I couldn't even download the GTuner software that the device requires. I could only download it after I turned off my Norton Antivirus because, for some reason, Norton decided to recognize it as a 'dangerous' program. I have no clue why. Aside from it being Norton. After I got it downloaded, I quickly checked out the instructions in the program's digital manual, followed them, and attempted to use my PS3 controller on my PC. Didn't work. I tried it again, same result. I re-read the instructions and then tried it again. Nothing. I downloaded the plug-in Max Remapper, created the profile, loaded it onto the device, still nothing. I then checked the forums, dug through post after post of people who got theirs to work properly and felt more than a bit jealous of them, because I still couldn't get it to work, and as far as I know, I'm not doing anything wrong. I checked YouTube videos, followed what they did in their video instructions and nothing worked. Maybe I'm dumb, but I generally know how to follow directions.

BAD: DRM nightmare. LAN play crippled. BattleNet is a huge pain, but you have to use it.  Can't play in different time zones. Can't spawn. Internet connection required. Paying customers treated like criminals. GREEEEED: it's only actually 1/3 of the game.  Look forward to the whole game costing you $180 (not for any special editions either).

Blizzard has likely hammered home the final nail in its coffin as a studio that ""gets it"".  What a huge difference between this and the original--and definitely NOT in a good way.  I pay for games.  I do not advocate piracy.  So why then, do pirates get a superior product?  Yes, the cracked version is already available all over the place, and that version lacks what makes this product so distasteful.

Having been a huge fan of the first game, I was bitterly disappointed that this one is so crippled, as well as being incomplete.  There comes a point where the bottom line of profit is directly impacted by one's reputation.  Blizzard took a running jump over it this time.  They went from one of the most respected studios on the planet to an entity that makes EA and Apple look positively enlightened by comparison.  To be fair, it is perhaps Activision that is to blame, but most folks will not take that into consideration.

Piracy is here to stay, as long as there are people who simply refuse to pay $60 for a computer game.  Thus far, no one has produced any DRM capable of stopping it (or even significantly reducing it).  The DRM does do a fine job of annoying the paying customers though. Why studios fail to see this is beyond me.  I suppose whoever builds DRM solutions has a really good sales team. Meanwhile, those who pirate the game get a better version than the one we pay for.

Luckily for Blizzard, the anticipation for this game was so frenzied that they will do quite well, I'm sure.  Millions have already purchased it.  I'm just wondering how many returns they will get.  They'll get one from me, that's all I can say for certain.  It will also be interesting to see how well they do selling the second and third parts, as well as any future games.  My guess is that they won't get quite the numbers they expect, unless changes are made.

Statistics have proven time and again that having even the most draconian DRM does nothing to reduce piracy, and that those who release a game without it somehow manage to do just fine (if it's a good game).  Some studios have learned this lesson.  Mass Effect 2 is a good example.  I happily purchased that game, after passing on the first one due to its DRM.

The hard drive is not nearly as effective at storing information as normal memory cards; in fact, it often decided to erase my save files on a whim. I have never had this problem with a PS2 or GameCube.

But this problem pales in comparison to the paltry game lineup. Let's face the facts: Unless your gaming palate consists entirely of generic action games, licensed garbage, and ""edgy"", ""adult"" titles, you will be bored out of your mind with this thing. Oh sure, it purports to have ""RPGs"" in the form of trash like Fable, Jade Empire, and KOTOR, but these are just more generic action games dressed up in RPG clothing.

Oh, and news flash: Pretty graphics can only numb your brain to the pain of mangled game design for so long. Once you wake from the ""Ooooh it looks so good"" stupor, you will realize that you are wasting your time.

As for me, I found one single game that was halfway decent on this console, and even then, it was a game that also appeared on other systems. And still worse, halfway through it the XBox erased my data. Yippee.

You are basically forced to learn how to write and read it as well, even if you have no interest at all for it. Why? Because this thing won't let you go on without beating the level and to do that you have to pass the reading and writing sections for it.

This game has a horrible teaching style. What it does is show you a character. Now you have to press the correct English world for it. You can know the English meaning without knowing the actual Chinese word, which then this game fails. What the game should do is, put up a Picture of the item you're looking at and you now think of what that word is in Chinese.

With the writing part, you get to see how they write a character and the animation is so fast that you may sometimes don't know how they wrote that because it was so fast! Then, you don't really know if you wrote it correct because the game doesn't know for sure if you did or not. It sometimes think you wrote it correct and something think you didn't, so it's not accurate.

I find the match the pitch wave length test useless. The speaker is female and I'm a male. I have a natural lower tone voice than her and so my pitch wave will always be different than what she said, but I am saying the same thing. Many people will have different pitch but can say the same tone in any character. So, that feature is pretty useless and not needed at all.

This is NOT a good thing and while PACMAN is one of the games that will NEVER be forgotten the ""Classic NES Series"" doesn't capture it in all its glory.  PACMAN was a nice classic Arcade game. I wouldn't consider the NES version to be a classic in anyway.  There are a few things that stand out as to why.
The gameplay isn't bad. You're PACMAN in a maze eating up little yellow pelts.  The Big Pelts give you the chance to capture the ghost.
But as I said some things are just wrong.  For example, the Arcade version was a stretched out screen with the score at the top.  This version shows the score off to the far right and tries to hard to fit it into the screen.  You'll notice that PACMAN, the fruit and the ghost are all bigger than the corridor of the maze.
PACMAN also suffers from what many other Classic NES games suffer from and this one has it bad.  For one ITS BEEN RE-RELEASED SEVERAL TIMES!

*  The iron sights are way to close to the avatar's eyes and thus unrealistic looking. This is one reason I disliked Bad Company 2 so much.  Operation Flash Point got it right way back in the early 1990s so why can't newer FPSs?

*  Spawn killing is common place.

*  Unlike in CoD4, all advancements are always superior to the default, so that the players who play allot have both superior weapons as well as experience.

*  No prone and no leaning (campers could be better handled by having them appear on the enemy's radar after a set time and by having them take auto damage after a longer set time). No leaning seems to be a lame surrender to consol gamers. I don't play consol games as I find most users of them to be too immature.  PC gamers tend to be my own age which is why I used to love MP PC games.  But nowadays they are the same.

*  There is apparently a newer version out but EA provides no information on how to download it.  Going to the suggested site just displays allot of advertising to encourage people to buy the game.  This is standard of all EA games and has always ticked me off.  Starcraft II's $60 price tag was justified by their solid initial game and their automatic patching.  EA games should stick to $50 until they offer similar quality on initial releases and patching support.

*  ARMA II is a superior MilSim and CoD4 is a superior run n' gun.  This game is not a good medium between them but a failure.

*  The tips tend to show a lack of military advice; they state that smoke grenades provide good cover for example.  They don't.  They provide concealment, and in the game they are too brief to offer even much of that when your team is getting spawn killed non-stop.",Multiplayer Review,1287014400,21,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I've got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it. And Midway makes really great games.(LOL) And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin. This is truly a lucky day for me.""
Until I played it....

Then as time went on, I kept it in my basement, and then one day I decided to bring it out because I hadn't played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves. So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again. Then I remembered why I put it the basement. What I should have done was bury it in the back yard, never to see the light of day again.
As soon as the first round said ""FIGHT"" I might as well thrown in the towel. The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was 99.9% dead anyway, I mean, what the F is the point?!

I don't even think the skill level even works.
The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro, (he's your best bet.)
If you play as Motaro you will get your a** handed to you literally! (Pun intended).  The A.I. actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen! But if you were to uppercut the A.I. Motaro, he only staggers, can't have him flying into the air, oh no, that would require fairness in the game.

MK has been known for the copy and paste routine on characters, and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it. The male and female ninjas, and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at Wal-Mart and calling them cyborg ninjas, you know this is a cheap a** game. What the hell was this game made off of, a 50$ budget? I guess Wal-Mart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale.

If the Matrix was to take a glitchy $***, I'm sure that it would look something like this. For every time it loads a match, I can actually hear my PS one groaning like it was trying to pass a cinder block.
If that PS could talk it'd say, ""Oh lord... please... help me!"" :(...

I can see now why it was in five dollar bin, but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it, and if I knew then before I bought it, I would have said; ""Hey, this is in the wrong bin.""

Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordan's big fat head keeps popping out saying ""Toasty."" I wouldn't be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen pop-out of the corner and say; ""Already got your money dude.""

And when it says on the back of the game. ""Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death."" That's you, your the opponent. The A.I. will make sure of that.

As for brutalities, who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes? Wow. I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before. Apparently Ed or any of the designers of this pile of $*#& game, doesn't know a damn thing about the human anatomy. Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves, now this?

To sum it up.
The game play was awful.
The A.I. is cheap.
Glitchy as hell.
They copy and paste the characters as they always do.
The option menu is useless.
The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato.
The audio is awful.

Looking back on my teenager days where I was young, dumb, full of ***,  and didn't know any better, I was easily manipulated into crap like this. So of course I would defend games that I didn't know anything about. Of course I would deny that I've been taken advantage of.  And now we see the same types of teens that are doing this all over again. They'll read this review and say, ""Oh how dare you talk that way about MK! Even thou I didn't grow up with it... bla, bla, bla."" I doubt that any one of them ever played this game on a PS 1. They'd argue that they'd played it of off their iphone or somethin', and say it's the same thing. NO! By then, the bugs have been fixed and it's NOT THE SAME. YOU'RE PLAYING IT FROM A PHONE! It has to be from a P...S...1! Hell to them they'd considered it a retro game. They can't judge a game accurately that wasn't in their childhood. All they can do is look at it from a future point of view. As for us 80's babies, we grew up with this crap. It's only right that we judge it from OUR timeline, no one else's.  And it's hard even to this day, to let go of something that, even thou I've been scammed by marketing-ploys by some cheap broken product, I grew up with them. But ultimately, you have to say to yourself, that I've been had and it's time to let go.

I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless you enjoy yelling at your TV screen all night, then look no further.
But if you care about your sanity, and want to keep it intact. Then stay the hell away from this thing!  You'll find no entertainment from it. And that's where it fails, it fails at what the main purpose of this game was made for, ENTERTAINMENT!

I'm talking about the glitchy kind of bugs, more than just polygon clipping or walking off a cliff when you didn't press anything. Sure those are here too but that isn't new to Tomb Raider. This is the first video game outside of a PC that I've needed to download a patch for!

Eidos if you don't know how to make video games maybe you shouldn't.

The graphics are as good as expected on the Wii I wasn't disappointed there but I was disappointed to learn all the new features like shooting from ledges and melee combat are gone from the Wii version. When they say exclusive Wii content they mean exclusive lack of Wii content.

There are almost no enemies in this game and your health bar refills instead of finding med-packs. This was done to make the game easier no doubt because the controls suck. They take a while to get used to.

The levels are much much smaller on the Wii you won't even recognize this game if you've played it before elsewhere. I can understand the simple graphics and getting rid of the little spiders, but it didn't need to be this watered down.

I'm not a Tomb Raider fanatic I only bought this game after falling in love with Tomb Raider Legend. The two games are nothing alike sadly. Legend's fast pace has been replaced by the stop and go puzzle formula of old Tomb Raider. I rarely have something to shoot, you don't pick outfits for Lara anymore, you can't walk around your mansion between missions, and there's no level select function only four little game saves.

If you like Tomb Raider Legends this sequel will be a let down. If you love Tomb Raider regardless please buy it for another system. This was a sloppily made Wii game and it will do nothing but disappoint you.",You need to know the truth.,1266019200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I played Rome Total War and medieval total war for well over 1000 hours over a span of several years.  The quest for the quick dollar and corporate quarterly statements has ravaged this once great franchise.

Ever since the purchase of Empire, I have felt this game slipping away.  This was probably my last shot as well.  I apparently didn't learn my lesson with my Shogun 2 experience.

The graphics are good, even stunning at times.  But the game lacks the depth that I desire from the Total War name.  Whereas previous versions would allow you to cultivate relationships with other leaders, or see your family tree, or plan to move your troops in the summer or winter, this game has lost all of that.  Some battles in precious games could last a substantial amount of time, these don't have that same feeling.

It's hard for me to say what they could change.  It seems that this is how games are done today.  But what does it mean when people say that Rome Total War, or Medieval Total War 2 are better than this game?  When Civ 4 is better than Civ 5.

It seems that games today are developed for console kids.  Those that have their parents buy them a game, they beat it, and it sits on the shelf.  It's throwaway.  I still play my old Total War game, because they are fun and engaging.  This was a waste of money.

1.0,False,"11 6, 2002",A2WEVTFVH6D94T,B00006IZKO,Amazon Customer,"Wow, what a let down.  I was looking forward to this game for a couple of reasons.
1.  I love the books
2.  I love 3rd person action/adventure games
3.  Surreal had something to do with it, and I loved Drakan, the Ancients gate (which this engine obviously shares a lot in common with.....well, except for most of the good parts.)
Where to start on this turkey.....
A:  Graphics.  Very very similar looking to Drakan the Ancients Gate, but no where near the size/depth of the environments in that game.  The game looks passable, and that's the most favorable word I can use, but the maps/environments are very very small for the most part, and you are more or less on a very narrow *track*.  The graphics in general have a sort of cartoony, empty feel.  The game lacks much mood from a visual standpoint, and that's a shame given the source.
B:  Gameplay.  1 word...horrible.  All the problems that plague bad 3rd person adventure games are here.  Camera panning/orientation is one of the worst I've played in a long time, which again is a real shock, as Drakan the Ancients gate is one of the best in that regard I've ever played.  Weapon selection (not that there is much/any) is clumsy, and it's a real problem when using Gandalf especially, not that it matters much as the fighting is so simplistic.  In short, just about everything that can be annoying about control issues in games like this, is.  I really don't understand what happened, as the engine is obviously by and large the same one used in Drakan, and it's fantastic in that game.  Perhaps this game had a different team of people, or was actually in development before Drakan was.
Whatever the problem is, it sure is lousy.
On top of those two things, the gameplay being the major flaw, the game is shockingly short.  I finnished this game in 5 hours, with no cheats, no online help, no guides, it's laughably short/easy.  Also, the game just feels thrown together.  The cut scenes seem very rushed...it's hard to describe this unless you play it, but it really seems very thrown together.
In summary.  I wouldn't buy this game, and I have a hard time even recommending that you rent it.  I'm not sure it's even worth the 6 bucks or whatever your local rental place charges.
Avoid at all cost....what a shame, such potential to make a truly great game, and from (at least in part) a company that has made a fantastic game with more or less the same engine.  If your looking for a good 3rd person action/adventure that you may not have played, check out Drakan the Ancients Gate.  It's a much much better game than this, in every way possible.","What a horrible game, such a shame.....",1036540800,2,,

However, the write speed on this thing is absolutely offensive for the price.  I transfered a 750 MB video file from my computer to my Vita, and it took around 7 minutes.  This means that this card will write at 1.79MB per second.  However, a 64GB SD card that costs $25 on Amazon has write speeds of up to 48MB per second.  A $51 micro SD card on Amazon has a write speed of 80MB/second.

This means that there is a piece of technology that is very similar to this, which costs 25% of the price, and is over 24 times faster.  If you are willing to pay half the price of this memory card on a Micro SD, that Micro SD card will be more than 40 times faster than the Vita memory card.

The reason I bought ""Grid"" was that it had garnered enough reviews on Metacritic to earn the place of the most favorably-reviewed racing game for the Playstation.  After having played it for weeks I wonder how many hours those reviewers actually played it.

For me, at least, the thing was unwinnable.  It was so difficult as to be ridiculous, even on ""Basic"" difficulty.  I like to come home from work and want to unwind for an hour or so with a racing game.  This seemed as good as any other, but after a few weeks passed, I noticed that I wasn't making any progress in the game, since I wasn't winning any races.

This is because:

1.  All the camera angles are so low that you can't really see much of the road ahead of you.  Therefore to avoid crashing you are forced to travel at speeds slower than those necessary to win even the simplest races.  As a result, the only way to really win a race is, essentially, to memorize the track.  But this strikes me as boring and not unlike memorizing maze patterns in Pac-Man.

2.  The physics of the game are completely absurd.  Since when do cars invariably and eternally speed out of control because you floor it when you're on grass or gravel?  I have a car and do that from time to time:  my car does not spin in absurd circles when I do.  The physics of the game and the interaction with other cars was all convincing and realistic until you got off the track.  When you did, Bizarro World rules suddenly same into play.

I think this is clearly shown in the contents of this game, most of which consists of shameless self-worship by Ferrari, but little else.  Certainly not a playable or enjoyable game.

I'm a huge fan of Ferrari:  the kind of irrational, annoying fan you don't want to get into a conversation with.  (E.g., I've been to the Ferrari factory in Maranello.)

But this game caused a lot of confusion for me:  how did it pass Ferrari's quality inspection?

If you drive around Italy, you won't see a bunch of Ferrari stuff all over the place:  stickers, magnets, t-shirts.  Oh, no.  That stuff's carefully controlled by Ferrari:  they're very jealous of their brand image.  Sure, you can pick up a bunch of Ferrari kitsch, but only at authorized retail outlets, such as the Ferrari gift shop in the Venice airport.

And while the junk you can buy at such pre-approved venues (e.g., pens, mousepads, keychains, etc.) is of little interest to me, you've got to admit, it's high-quality stuff.  Ferrari doesn't want its carefully nurtured brand name tarnished by a bunch of cheap junk.

But, having said that, how could they have authorized this game to be released!?  It's pure crud!  Man.  Thank God for places that let you rent video games before you buy them (wish I had availed myself of one).

Get a whiff of the several problems with this one:

1.  Steering feels all wrong.  I happen to own a Ferrari and it handles much better than the cars in this video game.  True, mine is one of the Kyosho Ferraris, but still.  The action of the car seems to come entirely from the nose, as if you don't have any back wheels at all.

2.  Did you ever dream of being able to drive a Ferrari?  Would be nice, wouldn't it?  But you have to admit that it'd be kinda dumb if everybody else in the world had Ferraris too.  That's exactly what happens in this video game.  Everybody has Ferraris.  It's not like some of the drivers have Porsches and Lamborghinis, no.  You're just gonna be staring at Ferraris until even the most ardent fan is sick of them.

3.  A related problem:  since every other driver has a car just like yours (or better), and since they never make mistakes (e.g., taking corners too wide), there's no way for you to win races.  This game is far too difficult.

4.  You can't crash your car!  I find this more than a little absurd.  You can hit a solid wall at a jillion miles an hour and your car won't accordion, or even flip.  Rather, it'll look like it's just been waxed.  I guess Ferrari didn't want people with visual memories of scratched-up Ferraris?

5.  This game should have been called ""Pininfarina,"" since Pininfarina designs the bodies of Ferrari, whereas the Ferrari company only designs the engine and the chassis.  I say this because pretty much the only virtue of this game is staring at the back ends of those beautiful cars.  But Ferrari didn't even make those!

6.  But even that isn't so great in context, since the game designers didn't seem to put much effort or attention into much else:  graphics, variety, etc.  There are other games (e.g., X-Box's Forza Motorsport 3, or GT5) where you can drive a Ferrari that at least feels convincing in the context of a game that is worthy.  Nothing approaching that experience is to be had here.

7.  Unlikely you'll be able to drive your favorite Ferrari in this game.  Find a list somewhere and you'll see that the Ferraris included in this game are not popular favorites such as anything in the 308 or 328 series, but instead racing workhorses such as the F348 and several clones of it.  When they released this game, the gamemakers reportedly promised there'd be ""50 cars"" available to unlock or download.  Unsurprisingly, given the slip-shoddiness of this game, they haven't even come close to delivering on that promise.  Disloyalty to fans.

I won't waist my time and yours repeating what has already been said.  But yes Blizzard makes you jump through many hoops and then tightens the hoops around your neck.  They treat the paying public like criminals who buy their products and who made their company.  I have a comment about that, ""don't bite the hand that feeds you.""  The large price for a game that is only 1/3 complete with only the terrain part of the game, and the fact that you have to be connected to the internet to play the game, to get any more maps, and to get your game saves/stats, etc.  Also, you can never reset your account it is the same for life unless you pay for another copy of the game, plus you can only play with people in your region, period.  And yes, one must be connected to the internet to play the full installed version of the game.  If you are not connected the game does not have full features.  AND every 4 weeks you must connect to your online account or your game will shut down, and that's for the life of the game.  Also, the Blizzard server saves and compiles data and all your stats from the game whether you want it or not; and it stays as part of your account for the life of your game and you can not change or reset it without buying another copy of the game.  Also, for small extra online addons here and there you will pay and pay again if you want them.

All this sounds great huh?  This is borderline criminal if not criminal.  It is apparent that this industry needs to be caught up to modern times with some form of regulation.  The consumer needs privacy and protection from this kind of crap.  Phone companies can not listen in on your calls just because they made the phone, and car companies can not track you and tell you to drive the car to their home office every month so they can make sure you are doing the right thing with the car.

I think its best to stay away from this game and this company.  I will not ever buy anymore of their so called products.  And they are now releasing Diablo 3 that will be just like this.  Don't make me laugh.

I enjoy it so much I decided to add a second account and thought I'd purchase the Special Edition assuming that the extra items would be worth the additional cost. I must say that I was very disappointed.

It is obvious that they (Midway) tried to copy WoW's Collector's Edition, which is a nice and worthwhile special edition, but Midway did it completely on the cheap.

The Map of Middle Earth that is included is all but useless and printed on very cheap lightweight paper.

The ""exclusive in-game item"" you get is only useful (+1 hope) at very low levels if at all and takes a full hour before it can be used again.

The soundtrack CD is a real pain! It includes the narration from the game's cut screens so you have to hit ""skip"" on you CD player almost every other track if you don't want to hear all the game narration over and over. Why didn't they just put the songs on CD like WoW did on their collector's edition? It would have been MUCH better.

The DVD on how the game was made is OK but nothing special.

The back of the box also says... ""EXCLUSIVE! FULL COLOR SPECIAL EDITION MANUAL"". Translation, it's the same paper manual you get in the regular game but some of the pictures are in color... woot! If you were thinking beautiful color hardback book like in WoW's collector's edition think again.

All in all great game, but don't bother to spend the extra money on a ""Special Edition"" copy of the game, just get the regular and have a great time.

Hopefully when Midway releases its next expansion later this year it will be more of a class act.","Game is great fun but ""Special Edition"" (collector's edition) not worth the money",1209513600,12,,

2) Grouping -- There is no grouping with your friends unless you're on the same servers and then it's hit and miss. This is the biggest flaw of the game. I don't want to randomly join other people. I want to play with my friends.
3) Laggy -- Not always, but I hate when the screen crawls and something runs up and bashes my brains in.

For PC, they really don't seem to care. Any pair of PC headsets I've bought from them breaks and has to be sent back at least three times before the year warranty is up. The cause of the breakings is the same as everyone else; above the earcup, or just bad quality parts in general. My brother had to send his back 5 times, and the side panel on his computer case is covered in Turtle Beach stickers that came with the headset (Turtle Beach always sent brand new headsets and never the original one). We had a contest going to see who could get the most stickers by the end of the year, and he won by 2.

My brother's never actually broke physically, but always had problems with the dongle not connecting all the way which caused cut-outs in the sound or would never stay connected, or the speakers themselves would stop working if he did a sound test. My breaks were always physical. On the bright side, we have 8 sets of splitters which are actually more useful. We also never abused the headsets in any way shape or form since they cost nearly $100 and we like taking care of our things.

It's a little sad because these headsets sounded great and would have been awesome if they could last longer than a month at a time. The amount of speakers caused them to be on the heavy side which made them hard to wear for long periods of time, but that doesn't matter because they'll slide off when the plastic gives up. After this experience I've found out it's better to go with stereo headsets and use simulated 5.1 or 7.1 sound; they're lighter and have less chances of going wrong, and it sounds just as good (this obviously depends on your intended audio use). Also, depending on the brand, they won't break before you can even consider them used. I'm never buying Turtle Beach again after this experience.",Just Bad,1359504000,,,

If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.

Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.

All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.

To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????

As far as graphics go.  It is the best looking One game I've played.  Everything looks so crisp and clean.  Reminds me of Knack.  The voice work is well done as are the cut scenes.  I am having fun playing the game.

That being said, there are some things that annoy me and kind of make me wish I had waited until I could get this for, say $29.99.  First, while things do look great, so many times I have gotten lost.  Not just running around, but while fighting.  Every single thing in this game blends together.  There will be five guys fighting me and they all get lost in the background.  It gets annoying.  The camera always feels off.  It is like I am to far away or not on the right angle.  I can not think of another way to explain it.  As easy as it is to move around, the fighting can get annoying.  I mean, I go to hit and hit a button that makes the guy hit his weapon and shield together.  I will go to fight another enemy and just stand there facing nothing.  It seems that at times, the controls just do not respond.  As far as the story goes, I have no clue what is going on.  I listen, it just isn't important.  I guess that is the reason.  Plus, something that seems to haunt every Xbox One game, the load times.  After like the fifth time I've died and had to sit there for like 60 seconds, I just do not care about it anymore.  The time it takes for the actual game to start is even worse.

Update.
Ok, I finished the game.  It was very simple.  Hit, guard, hit, guard.  That was it.  You can upgrade.  Well, once you get points, you can buy the upgrades.  They go to level 4.  They seem to want you to spend money to upgrade.  I think it is $3.99 for the points or something.  I am not one who likes paying for stuff in a game.  So after I finished the game, instead of selling it as I was going to and since I am getting my new Mac Pro next month, thus not really wanting to start a new game since I will be spending all my time learning how to use that thing, I decided to play to unlock the last two things I needed.  I got the points fast.  I realized I can do special attacks by hitting buttons.  I had forgotten about that.  You see a skull above an enemy and you hit R1.  Then you see them turn a color and hit the controller button that is that color.  Simple.  Plus, I can try to get the hidden stuff.  What it is for I have no clue.  But it is something to do.  Plus, I can get more points on my gamertag by doing more stuff.  The problem I am having now is that the game is SUPER buggy.  Once, there were enemies standing across the way on the side of a building.  I went to hit them with my spear (throw it at them) and the camera just went crazy and looked down.  Stopping me from being able to see them.  Other times I will go to break a pot.  You get points for doing that as well.  I will hit the thing and it does not break.  After like a minute of me hitting, it breaks.  This did not happen the first time.  But it is so buggy now.  It actually makes it almost not worth playing again.  But, I will.  That is all.

Update 2:
I was playing this again to get the points.  I hate this game.  I switched from a 3 to a 1.  So glitchy.  My guy looks like he took some kind of drugs and is twitching all over the screen.  Then, after the scene is done, the guy goes and does all the animation again, without the sound.  I am SO sick of watching the same cut scenes over and over again.  I 100% hate this game.

1.0,True,"02 16, 2010",AP6ZR3DA2IR78,B001NX6GBK,Stephanus,"Dante's Inferno is one of my favorite classical pieces of literature.  Because of its classic nature, I expect classic treatment.  I can see where many of the monsters based on the seven sins were given a modern treatment; it is certainly a well used inspiration for art, photography and the like.  If I were to design the game, I would have given it a more classic treatment, much like Gustav Dore'.  Nonetheless, the game has some interesting visual aspects, and to be clear, are very adult in nature.  This is no child's game.  It deals with Hell and all the deadly sins, and the vision of Hell with all of its trapped souls, mutilated, burned, crushed, and so on is certainly a vision to behold.  The visual aspect of the game I enjoyed.

Why do I not like this game?  Perhaps, I was expecting too much.  First of all, in my opinion, it is a total rip of God of War.  Game play is everything, and to be candid, there were no surprises.  After several levels, it began to become repetitive, and after dispatching the attacking minions of Hell, it all became too easy.  Once you figure out how to absolve or punish them, it all became too easy.  There is a lot of jumping and leaping around, and as the title of this review says, jumping again. Then came the puzzles, which required excruciating timing, and that aspect of it began to become extraordinarily boring.

I have been playing games since 1981, I even worked at ATARI circa 1982, I also teach Game Project Management, Game Design and Software Development at the college I teach at.  A message to all of the Game Designers out there:  making something intensely complex and extremely difficult which requires the ability to get your character to accomplish tasks in a specific order with microsecond timing IS NOT GAME PLAY; it is a clear indication to me that since you could not make game play more interesting, well, let's just make it difficult and painful in place of logic, level design, characterization.  A colleague of mine says that if a game is too difficult to play, we should get our money back.  I would love to see the Developers of this game try to get out of Purgatorio with their kind of game logic.  The game is also very short.  Dante's Inferno is rich in history, allegory, characterization, such incredible and truly horrific creatures, and we can finish the game all in a matter of ten hours?  Part of the issue of game play is, is it replayable?  Dante's work is the kind of literature that requires not just reading, but re-reading to fully understand what is going on.  What we get is a High School outline from this game, or dare I say a graphic novel treatment?  This is why I have come to hate it: from my point of view, Dante is given short shrift, and is more an exploitation than  exploration of his work.

Well, I got through it, but I cannot recommend it, and I can't ask for my money back.  However, I can save you the trouble.  For me, it is ALL about gameplay, story, characterization, logic, level design.  No matter how visually stunning a game (or movie for that matter) may be, it has to be interesting, challenging (but not painfully so).  (P.S. - I have the same problem with Avatar).

As part of the game, there is supposed to be some free downloadable content in March, but I won't be downloading it, and I won't be playing it.  There is a trend with some games that require you to download new content for a price.  Look, I already paid about $60 for this puppy, then I have to download more content?  What does this indicate to me?  That the story is incomplete, that the game is incomplete, and it SHOWS.

I cannot recommend this game.  Save your money, and if you need a vision of Hell, read the book; it will be more entertaining and significantly more interesting.","Total Rip of God of War, Jumping & Leaping and Jumping (again)",1266278400,34,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I wasted a perfectly good giftcard on this puddle of cow vomit because of the fact I saw Square on the cover.  I envision, at Square-Enix headquarters, there is a little room in the basement where the company meets its ""hire the handicapped"" quota.  They spake unto them and said, ""Hark!  I speaketh to thee and bade thee...maketh an RPG!"" and the retards made an RPG and Square saw that it was crap...and that it was bad.  Then Square spoke and said, ""Oh ye of little mental aptitude...I thanketh thee for thine efforts...however, now I must smother thou with a pillow."" and Square smothered the handicapped with a pillow...but not until a few escaped into the battle mechanics room of the Final Fantasy series.

The graphics are vile, the characters two-dimensional, and the combat is something right out of one of those little AA games in the plastic armor hanging on a pegboard shelf in K-Mart.  A rusty Tin Man who's had his joints welded together and eyes riveted shut could move with more fluidity than the sprites in this piece of crap.  Also, the game leaves you with a realization of what a storyline is, since you're so busy LOOKING and WAITING for one to develop within this game.

I viewed this game as a metophorical giant loog wad of yak-spit right in my suck-hole.  Seriously...Square...FOR SHAME!  This game is the equivalent of my PS2 powering on and then nipple-twisting me until I bleed and finishing up with a swift kick to the crotch.

I hate this game more than I hate getting an eyelash stuck in my eyeball...more than when you sit down on a dark leather or vinyl seat in the summer and the nuclear heat sears the skin on the small of your back and back of your knees...I hate this game more than when you go on a water ride at a theme park and your underwear chafe your taint (the area between the crotch and butt).

Seriously, I had a colonoscopy about four years ago and I had to drink this oily lemon-lime stuff that made me squirt clear liquid and wasn't allowed to eat anything for 24 hours so that it felt like my stomach was eating itself and I wanted to die.  Well...this game wasn't quite THAT bad but at least with the colonoscopy I knew it was going to be a horrible experience.  This is a VIDEO GAME.  Dance all happy and free while you put it in the system thinking, ""Another AWESOME RPG from Squaresoft!!!"" and then suddenly you're doing the video game equivalent of gagging down a gallon of Quaker State with lime and squirting clear liquid from your o-ring.

You think I'm kidding?  Do you KNOW where this game disk of mine is right now?  A landfill.  LANDFILL!  Know why?  Because I THREW IT AWAY!  I was moving and consolidating some boxes and THERE IT WAS on the bottom of a box...staring at me.  I looked around...thought about it...and tossed that piece of twice-tossed monkey dung right in the freaking trash.  Did I want the $3 credit from the gamestore?  NOPE!  I refused to subject any other human being, decent or indecent, to the vile putridity of this shiny circular turd.  I feel guilty that I didn't snap the disk in half first for fear some homeless kid living outside the dump and stealing electricity from a storage shed's power outlet might find this game and try it.

(Note: I debated heavily between spending my $60 on Unity or Dragon Age which comes out 1 week later and decided on Unity).

Intermittently drops out during play when used in hardware mode. Not portable in the sense that you can config it on hardware, put it on any computer, *and expect it to perform reliably during play.* It's not a gaming mouse, if it doesn't perform reliably. Also incredibly frustrating is the extra third click button's incredibly low tactile feedback compared to the other two. it's mushy and inaudible, and feels the way your mouse would click if you'd been gumming it up on your desk for 2 years already.

Update:
Now using only the offboard profiles.
The software has been very buggy and sometimes completely ignores my user-set lighting settings (static obviously) in favor of running its little crazy pulsing breathing color-cycling demo mode. Very annoying and distracting esp in the dark.

The tilt-switches (left-right/forward-back) on the scroll-wheel don't have consistent tactile feedback between left and right so one of them you have to push a little harder than the other. Kinda distracting.

The 12-key has every button labeled something like ""G9"" through ""G17"" to represent ""1"" through ""9"". Yes, 1 is G9 and 9 is G17. Logitech are total idiots and this is the sad result of overbranding.

The 12-key is a little soft, chunky, and *wobbly,* hard to tell if you're over the right button and reduces overall stability of your grip on the mouse while you're activating. Something a bit more rigid and *not totally loose in its housing* would be more ideal for fast-paced precision gaming, which again, this mouse does not fit the bill for. It is nowhere near the quality a pro or even weekend FPS player would be looking for.

Update 2: Wow, I still can't stop the lights on this thing from pulsing when they decide randomly they want to do that. I verify the config is set to all effects off. If I don't want distracting pulses I have to kill the lights entirely. Boy am I tired of throwing money away on garbage. This mouse just lost a core feature, because it's unusably f annoying.

I pre-ordered the original ""base"" game because of how much I loved Halo.  I was mildly disappointed with the poor content, horrible story, and extremely buggy PvP and PvE.  Yet, I persevered as I believed Bungie when they said they would improve the game and add more content.  It turns out that the additional content meant spending money on expansion packs.  When the Dark Below was released, I was no longer able to do as much as I did before it was released.  I couldn't do the dailies and weeklies anymore.  I was locked out of some of them because they were ""expansion only.""  So after a $60 initial layout for the game, I paid another $35 for the next 2 expansion packs.  The Dark Below expansion pack added a good raid but it wasn't as good as the Vault of Glass.  Also, it didn't add another planet, just rehashed destinations on the planets already in the base game.  The added story was also very measly.  Then House of Wolves was released but there was no raid.  The story was a little better and the Prison of Elders was initially fun but it too disappointed for the money.  After $95, I still felt that I wasn't getting my money's worth.  The only fun in the game was doing the raid with my friends.  But doing 2 raids is not worth $95.  I put in a lot of hours waiting for Bungie to fix server issues, network issues, horrible glitches, imbalanced weapons, and other faulty programming as they promised to fix it.  They did but it came in the form of the Taken King expansion pack.  Without this expansion pack, the game is pretty much useless.  In other words, the people that were loyal to Bungie and gave them $95 have been burned for being loyal because the game is now unplayable for them unless they lay out another $40.  So after $95, I could no longer do the dailies, weeklies, or even earn legendary marks so I can get new equipment.  Why are they taking things away that you've already paid for?

I'm not asking that Bungie give expansion packs for free.  They deserve to get additional pay for their additional work.  I'm just saying that they shouldn't take away content I already paid for.  Expansion packs should be additions; not add something but take something else way.  They should also focus on fixing bugs before working on new content.  The game was fun at first, but they ruin it each time they release an ""expansion"" pack.  For those that just got into Destiny and have the Taken King, you'll have fun initially...until the next release and then you'll get angry at what Bungie will take away from you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  At least, it's a beautiful looking game.  The music is good too.

As for the contents in the box, the disc is only the base game.  All DLC's are in codes that must be downloaded.  And with Bungie's servers, this can take quite a long time so be prepared for 20 - 40 hrs of downloading before you can play.  Bungie should've included all 3 DLC's on a second disc.  So if you don't like it, you can't get much of your money back cause you can only sell the base game, which is worthless without the expansion packs.  The Taken King story may be good.  But, getting to light level 320 can only be achieved by grinding with raids and even then it's not guaranteed.  And they made the light level worse cause it's now based on all of your gear.  Why should your primary weapon's damage be reduced because your heavy weapon's light level is low?  Now you have rare(blue) gear that's more powerful than legendaries(purple) and even exotics(yellow).

Are the controls an unavoidable result of its conversion from PC to console?  Probably not - plenty of other games have been ported and have still been wonderfully playable.

The cars are way too hard to handle as well.  You don't get much if as boost for drift, or, as the game is designed, you don't always get your boost for destroying things. They(cars)look soo silly, and no matter how many times to hit a person, or you get hit, there's no damage.

The stunts areas, the ones where you can throw your driver out of the car, is terrible!  It looks like it would be very bloody, but there's not a single drop of the beautiful red stuff!  And once again you have to be complete perfect to get enough points to even get into the top 5.

The demolition areas are a royal pain.  Unlike other games where the cars disappear so they aren't in the way, all the damage stays...ALL OF IT!  So you can blow youself out on a dead car.  And if you're doing too well, all the other players will do is attack you, and you alone!

I CAN NOT BELIEVE that Warner Brothers turned the excellent story and task heavy Arkham Asylum and Arkham City games into a tedious exercise in driving with a joystick.

The Arkham Knight story starts right where Arkham City left off. Your new main adversary is Scarecrow and you're immediately thrown into a terrifying encounter at the start of the game that seems to prime you for a Batman game that lives up to its predecessors. About 15 or so minutes in your asked to Even the Odds against a few foes by calling in...you guessed it...The Batmobile. The first encounter with the Batmobile seems fun at first, but that changes rapidly when it becomes clear that said Batmobile becomes a major, if not the primary, focus of the game.

I would not have minded if the game required you to occasionally, as in once or twice, utilize the Batmobile to progress through the story. But no. Turns out that the Batmobile is essential to many tasks in order to maneuver through the city and advance to the next checkpoint. Not a bad thing for someone who's used to driving games. But if you're a story driven gamer like me versus a gamer that likes to drive (pun intended), your possibly in for what can be a monotonous and sometimes difficult progression through the game.

Two story driven games come to mind where the developers inserted unnecessary driving tasks: One was Resistance Fall of Man where you had to drive the jeep; I hated that part and it took down what was otherwise one of the PS3's first and best story driven games. The other was Dead Space where you had to shoot the cannons at the incoming meteors; okay shooting meteors isn't driving but same concept of deviating from a normal progression through the story to an arcade-like exercise in tedium.

1.0,True,"07 13, 2015",A2WLVNKZUWNG4G,B00IQCRKQ6,Sabster,"EDIT (7/26/15): I have now downgraded the original, broken version of the game from 2 stars to 1 star for one specific reason: there is a game-breaking glitch in New Game Plus that renders the remainder of the game unplayable. This glitch is actually, for once, not on the PC version alone; it has appeared on the consoles, as well. There is a section of the game where Batman needs to get onto Founder's Island, but first must destroy the defense grid. This requires blinding a drone that hovers above radar - however, since it's New Game Plus, you have already beaten the original game and thus, have all of the tech toys at hand. Therefore, I had already destroyed this drone prior to this scripted sequence. The problem? If the drone is already destroyed, it cannot be blinded, and Batman is locked into a tiny area with invisible walls, no way to glide off the roof, and no access to any of his gadgets except the remote hacker/sequencer. Great job, Rocksteady! I've played through the frustrating original campaign, with its pale-imitation-of-previous-games freeflow combat, and am now stuck on New Game Plus, with no way to proceed. What an utter failure this game is, in virtually every capacity.

(Original Review) I am an avid fan of the Arkham series of games. Asylum was, when I played it, the best game Id ever played. City expanded on Asylum, making soaring and swooping and taking out baddies as fun as it could be. Origins was essentially a City clone, but I was okay with that, given how much I enjoyed City.

The myriad problems of Arkham Knight on PC are well documented. Im not going to get into the issues with framerate drop, because fortunately, I have not experienced them. The game is smooth and playable for me. However, that does not mean the game itself is without other problems. It is, and they are enormous. Rocksteady, in particular, should be ashamed of releasing a game not only in this poor state, but with other flaws that make it a frustrating and, at times, infuriating experience. As for WB? Well, is anyone even remotely surprised when a MAJOR corporation puts making as much money as quickly as possible over any sort of quality? I spit on them (metaphorically) for this release, but it makes no difference.

Perhaps the greatest issue I have with the game is the hand-to-hand combat. In previous Arkham games, it was smooth, with Batman flowing seamlessly from one target to another, and allowing you to seamlessly integrate all of the various combat techniques and gadgets. In Knight, the combat is a pale imitator of what came before. I don't know if these problems are related to the game not being ready, or if this was how its creators intended it. Evasion is nowhere near as responsive as it should be. I hit the appropriate keys, and oftentimes, Batman doesnt move. Second, the free flow combat will occasionally juststop. Batman will not strike, and the consecutive hits counter simply disappear. It completely takes you out of the game. Next, the quickfire gadgets don't always respond like they should. Youll hit the button, but nothing will happen. Even more egregious is how Batman will occasionally hit the wrong targets. In previous games, I could rotate the screen to point at the next guy I wanted to hit. Well, in this one, that doesnt work. Batman will try to punch a Brute, or a guy with a shield, rather than the intended target. Even using the movement keys to guide Batman doesnt always work. Ive also encountered failures with countering attacks. Ill hit the counter button, yet Batman gets whacked, and the free flow vanishes. Finally, the ground-and-pound finishing move only works haphazardly. Ill watch as Batman goes through the animation, the thudding knockout sound is audibleyet the dude that just got crunched gets up.

Another major issue is the gadget you currently have highlighted is stuck in Batmans hand upon exiting the Batmobile. The animation is stuck in the preparing to use phase, and it won't put the gadget away. Sometimes, after firing the gadget, it will go back to normal  at other times, I have to restart. Ive also come across an issue where Batman is interrogating one of Riddlers henchmen, only to have both of them get hit by a car, randomly. The camera freezes on the car, and thats that. Restart time!

The final issue I have is the key mapping. The key mapping in this game flat-out sucks. Many of the combat finishing moves are mapped, by default, to a combination of keys that require using alt. How stupid is it to expect a gamer to press multiple keys to engage in a combat maneuver in a fast-paced, quick-reaction type of game like this? Remapping helps, but it shouldnt happen in the first place. This also leads me to the Batmobile.

The key mapping for the Batmobile is also terrible.  The combat usually consists of moving out of the way of pre-determined attack lines. There are several types of attacks available, but the problem is trying to effectively do everything you can to avoid getting hit, firing your weapon, charging up secondary weapons, etc. At later stages of the game, it becomes ridiculously difficult to manage this with a mouse and keyboard, when the game starts lobbing helicopters, tanks, missile launchers, etc. at you. You also get thrust into tighter spaces to make dodging more difficult. It's not fun. It's a chore.

Also, how in the heck do those armored APCs manage to speed so far ahead of the Batmobile, and round sharp bends so tightly without toppling over? Yeesh.

My final gripe involves the pre-order discs. Because I loved the previous games so much, I pre-ordered this from Amazon. When I got it and installed it from the discs, it only had about 7 gigabytes of the 34 required to play the game on the actual discs. The remainder had to be downloaded  because of the wonderful, non-competition in this supposed capitalist country, I am stuck with a regional monopoly of a telecomm company that provides slow internet speeds for exorbitant prices. Therefore, I had to spend 4 consecutive days downloading the rest of the game before I could even play it. Brilliant.

Needless to say, Im disgusted. Everything thats good about the game has been utterly wiped out by its flaws. Hopefully, they get it fixed, but for me, it will be too late  the game already has sealed its reputation with me. Ill play through it to completion (I bought it, its going to get done), but I think Ill revisit Arkham Asylum and Arkham City if I ever want to play an Arkham game again.","For shame, Rocksteady and WB.",1436745600,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Downloaded the game on and off for a few days.
Was unable to do anything because I needed to run it in compatibility mode.

1.0,False,"12 8, 2008",AXJL59IQ8QW9P,B0017Q4DGI,Aaron D. Fridley,"My grading scale with Wii Games looks like this ...

5 star = A must play. No improvements need to be made. Has replay value (this is very important). I do not give out 5 star reviews open-heartedly. I consider any game worth playing, and owning is a 4 star game (which is my way of saying its 5 stars). Im very strict on 5 stars.

4 star = Even if its my favorite game for the Wii, I will hand out 4 stars to it cause I can view some improvements to be made. OR it does not have replay value (meaning I played it once, I loved it but Im not gonna play it again). Either way, it was a game I would prefer over its competition / genre. I like to give any great game 4 stars just so I can leave some room for a potential 5 star future improvement of the game.

3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)

2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.

1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.

And now we can continue with the actual review for Wii Sports ... First of all, I am a 24 year old male. I am not happy seeing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this game. Its as if no other games were played therefore the reviewers had nothing to compare the game to. I can understand that as Wii Sports comes with a new Nintendo Wii. This is not a hot launch title like Super Mario 64 was for the N64. In no way should this game have the same review rating as Super Mario 64. I would give this game a 1.5 as it is 5 games in one but ratings need to be lowered! As to not fool anybody out there that this is a hot product, because it is NOT. I am one that relies on Amazon reviews for a lot of the products I buy. So I do not want to be misinformed. People who purchase the Nintendo Wii spend their time playing hot titles like Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Resident Evil 4, Mariokart Wii, etc. THIS GAME, ""Wii Sports"" can be seen left in its packaging unopened by a Wii owner. If I could sell this game I'd be happy. If you purchase a Wii that does not have Wii Sports, please purchase a different game. As I'm sure you can always borrow this from a friend. In fact, they may very well give it to you. I would.

So lets look at this game ... The title of this review is ""too much intrinsic ratings"". What I mean by this is the high ratings are given to this game because it has a strong relationship with the Nintendo Wii console. Nintendo Wii is of great success (and even having this Wii Sports game included with it, I would still offer 5 stars to Nintendo Wii). But this individual game needs to be reviewed for the game that it is. And not a psychological view that 1) it is mutual with the Nintendo Wii (dont want to give a bad review to the game that piggybacks with a remarkable console), or 2) it is often the first game played on the Nintendo Wii. In fact being the most handed out game (how often are hand outs considered popular?) this game has only received less than 20 reviews. Maybe its because hardcore gamers have no interest in this game, or never bothered to play it. As I had no intention playing this game when I purchased my first Nintendo Wii.

So lets look at what it offers ... these are all short games. Nothing competitive, or innovative. An introduction as other reviewers have mentioned. This is more like a demo. Or a tutorial for the real version of the games. And is very PONGY.

Baseball ... only 3 innings. Cant play defense. Use no thought. You just pitch, and bat. While the computer plays the fielders. No double plays can be made, no pick-offs. I consider it an 80's baseball version of pong. It is very simplicit. What I mean by this is when you hit the ball, as soon as the fielder touches it, it will tell you whether you received a single, a double, or a triple. Can you imagine playing a baseball game on an 80's computer? Where it tells you what happens. Yes, like that. You don't tell the runners where to go or have ANY interaction with the fielders. Its very basic. Pitch the ball by swinging down. Then hit the ball by swinging across. And thats IT. Let the computer take care of the rest. No buttons need to be pushed in this game.

Tennis ... this game reminded me when I was in Las Vegas. I played a game called ""Ace Tennis"" on one of those virtual game touch-screen machines at a bar. Again, its very simple, just swing the remote at the right time. Doesnt take any thought. The ball seems to always go over the net and land in the same spot everytime. You can do this with your eyes closed. And not to mention but when playing single player, you play on a team of two. I played best out of 5 games, and best out of 3 games, the player on my team NEVER hit the ball. He was just a stand in, I did all the work. The same was true on the opponents team, he just slid back and forth along the net, didn't do anything unless I hit a slow one just over the net. And he'll finally pong it back to me. I literally spent 5 minutes going back and forth with the tennis ball. Just same ol same ol. Opponent doesnt make mistakes (he did once though I'll admit so consider it rare).

Boxing ... first day I got my Wii (I had no other games) I couldn't sleep that night. So I got up at 1:30am. Didnt have anything to do at the computer so I played Wii Sports. I had played Wii Sports for over an hour earlier that day to get used to the game. It was kind of fun at first cause you're learning the game and wondering if this really is that 4+ star game!! ... so I get up at 1:30am and I really didn't want to play it but I had no choice lol. I searched through the game TRYING to find a reason to like it but I couldnt. Boxing is probably my favorite sport here. I spent an hour boxing. It gets harder after each fight you win. Eventually after an hour you get frustrated cause you cant get any punches through and it tires you out. The controls are a little tricky too. Punches I wanted to do would rarely register (the low or side punches). You can literally win rounds with nothing but high punches (which is keeping the remotes in front of your head and swinging down as if you're beating a drum). That simple. But the only reason I liked the boxing is cause it was a nice workout for the arms. After an hour you will feel a light sweat, become a little tired, you feel the blood pumping through your arm. So boxing is something I can consider apart of a workout plan. But there could be a much better option like Wii Fit, or a more in-depth boxing game like Facebreaker for example. In fact the mini games on Rayman Raving Rabbids gave me a better workout when I was beating a drum listening to a song. It made me move my body as I rhythm'd to the beat.

Golf ... frustrating. I'm not a golf fan myself. This isn't Tiger Woods here, you cant customize, or play in competitive championships. Im sure Carnival games: MiniGolf is a much better option. Brings you more into the game. This golf here is very basic. You hit the ball in the hole, try to make par, and then you do it again lol. Very ""pong-y""

Bowling ... bowling was hard for me. I didn't really master it. I had fun when I first played. Though having been without a game console for 6 months I was quite eager to play a Nintendo Wii again so I was thrilled no matter what I played =)

And that sums up my review. This is a very PONGY game, as in basic / beginner / tutorial / demo. Its not your top of the line sport game here. I really hope this isn't viewed as a remarkable game for the Wii. I think the future of gaming has yet to come, Nintendo Wii being apart of that future and this game is just not it. Its pong. And you sure don't want to spend $30? on this game. Wow. I think the market is overpriced on that. Especially with so many in production it will greatly drop in value with time. I personally might play this game again. As I mentioned, boxing is a light workout. And Tennis is a virtual game I played at a bar having some drinks. So I wouldnt mind re-living that memory. And thats about it. Dont give yourself high expectations for this game coming from an adult perspective. For your child, they'll find more fun to it but still better alternatives for them ===",Very PONGY game. Too many intrinsic ratings!,1228694400,10,,

I have several friends who have problems even connecting to the EA server, and when they do it lasts about 5 minutes before being randomly disconnected.  I have had problems staying with a connection for more than about 30 minutes.  I have been both host and client, so it is not the other persons connection, it is not my connection....it is EA.  Next there is the fact you need a special code to engage in Extraction mode, which is similiar to Horde mode in Gears.  Nice job EA, take a lousy game and exclude some people from engaging in what may be the only decent mode in the game.  Next there is the Campaign Continue.  It is already difficult to find people to play with, but if you try to continue where you left off, and want to play with a random (non friends list) player....good luck.  The only way for someone to find you is for them to choose to start at the exact same checkpoint that you are attempting to start from.  Oh, and another thing (maybe some people would not care), the achievements are BUNK.  Example 1, a 50 pt achievement for playing all 16 rounds of Extraction Mode (which is extremely time consuming, but worse yet EXTRACTION IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL PLAYERS!), there is also the case (which has just affected me), where you complete the entire game on the hardest difficulty (contractor) and do not get the achievment for it.  I can only assume I did not get it because at one point someone did join my game at Normal Difficulty for 2 chapters (while I stayed on Contractor).  I will go back and play chapters 4/5 and see if that gives it to me, but nonetheless, what a pain.

All this and I have not even gotten to the clunky controls, the fact that you try to revive your partner and end up rolling past him, or sprinting past him.  The fact enemies often Phantom Spawm from places you cleared out or checked is also great.  Better yet, you try and spring up to cover and end up flying over it completely exposed and dead in less than 5 seconds.

1.0,False,"05 21, 2008",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00168ESPI,Tsanche,"There is only one word to describe Deca Sports.  Terrible.  And disturbingly enough, one issue makes it stand out as being worse than it actually is over a couple of other issues that aren't even as glaring.  If you thought Deca Sports was going to be another Wii Sports, you were wrong.  The end result is a game that wasn't even close to doing the things Wii Sports did right.

If there was anything Deca Sports did better than Wii Sports it's that they put more games into the compilation.  Some that are a little strange to see, but other wise, it's more than just five games.  Deca Sports gives you ten.  Some are fine to include.  Such as Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball.  Even Archery doesn't feel out of place.  Not everything seems like it fits into place (Figure Skating?) but at the very least, you're still getting a lot of fun games.  Unfortunately, it takes very few tips from Nintendo in terms of the controls.

There's nothing too intuitive about the control scheme.  Most of them are fairly simple, but the first big mistake about Deca is the simple fact that some of the controls make you do two things.  In basketball, for example, wagging the Wii Remote doesn't just make you shoot.  It also makes you pass.  This means you might find yourself passing the ball when you really wanted to shoot.  So you've got some pretty loose controls.  But the bigger problem is that the controls are unresponsive in several instances.  Much of the lack of fun comes from the fact that the controls don't always respond.  This isn't just every once and a while.  This is often.

But the truth is, most of the games just aren't that interesting or fun to play.  The lack of responsive controls can make multiplayer a drag.  But the lack of any sort of challenge can make playing the actual game a drag.  Most of the AI is pretty bad.  Usually not even giving you much competition.  Even in Wii Sports the computer seemed to do something when you played against them.  Despite some unresponsive controls from time to time, you still have a good shot of beating the AI.  Because they spend a lot of time not even trying.  Sometimes even doing nothing at all.

There are a couple of minor issues surrounding Deca Sports.  The first being that you can't use your Miis.  Even though a lot of the characters in the game actually look like Miis.

The saddest part about Deca Sports is that the game could've easily been a good game.  A lot of the ideas for some of the sports aren't bad, but the game overall just feels unfinished.  That, and the simple fact that it just can't compare to Wii Sports.  Deca Sports has some games that are actually good for a sports compilation if you change up a few controls in some of them and just make the controls work.  Games like Archery and Volleyball aren't half bad in terms of ideas for another compilation.

In the end, Deca Sports feels like a game that was made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the success of the Wii and the phenomenon of Wii Sports.  Unfortunately, it's mini games don't play as well and they're not nearly as fun as some of Wii Sports best games.  Save your money.  Wii Sports is still a better choice.

1.0,False,"02 6, 2013",A3FBRTPTOH03CQ,B0050SZBP6,Nick Olson,"A number of important things to understand about the current state of WoW:

-Beginning with the last expansion pack (Cataclysm) the games quality took a MAJOR nosedive. What I mean is, the expansions themselves became half the size of their predecessors, allowing players only 5 instead of 10 more levels and accelerating the rate of content releases to negate the fact that players would plow through things twice as fast now and start complaining about nothing to do. This issue has doubled down in Mists of Pandaria and now the cut scenes look so stupid you'd think they belong in a kids movie done by pixar. Lots of fast, cheap, easy content and no more of the time and effort based content. In the minds of most players, the Lich King(final boss of Wrath of the Lich King, lvl 80 expansion) is still a bigger boss than Deathwing, the final boss in the Cataclysm lvl 85 expansion that came after it. Why? Because the Lich king took time and effort, the dungeon was gorgeous and clearly took effort to produce. None of that exists anymore. Just more content for the wood chipper. Most dedicated raiders only play WoW after new content addition now, unsubscribing once they plow through it in just a couple weeks time and run out of stuff to do again.

-It is still rated T for Teen but the atmosphere of the game has deteriorated to E for Everyone at best. It's goofy, it's cartoony, and it's borderline racist with all the Asian-blend themes. The one thousandth time you hear a squinty panda NPC with a straw hat say ""White Tiger watch over you"", in a painfully Asian accent it starts to get old.

-This game has largely become about the plethora of distractions available, and not about the combat or games actual mechanics, which are largely left on the proverbial back-burner while they focus more efforts on their pokemon-style pet battle system or improve their new Farmville-style mechanic. Yes you get a farm to tend to and grow crops for cooking and trading/selling in Mists of Pandaria. No I am not joking. Sadly.

-PvP has gotten so far out of hand that to join in anywhere in the game but at the launch of new expansion pack is basically a wasted effort. Ranked arena/battlegrounds belong to those who were prepared at the beginning and got that early head start. The next patch claims to address these issues, but the notes themselves translate into something more like an even bigger clusterf__k than exists in-game now.

-PvE content at the lowest level ('Looking for Raid' group-finder tool)has painfully broken mechanics for a number of classes. Players being rewarded loot that they can't use or already have left and right, and nothing but negligence from Blizzard who has yet to even admit that there is a problem much less address it. The raids themselves are about as unoriginal and repetitive as raids get. Theres a definitive lack or originality in the content and now all faction reputations are based off of daily quest grinds, meaning if you want exalted, you now get to do a plethora of daily quests every day. This was so repetitive that they had to go back and implement an item you can purchase when your half way done grinding (revered level) that will double the reputation reward for quests for the last half of reputation you'll still need to grind out with daily quests.

In general, as someone who played this game during its initial release, before any expansion packs came out and through each expansion pack that did come out, I can say that there is an unmistakable loss of quality in the game in the last expansion pack before MOP, and more than doubly so in MOP. I mean, watching the initial cinematic for WoW then watching the new MoP cinematic, it's almost not the same game. Die hard players of the game almost want to weep for what Blizzard has done to the gem that WoW once was. It's on Par with what Lucas/Spielberg did to Indiana Jones with the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It really has become the unilateral rape of a once good and respectable game and franchise.

WoW is now just a cash cow for Blizzard to rake in monthly sub fees through. It's not in...any...not in even the slightest notion worth paying such a monthly fee for. It's so far from original that the entire expansion borders on racist and shallow themes and the entire motivational direction of Blizzard seems to amount to presenting the players with more distracting nonsense that gets old in 5 minutes instead of correcting the mess no one asked them to make.

It's all just band-aids for bullet wounds now. They're constantly trying to patch up whatever wound is hemorrhaging the most players this patch but they have come to the point where there game delivers about as well as a submarine with screen doors. They hide behind patches full of half-assed content so no one stops to point out what a bad job they have done with the actual, core aspects of the game like combat mechanics. Except everyone is complaining anyway.

God, another important and frustrating thing. For like the last 3 expansions WoW has completely rewritten the entire player talent-trees and the way stat points are allocated. By now..It's such a tragic mess. there's no more talent trees and everything is such an imbalanced mess that entire classes have their entire rotations and specs completely rewritten with each new patch and the new abilities they added in MOP...just.. if you thought they half-assed cataclysm's new abilities for classes, you haven't seen nothin yet. Seriously. They shouldn't have even bothered. Every class I used to enjoy has been rewritten with rotations or mechanics that completely kill anything I enjoyed about them.

I've played a lot of MMORPGS over the years. WoW meant the most to me out of all of them, without a shadow of a doubt. But the current state of the game all but spells out that their current goal is to milk the cash cow for all it is worth while Blizzard and Activision put all of their attention and resources into their new 'Project Titan', which I rather suspect will not even make ripples compared to the waves WoW made when it splash landed on the market. Simply because Blizzard has lost so much credibility that much of it's player base no longer feels any loyalty to them as a company and will instantly abandon them as soon as something as addictive as the old WoW presents itself through a new company somewhere else.

If you're looking for an MMO that'll be worth your time, you may be waiting for Elder Scrolls Online. More of the generic medieval MMO business, but the company in charge of that has a slightly better reputation than Blizzard has had in recent years when it comes to player attentiveness and making games that please more people than they upset. Beyond that, Guild Wars 2 is semi new, due for new content at the end of February and free to play.

Another option is The Secret World, Funcom is restructuring so the game has been a bit slow on new content and pvp is in the throws of a massive overhaul, next patch is slated to further that agenda considerably..But most attractive about this game is that its an MMO with zombies, werewolves, a mature rating, dark creepyness and no subscription fee. The monologues in this game are unparalleled in even Hollywood these days. Personally this is where my devotion has been lately as even with the occasional glitches and the pvp imbalances that exist in game at the moment, The Secret World just ooooozes originality and innovative gameplay. There's more originality per sq foot in that game than there is in the last 2 WoW expansion packs combined. You get guns, magic, melee weapons, auxiliary weapons like a chainsaw or rocket launcher (soon the whip once the next content patch is out).

There's also Star Wars: The Old Republic which, if i have anything to say about, it is that they deserve an award for their 'Huttball' pvp mode. There is nothing like it in any other game, and the pve content is quite a bit of fun, so if you want to play a Republic trooper, a bounty hunter a jedi or a sith (single blade, dual weild, double blade) you may want to give that game a go.

TERA Online just went free to play as well. If you want a very visually pretty game with lots of elves that have just the most...massive, gorgeous, gravity-defying boobs ever. But hey, it's a South Korean MMO, what do you expect? Have you seen anime? Decent game though, unique and fun combat.

All good things, all without a monthly subscription.

Point in case:
WoW is dead, and they're still charging you by the month for it after buying the game and all 4 expansion packs for it. I suggest saving your monthly sub fee and getting a different MMO. There is nothing but wasted time and money to be had in Pandaria and they are so busy covering up their failures with new content that it's a waste of time to bother putting in any effort at all. The next expansion pack will probably even be released this year if not very early 2014.

Sorry to go on so long.. I know it was really long, but there is a LOT to take into consideration before shelling out for a game, 4 expansions for it, and a $15 monthly fee.",Review of a player who is done after nearly a decade of devotion,1360108800,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Despite the poor reviews this game got from pretty much everywhere, the concept seemed sound. The mostly positive reviews here on Amazon gave me some hope as well. It is supposed to be an action packed cover third person shooter a la Gears of War. It is supposed to poke fun at video games--kind of a Scary Movie for the video game afincianados. What we got instead is one of the most repetitive frustrating experiences I have ever had with a video game on my PS3. First off, I did not finish this game. Not for lack of trying. There is a part that is in the dark where there is a sniper and endlessly respawning enemies(who will sometimes spawn BEHIND you) I believe it is the end of chapter 3 of this crap. I died there about 20 times. So I figured maybe the difficulty level(set on the medium Major Hazard difficult level) was too high. There is no way to change the difficulty mid level so I replayed the entire level on easy. Again I am in the dark with the damn sniper and respawning enemies. Again I get killing 10 times!!! At this point, I pulled the disk out of the drive and broke it into 10 pieces!! What about this level did the game designer find to be fun? What is fun about respawning enemies in the dark?

Turok and Call of Duty 4(both of which I did finish) and Ninja Gaiden Sigma(Which I did not as my Six Axis probably cannot survive another throw through the window. At least Ninja Gaiden never pretended ot be a game for everyone--it is a difficult game which only a few really hardcore gamers have ever finished. There is another part of the game where you are a on a sniper rifle.. Fun right? What is more fun that popping a bad guy's head with a sniper rifle. BTW, there is no violence at ALL in this shooter. No blood--no gore and the bodies of your enemies disappear even before they hit the floor! Okay but sniping is still fun right even without gore(as evidenced with Turok) Wrong. This is arcade style sniping. Kill 20 guys in about a minute!! Uh developers? That is not fun. Just frustrating!! Ugghhh. I hate this game.

I've listed the top offending errors below:

(1) Environmental errors: There was a section in the first level where I moved behind a fence. I came to the end of the fence but couldn't move past it, even though nothing was blocking my path. I had to loop all the way back and go around. This is a pretty basic error, and yet quality testing missed it - not a good sign.

(2) Enemy detection errors: I was fighting a slew of enemies on the second level and before I could advance further, I had to eliminate all the ground troops. There was one left on my radar and I flew down to find he was....under the concrete. Yes, this enemy somehow fell UNDER THE CONCRETE. I had to reset and start the level all over again.

(3) Poor targeting system: The only way I could shoot a target is if the crosshairs were centered on an enemy at that specific moment. That means if Iron Man was running, flying, or dodging, it's pretty likely that my laser blasts or missiles would miss the target.

(4) Hyper-sensitive flight system: The flight controls operate on a hair trigger. If I pressed the hover button too hard, Iron Man shot straight up. If I pressed the hover button too lightly, he dropped like a stone. When I hit the flight button, Iron Man shot forward at Ludicrous Speed - and I couldn't slow down. At all.

In a nutshell, I spent most of my game time flying around at breakneck speed with little control, trying not to slam into buildings, attempting to hit multiple enemies with a poor weapons system, while trying to break a time limit.

MOST IMPORTANT! This game requires you to have your Xbox360 plugged in the internet and that you have a Gold Membership at Xbox Live! If you do not do so, you CANNOT save your progress! I played for several hours when I discovered that. A total waste of time. There is a warning when the game starts but I thought they meant XLive achievements, which I don't care about. There is NO warning on the box when you purchase it!!

The above is completely unacceptable. Maybe the company had some misguided thoughts about using this as a protection against pirating. It is inexcusable nonetheless, especially since there is no warning on the box. Boycott such practices! I am returning my copy to BestBuy shortly.

In and of itself the above should condemn this product, but for those who do not mind the above outrage, I continue with pros and cons.

Pros:
- some parts of the graphics are stylishly done
- controls are easy to use and intuitive

Cons:
- Overall camera is annoying and poorly done. Zooming and moving are difficult to separate in the heat of battle. You cannot see much in the distance because the angle is too steep. The camera is a constant annoyance.

- a lot of the graphics is very angular. I have an excellent 1080p TV and so I can see how bad it is.

- there is no pause. The phone rings? You need a bathroom break or a glass of water? Tough. You will be attacked and killed while away. Settlements are few and far between, so you cannot simply run for cover. Neither can you teleport (see below).

- no teleport over large areas. I spent a lot of time tracking over known terrain to go back and get rewards for finished quests. This is just stupid. All good games in the genre starting from Diablo and ending in Titan Quest have a decent system of fast transport. It is ridiculous that a new game would not have such a feature.

- no map! How are we going to get anywhere reliably without a simple map, let alone a teleport system?? Ridiculous!

- inventory is poorly and primitively done. At least items are grouped by general type. But, there is no good system of item comparison. I wasted a lot of time trying to compare new and old items. Maybe the developers should look at Oblivion for a clue.

- there is a jumble of skills, spells, abilities, relics, etc. Most don't make much sense and it is difficult to glean how they work together. You find skills in items! How does that make any sense? I found a pile of skills that I cannot use because they are not allowed to my character class. Stupid. On top, each ability can be further modified by its own enhancements and by other skills that enhance them. So, the character sheet is a complete and utter mess! Finally, there is no way to see important detail about the skill and ability stats and mechanics until you actually purchase them. And, you cannot return them.

- items have levels that make no sense. Sometimes level 1 items are better than level 2 items or about the same. What is the point of the level then?

I give it 2 stars for fun, because it does have potential but the extremely poorly thought-out features make it a total drag. One star is about right for overall score.

To those that gave 4 and 5 stars, here is my advice - check out Oblivion, Fallout 3, Titan Quest. Those are well made, well thought-out games. This one is garbage by comparison.",Beware! This is a terrible product!,1256860800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

In older editions, you buy the game.  No strings were attached, you could just play and play.

1)There is a horrible BEEP at the end of every dialogue press and every time you move the cursor on the screen. It's absolutely horrible and serves no purpose at all. So many people have complained about these silly beeps (they were in Stella deus, DDS etc) yet arrogant ATLUS did nothing to change this before the american release..

2) If you want to turn the sound effects off you get rid of that sound, but you also get rid of all the voices and all effect sounds in the game. Sound effects and voice are stupidly listed under one setting.

3)There is HORRIBLE subtitles spread over 30% of the screen in EVERY in game dialogue sequence. It ruins them and it can't be turned off. You can turn them off in all other RPGs why not this one??

4) The battle system is awful and very badly designed. 3 people take part in combat across a free moving terrain, yet there is no AI you must control all 3 characters. Imagine playing Star Ocean while all the other players stood still as one character moved. Laughable and frankly embarrasing.

5)After EVERY kill the charcter repeats a stock phrase like ""It was over before it started"" again and again and again. You can't stop this. Awful

6)Hitting the opponent requires you to have perfect reflexes and perform a 3 button combo, any miss and you will fail the attack, It's very awkward to learn and makes combat unenjoyable and dull. Think of shadow hearts with a faster ring and the need to be 100% perfect.

7)No widescreen, no prog scan, only stereo sound. Banpresto are way behind the pace nowdays.

8) The graphics are below par, and some characters are blocky and don't resemble the anime portrait that is in the dialogue boxes. It feels like a game, not a living breathing world.

Then there are a lot of minor, but very annoying, things that didn't get done. Throughout the manual it says to ""roll over"" things to get help. But most of the help system apparently wasn't completed, because there's no rollover help.

It says to press Escape to get out of screens. But it doesn't work on several of them, you have to find the exit button and press it. And the exit button is in a different place on every screen - no consistency at all.

Be warned if you pick up a used copy of this game that it likely has the bug as well.

As far as game play goes, there are absolutely no improvements in this version over previous ones. It's still painfully hard to rush the quarterback no matter how intense your DL. It's still ridiculously easy to run up the score with your passing game. Improving players in the dynasty game is now based on tedious practice sessions rather than once-a-year training camp, and the improvements are nominal.

And Chris Collinsworth's color commentary is muddy. I saw Madden call the 2009 superbowl--he's still got it so why not lend it to the series with his name on it? EA is shorting it's fans and be advised that someone else will come along and steal your market if you don't step it up!","Ok, now I'm pissed",1235433600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This was our first amiibo purchase, so we didn't know what to expect, quality-wise. We were pleasantly surprised to find that all amiibos functioned well internally, and were of excellent quality externally. Each one is very detailed and exceptionally well made for the price. They also add a fun element to the game...can get bonus items, unlock various boards for different amiibos, etc. The only complaint I have is that you must buy separate amiibo characters for every game. This is kind of harsh from a consumer's perspective. Still, I can see how these would make great collectibles, and it's just kind of a cool, unique addition to the gaming experience.

UPDATE (4-13-15) Above is my original, positive review of this product. However, this was very short-lived. Shortly after we began using the amiibos, specifically after registering our sixth amiibo (Toad), the game would no longer function. The system displayed the error code: 160-0103. It stated that if we continued to get this message, we needed to contact Nintendo support. I did contact them, and unfortunately, the only solution is to send our system to them for repair. They are going to fix it free of charge. However, we still have to send it out for the repairs to be done, which will take approximately 2-3 weeks, according to the representative. Worse, I was told that they will ""do all they can"" to preserve the saved content/game data on our system, but it may necessary to delete it during the repair process. Bummer! :(

Please note, the error with the system is ONLY occurring within the Mario Party 10 game - THE ONLY game for which we recently purchased and began using amiibos. ALL OTHER GAMES WORK FINE, and Mario Party 10 also worked fine prior to the amiibo purchase/use (we had been using it without the amiibos for about a month with no problems.

The remastered version has wonderful music, excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics, and an updated storyline which still retains the charm of the original. If you enjoy platform gaming, and love old-school-like graphics (in HD), I can not fathom how you would fail to love this gem!

Wait! If this game is so great, why am I giving this product such a low score? The answer is: while this may appear to be an actual game, you are basically paying TWICE what you should for a downloadable code! I will spell it out in large letters:

THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GAME

What does it include? It includes:

1)a code (voucher) for downloading the game
2)a cheaply made pin with Scrooge's face

What about an instruction booklet? Nope. Nothing else. While it really looks like you're getting the game on disc, all you're getting is a package, a pin, and a voucher. So, if your PS3 is not connected to the web, this will be useless to you! If this package provided an instruction manual, OK that would at least be something, and the pin which would have made a nice ""bonus"" item. However, I feel that this package is deceiving. It really looks like you will receive a game, but instead it's a downloadable voucher for the EXACT same game you can purchase for $15. The retail price of this package is $19, so to be honest, a few dollars more for a collector's pin is OK if you really want it (although overall this still seems like a waste of plastic in my opinion). However, people are already trying to gouge the prices, and here on amazon it's hard to find it for less than $30 if not more (some sellers are asking $50 and at least one was asking around $70)!

Bottom Lines: you are getting a voucher and small pin, that is all. NO GAME! If you are happy with this, then go ahead. However, if you just want to play the game I strongly suggest just purchasing the game online which you can do for $15 if not less. Also, for those that actually like physical copies of their games, I would encourage you to send an email to Capcom and tell them you would like to see a real physical release for this game! Hopefully this review clarified questions you may have had. Great game, but disappointing package in my opinion.","5 Star Game, 0 Star Package",1379203200,7,,

Stealth is not an option the entire game, you have to go guns blazing alot, especially missions where your freaking surrounded by soldiers. It is a joke.

-A SLAP in the face of the PC gamers that made this famous
-Clearly a console game with console graphics and action
-Console jerky mouse movement (think 10 year old on Ritalin)
-WHERE IS THE LEANING????? Oh yea ran out of CONSOLE buttons I guess
-AI is STOOOOOOPID and I mean dumb as a box of rocks. On normal difficulty, I can mow then down all day.
-Poor level design (horrible to be honest)
-TOTALLY linear although they attempt to convince you that there are other ways to go
-Creepy factor has been replaced by weak attempt and flashes of Alma
-Completely lacks the original dark feel and story
-Lame dialogue ripe with foul language for no reason.  In the original game when the guys would yell F*** or S*** or otherwise, it had a place and increased the realism.  They sounded shocked. This just feels like an onslaught of pointless cussing to make little boys giggle.
- Grenades (a fave) are useless as their concussive damage is nil. You drop a grenade in the middle of 3 guys, they run to the wall, BOOM....nothing.
- I could go on but hopefully I have convinced you to wait until $19.99

Then I learned that the main reason why it kept saying it wasn't compatible with DirectX to play the game is because I had a different video card brand than the one listed on the box.  Basically you *must* have ATI Radeon (latest verison only)  or NVIDIA GeForce (only the latest verison) the main reason why I say only the latest version because like I said before, the lowest requirements listed are bogus.

I regret giving up my Xbox 360 with a decent collection of games (including Kinect-enabled ones) - because there is still a huge gap between the games available for the One and 360. As an example, Limbo debited 3+ years ago on Xbox 360, and it just came out on Xbox One. I enjoyed Fruit Ninja over 2 years ago, and it's still not available for Xbox One!! Such a let-down.

Please explain why they made a new console that won't play Xbox 360 games? That's really stupid, and I have only myself to blame because I trusted Microsoft to port existing games quickly, since they've decided to break compatibility on purpose.

I would also like to point out that Xbox One games/apps are sluggish despite the up-to-date hardware. For example, Xbox Fitness is absolutely painful to use, as it loads a full minute (which feels like an eternity) and all animations and transitions are horribly rough.

Another source of frustration is the dashboard UI. Browsing for games (which I do frequently, hoping to find something interesting) is very confusing?! It's either one flat list of all games, or poorly defined categories with very limited number of titles. And I can't still figure out how to rate and review games/apps...

Finally, the prices for games for purchase on the console (downloadable) are regularly ~2 times higher than same titles on a disc (e.g. Amazon). That's just a shameless rip-off.

There are 2 level 50 dungeons, through which you may or may not be able to fully gear.  I know my warrior could not even half-gear for tanking.  This is major problem if you want to tank because experts require 50+ toughness.  Because of the limited gear choices for warriors you are required to buy a 10-20 plat rune to get beyond 39 toughness.  Toughness reduces the crit damage you take, which is of course essential.
This is also a game that rewards you in no way for running dungeons at 50.  The money is terrible, and there's always other people wanting to take turns with the mining/herbing nodes, which you can get in stillmoor anyways.  I also have a 50 rogue, and let me tell you, deepwood is packed full of rogues.  My warrior is on harrow, which is a decent server for guardians, but stay away from deepwood.  If you're not a cleric be prepared to have long stints of time where you just don't get groups.  On deepwood I have witnessed the 50 and lfg chat both go hours without a single message from anyone.  Your experience may differ if you play a cleric, they're all that guilds recruit on deepwood.  Who knows, this may be one of those games where people only talk and group in their guild.  A dungeon finder too is probably on its way, people have been going crazy on the forums and generally speaking, trion bends.
As stated earlier, there are 2 dungeons for you to gear up for experts, which are this game's heroics.  But in total there are only about 10 dungeons, and in experts they are split into tier 1 and tier 2 difficulty.  What that means is that you go from grinding two dungeons at 50 to grinding the first set of 5 expert dungeons, and then when you're done with that you grind the 2nd set of 5.  There is one raid instance currently, although another will be added from this event that they're running now.
My last point is that people are already leaving in droves.  They hit the end game and realized that there is nothing there and are jumping ship.  If this game survives it will be an OK game, but I can't recommend this to anyone until they add in a dungeon finder tool, more endgame content, better class balance, and a smoother transition between dungeons>experts>raids.",Don't buy this... yet,1302307200,7,,

The players look so real, the introductions, the halftime show and everything in the looks department is done right.  However, a game is only as good as how fun it is. While the game looks great they failed miserably in the gameplay part of the game.  The game is so staged that you can predict when both teams will make/miss shots (at least against the CPU).  It almost feels like a game that should only be played the last 2 minutes to see the outcome.  No matter how great your shot timing is and how open you may be, it doesn't matter.  You can play perfect defense and that will also not matter when it's ""time"" for the CPU to keep the game close until  the last 2 minutes of the 4th.
Here is my major problems:

1.  CPU will hardly miss, when they do they'll get a rebound most times giving them the advantage most times.
2. If your pass gets deflected it will land on the opponents hands and will be converted to 2 pts but if you deflect their passes it will only land in one of their teammates that's open and will score.  This happens way more than it should!  So, good defense actually hurts you more than helps.
3. Game is staged, it seems you can go on a run and be up 5 or  6 points and then your whole team gets iced cold, then the CPU will catch up go on a run and they may get cold, however it feels like the final outcome is decided by the computer regardless how well you play.
4. My career stinks.
5. Soundtrack want to make my ears cry.

I understand that making a game realistic is important but killing it with this type of game play completely ruins the game.  The game should be decided on your skills not how realistic a team plays because that means a sixers fan or lakers fan shouldn't even bother to play.

1.0,True,"03 3, 2012",A331U01T7DMMHP,B003G2Z4FK,Davidovich53,"This controller worked great - at first.  Now it keeps turning itself off every 2 seconds.  It's been rendered unusable.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't drop it, throw it, slam it, get it wet, or expose it to harsh conditions.

I'm now forced to go back to the default Sony controller, which is what I was trying to get away from in the first place.  The Nyko controller worked fine for about six months, and now it's ""bricked"" itself.  I know this controller was an aftermarket, ""budget"" product, but was I wrong to expect more from a manufacturer in the year 2012?

My original review is as follows:
The primary features on this controller are the L2/R2 buttons which give you just enough resistance to feel ""right"" when being pressed.  And they're in a concave shape (like the 360's controller) which prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping off.  If you're anything like me, you probably can't stand the mushy, imprecise, slippage-prone L2 and R2 buttons of the default Sony controller.

The ""rightness"" also applies to the face buttons and select/start buttons, which feel springy and deliver a nice popping feel, giving good feedback with every press.  The body of the controller itself is ever so slightly bigger than Sony's, which allows for a more comfortable, natural-feeling grip.

However, the L1 and R1 buttons by contrast feel flimsy.  The R1 button in particular has a tendency to get stuck in the ""pressed"" position, which actually does NOT affect performance: even when the button is stuck, my onscreen character doesn't actually fire his gun.  When I actually tap the button (in its stuck position), the added pressure on the button actually makes my guy fire.  This took a little time to get used to, but now I hardly notice it.

Clicking the thumbsticks (the L3 and R3 functions) takes a lot more effort than on Sony's controller; you have to really, REALLY press hard to make them click.  After using the thumbsticks for a few days, though, it's become somewhat easier.  Same with the D-pad; you have to press down hard for the movement to register.  Tilting the sticks to move my character/pan the camera also takes some adjustment; in testing out this controller on Saints Row 3, I had to turn my camera sensitivity way down because it was simply too fast.  Most games allow you to adjust camera sensitivity, so this isn't too big of an issue.

The fact this controller is wired may be a negative to some, but for me it's a positive because I don't have to keep buying batteries.  Another big drawback is that you can't use the ""home"" button on the controller to turn on your PS3; you have to hit the physical power button on your PS3, then hit the home button on the controller to sync it to the system.  Yes, you have to do this EVERY time you turn on your PS3.  It's a very minor step, but if your couch is very far away from your PS3, this could get annoying.  The controller has a nine-foot cable, with a Velcro strap to keep the cable rolled up if you don't need the entire nine feet (and let's face it, who would actually need all NINE feet?).

Perhaps the biggest drawback is that this controller does NOT have SixAxis controls.  You read that right: if you want to play Heavy Rain or Flower, break out the default controller.

I hope this review is useful (if a bit long!), with both the pros and the cons.  Overall I'm very happy with this controller, especially for only 13 dollars, as what was only supposed to be a second controller has now become my primary one.","Updated review, 11/9/12",1330732800,7,{'Package Type:': ' Standard Packaging'},

The UI is probably one of the worst I've seen for a NFS game. So many distractions when in a 'race' it's not even funny.

Firstly, I have a pretty nice gaming rig, 2.8 quad core, 64 bit rig with 8 gigs of ram, and a 9800 GX2 Nvidia card.  I am running Left 4 Dead, Fallout 3, all the new games, etc... with maxed out graphics and great frame rates.  I get over 200 fps playing LOTR online with maxed out graphics in some areas and around 100 fps average most everywhere else. The frame rate for Clear Sky was terrible running with the eye candy on.  Had to go to medium graphics and it was still a poor frame rate.

Voice acting is so bad, it's almost funny.  The characters all look the same.  The NPCs you can talk to just constantly move their mouths when talking, like you are watching a Japanese movie badly dubbed in English  The lips movement does not match the voice.

AI is terrible.  The NPCs just go where they want without regard for you.

I've been through entire game on my DH, and up to inferno on my monk, but I don't see any reason to keep playing.  All my friends have already called it crap and stopped.  I started out playing DH, but now that everyone else has rerolled DH...takes the fun out of it.

With game degrading mechanics all around ranging from:

-max party size is 4...why...I could make a whole list of reasons why this number is ridiculous.  big part of why my group is no longer playing
-drm...you have to play on their laggy, unreliable servers, no hardcore until this is resolved
-don't farm for item, buy them at the AH
-implemented crafting system, that is worthless - buy your items at the AH
-don't farm for gold, buy it at the AH
-character customization is very limited, once you reach inferno your already limited customization is usually reduced to 1 build with MINOR variations
-rune system is gone, yet even less customization
-every class has about -+24 abilities, 1/3 of these are actually useful
-some entire classes are just crap - hi witch doctor
-inferno is pretty much just for ranged characters.  everyone i know has re-rolled sorc or demon hunter
-the game is build around that you will use the AH to buy gear to upgrade, but the insane prices on the AH make it impossible for new players to gear out.  mind you that is today, I can't imagine 4-5 years from now.
-bosses only drop loot the first time you kill them, no matter what the mode of difficulty
-inferno isn't fun, 1 shotted from off screen = not fun, 1 shotted from everything = not fun, it's not even challenging, it's just stupid
-once you hit inferno act 1, be prepared to farm farm farm for cash before you can progress to act 2...for days
-character growth/scaling is insane...at level 50 you are using a 200 dmg weapon i believe, by 55 500, by 60 1600. the scaling makes no sense, why linear growth the entire game until the end then exponential.
-max character level is only 60, you are 60 long before you beat inferno, this appears to be a decision late in the development process which i imagine contributes to the terrible character scaling in the 50s.
-most classes get their best abilities by 20, ...why
-auction house constantly down/very laggy
-some classes (DH, Monk) are WAY better than others at the moment, this can only lead to character normalization or everyone playing the same class.  the classes just aren't well thought out.  they should each be uniquely powerful, and they aren't.  only the ones with invincibility excel, no other contributing factor
-the levels move almost exactly like D2, really...all you could do is send us to 1 new place???
-introduced new chat system, to promote gold sales/spam from third party vendors?  i guess they partner with anyone that pays, because you can't tell me at this point in life they aren't aware of spammers, this is far from their first game.
-no set bonuses, there are set items, but the bonuses are just normal bonuses like +25 str
- itemization as a whole is terrible.  every item no matter what it is, rare, set, legendary, just gets random + stats...could be int on a sword, some bows come with +stats to witch doctor weapons
-no armor types, any class can wear any type of armor, it changes depending on whose holding it - LAME
-legendary items can have worse stats than blues of the same level - ????????????????
-i've had one legendary drop - level 34 item, that's insane - one full game clear, and another char up to inferno
-the same amount of magic find, doesn't increase drops like having NV - giving you the same amount of magic find does.  there is a hidden mechanic
- merc AI is way worse than D2
-mercs do no dmg, provide little support/purpose

Improvements over Diablo 2:
-great party system...based on DRM, and the annoying and confusing blizzard battle tag or whatever its called
-graphics
-sound
-Nephalem Valor is a fun idea, but locks you into playing lengthy sessions, and for some reason punishes you for switching between your limited skills.  Wouldn't be surprised to see a lawsuit about how some terrible moms kid couldn't leave his computer because he didn't want to lose his 5 stacks.

Final thought:  The auction house killed this game.  Yes, you can choose not to use it, but that isn't how the game is designed to be played.

You get colorization options which is very nice because you can give each squad member their own color or simply color them based on class so you're not wondering what those symbols next to their names mean.  The helmets are also a really nice addition, especially when you start using the heavy armors.  It really just looks silly having an exposed face/head with heavy, high-tech armor.

There's also some new hairstyles, including a classic Xcom ""flat top"", which makes your soldiers even more unique and distinctive.

The Good: the graphics a good - nothing great, but not bad either. The weapons modding is nice. You carry 3 weapons, but can mod them on the fly. For example, you can change your combat rifle into either a sniper rifle or grenade launcher as needed for the situation.

The Bad: The shooting mechanics are awful. I don't know if it has to do with frame-rate or whatever, its just the worst of any shooter I've played. I tried different scopes and upgrading the weapons for stability, but nothing worked. As one other viewer stated - hitting a target felt like luck. Also, the environment doesn't work well for a shooter. It looks like it would - there are plenty of cover spots as per your typical shooter; however, you can't shoot from cover by holding the left trigger. You just have to step out of cover to shoot. Its kind ridiculous and unrealistic just going toe-to-toe with all of the AI you're shooting at. Overall, I disliked the shooting so much I was avoiding it - in a shooter!?
Making combat more difficult is that some of the indicators are terrible. Your health indicator is a thin red line beside your mini-map (which has plenty of red and is flashing red during a fight) so its really difficult to see. By the end the game I still wasn't used to it. Also, the indicator to show where you are being shot from is the same as the indicator showing that you are wounded (red blotches around the periphery of the screen. These 2 blend so that you have no clue which direction shots are coming from.
Every action in the game feels clunky and takes too much time to perform - looting, administering health shots, pulling out your phone for the map/camera/mission log, putting the phone away, etc. Movement actions are clunky as well. At the end of the game it was still taking me 2-3 attempts to climb up/on something.
I didn't like all of the ""puzzles"" they put in. You secure every zone by interacting with something in a particular room. Shoot your way in? No. You have to figure out some specific route through a building or 2 to get you there. That reminds me - overall the game is very repetitive. Its just made up of a bunch of ares where you secure numerous zones - all in the same manner. The story/campaign basically leads you to do this for some of the zones. The rest you can do if you want. The story itself is ok - nothing great. Though I really felt that the voice actors were good, their roles were badly written - 1 dimensional, overdramatic, and annoying.
Ah yes, the glitches. I don't mind the occasional brick floating in mid air or things like that, but when glitches affect game-play its a problem, and this game has a lot of problems. Every time you leave a weapons locker or you advance to a new mission, the game freezes for about 5 seconds. In the later stages of the game the freezing got more common - like in the middle of a fire-fight. Sometimes (usually when I was trying to use stealth) my weapon would just start firing like I was holding the trigger down and I had to press the trigger to stop it. The worst occurred in the last series of missions (where there is no turing back). When you go to mod your weapon (say to change from a sniper rifle to a grenade launcher) it locks up the controls. You can't mod or even exit out of the mod menu. You just have to exit gameplay and reload the last checkpoint.
Even with all of the glitches, lack of polishing, and repetitiveness, I think I could have enjoyed the game if it would have been fun to shoot the weapons. But as I said, the shooting was just awful.

1.0,False,"11 12, 2012",A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00009WAUO,Mike London,"I've already reviewed ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the ""Super Mario All-Stars"" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the ""Super Mario Allstars"" version).  We all know ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of ""Super Mario All-stars"".

""SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing""

To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.

Now, let's get to the problems of ""Super Mario Advance 4"", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.

e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.

Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, ""World-e"".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?

No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card reader

So, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" style of ""Super Mario Bros."".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to ""Super Mario World"" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.

Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in ""Super Mario 3D Land"", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, ""Slidin' the Slopes"", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.

Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the ""New Super Mario Bros."" series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.

In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.

For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, ""Super Mario Advance 4"" would be the definitive port of ""Super Mario Bros. 3""; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.

These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original ""Super Mario Bros."" had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.

In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!  Why oh why Nintendo????

Moving onto Regular Stronghold is a step BACKWARDS in the series. IDK, I'm hoping for major redemption when Stronghold Crusader 2 comes out. These castle builders are nothing but cheap simulators and give you absolutely nothing to shoot for. Crusader on the other hand...now THAT's A GAME!

It's amazing how games from 10 years ago..Zeus, Poseidin, Stronghold Crusader, Rome Total War, Praetorians etc have withstood the test of time and all the new games by the same companies with ""prettier graphics"" have literally been the biggest failures.

1.0,False,"01 13, 2009",A3VBVORJ38FPOU,B0016Q4UJE,Matt,"Wow, I don't know where to start.  This game was just ported horribly from 360 to PC.  So much so that they should've just thrown it in the trash instead of release it.  I'll start off with the fact that they must've been on something good when they decided not to add 1680x1050 resolution support for this game.  I mean, what the heck is up with that?  I think the majority of gamers will have monitors with a resolution of 1680x1050, in other words, most 20""-22"" monitors, yet they didn't add support for it.  Hardcore gamers might have a 1920x1080, or 1980x1200 display, but what about those of us who thought 22"" was sufficient enough.  Okay, so I get over that issue by choosing the next resolution down that maintain's a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), so the game looks OK at this resolution, but everyone knows that putting a LCD Monitor on anything other than it's native resolution really makes it quite blurry.

Ok, so I accept the blurriness but the game doesn't even feel like it's reaching 20FPS.  What's up with that.  I mean, my computer is pretty up to date with all recent technology.  I have not one, but two, GTX 280's in SLi, as well as the newest Phenom II processor released which is at a stock of 3.0GHz, however I have it overclocked to 3.6GHz, and I also have 8GB's of 800MHz DDR2 RAM.  You can imagine this system is quite awesome for Crysis, running usually a minimum of around 40-45PFS, even during intense scenes, and getting up to a max of around 80FPS.  So, why, does Saints Row 2, which is quite inferior in graphics, play at 20FPS and less?  Not sure myself but it sure does suck.  Sure, turning graphics down to low makes it run at a better FPS, but I didn't spend well over $1,500 on my PC to play a game on low settings.  I'm quite appalled by this, though I suppose I can't complain seeing as their competitor (Rockstar) didn't do too much better themselves on GTA IV.

Now, I regret not getting Saints Row 2 on 360 when it came out, because I was oh so sure the PC version would be amazing...boy was I wrong.  So anyway, those problems out of the way, there are still tons of other glitches and things that others have mentioned before.  One of the most prominent being items popping up out of no where.  Now, I understand it's a huge city, just like in GTA IV, but is it too much to ask for items to ""pop in"" maybe when I'm still five feet away instead of about one foot away.

All in all, the two games I were waiting for the most on PC (GTA IV, and Saints Row 2) both failed for me.  GTA IV is playable, but it seems much better on 360 than PC.",Biggest fail in the history of ports...,1231804800,7,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

There are really no curves to the details if you no what I mean. Lots of colors. If that makes sense. It is a glorified button masher shooter really. There is not a ton of strategy.

To the system - I basically don't see a lot new here compared to 360. The tv menu is kind of nice - but it is nothing better than my charter tv cable menu. lol. really.

By the time I got my seventh gen console, NHL '12 had been released, so I wasn't missing this game.  Yet I was strolling through the video store (yep, still have one out here) where I found NHL 2K10.  I wondered what the PS3 version of the game was like.  I wish I hadn't found out...

The menu is clunky and clumsy feeling.  Instead of scrolling through a list, you have to hold the directional pad towards the option you want to select and then press it.  So instead of pressing up and X to start a franchise mode, you have to hold the L paddle up and then press X (Why, who knows?)  Trying to do basic functions seems maddening.  Before, you could scratch players right in the roster menu, no big deal.  Now?  You have to go into the edit line function under the coaching options to swap the person out with another.  Was there a reason why that function had to change?  Also, there doesn't seem to be anywhere where you can edit your minor league team (you could at least see their lines in the sixth gen console games.)  It's understandable that the licensing was missing for the actual teams (meaning no game play) but it's actually devolved from it's sixth gen counterpart.  They also took away the practice skates that built chemistry and could reduce fatigue if you completed a drill (and if it was there, it was so buried to the point where I couldn't find it.  Whereas before, it was a daily option.

Then there's the gameplay that seems rather jilted in favor of the CPU.  Taking faceoffs is quite a challenge.  You go on the attack?  The CPU skates back to defend faster than you on turbo.  Your CPU-controlled teammates will follow the offensive strategy, but make absolutely no effort to move or cycle if they're completely covered.  Most of your one-timers will go completely wide.  But what about when the CPU attacks?  In that case, your defensemen get sand in their skates and leave the goalie alone on breakaways (which is an automatic goal.)  The CPU goals come from just about anywhere except for the narrowest of angles.  Seriously.  After four games, my team's goalie (Cam Ward - Rank 89) had a 6.35 GAA and a 67.5% save percentage.  There was never any fighting, just roughing penalties for hitting too much.  Also, changing lines used to be faster because you could cycle through, but now you have to select the line with a corresponding button (which sucks when you're trying to attack or defend.)  Also, you essentially have to set line changes to manual to have any control (semi-auto doesn't work for some reason.)

The menu's clumsy and the gameplay is terrible, so I can't recommend anyone get it.  If you're adamant about playing a 2K10 title, go play it on a sixth gen system like Playstation 2.

If you agree with the below, feel free to copy/paste on other sites/boards.

Personally, I said ""take a hike, Blizzard"" by not buying Diablo 3. As a matter of fact, having been burnt by the horrible game of Star Wars: The Old Republic, I did not even buy Mass Effect 3 (I read gamers' reviews first and it turns out not buying it was a good decision) and, most certainly, I will never preorder ANY game (no matter how much I want to preorder X-COM: Enemy Unknown).

Over the last 5 years or so, game publishers have repeatedly lied to us, created incredible hype around their products, raised their prices to unbelievable, unprecedented levels and sold us TRASH... and WE bought said trash. It is time we all learned our lessons and collectively started doing a few things:

- Deliberately ignore all game advertisements as well as all pre-launch statements, comments, promises and previews by game developers or their puppets such as GameSpot (would GameSpot give D3 a bad preview/review when D3 ads paid by Activision/Blizzard are all over the GS site?);

- Never pre-order anything, ever; Just don't. Ever;

- Never buy ANY game until a couple of months have passed since launch date. Why? Not only because there may be some foolish, nave, trusting romantics who buy and review it before you but also because if no-one rushes to pay $70-80 for their (potentially trash) games, then in two months' time the price (in view of low demand) will have to drop to more reasonable levels of $40-50 or even less.

If we do this enough game publishers will have to change their unethical practices.

Video gaming (and especially computer gaming as opposed to console gaming) used to be a true art form and the games stimulated your mind and spirit.

The games of the last half decade have grown increasingly dumbed-down, streamlined, simplified, trivialized; they have turned into mainstream Hollywood assembly line of mass-produced garbage. Most of these games stimulate nothing but your mousing or button-mashing fingers and in the process insult your intelligence.

It is time to say to game publishers:

- We want OUR gaming back;
- You will not tell us what's good and force it down our throats until we like it;
- We will buy what we want and we refuse to buy what we DON'T want no matter how much YOU think we should like it;

It is time the gaming community stood up to the tyranny of Activisions, EAs and the like.

Nope, his was too. I initially thought this used a USB connection to directly connect to the Wii U. It does not. Instead, it goes into your Wiimote and your Wii U sees it as a Classic Pro controller. There's problems with this that simply make this a bad choice:

1) Input lag is clearly there. It takes about 15%-25% of the controller's speed out of the equation, especially when your character first moves from respawning or from the match starting. This alone should make you close this tab and never look back.

2) It sees it as a Classic Pro Controller, so your C-stick will often think you're hitting the jab button. Perfect pivots and even following up with standard combos after a jab is so ridiculous. You may as well call the C-stick the Jab-stick. This is severely frustrating if you play competitively or online.

3) Uses Wiimote, so it uses batteries. This is a smaller issue that's not really a problem. But why use something that's inefficient, frustrating, AND wastes battery when you can just use a no batteries required direct connection instead?

Save your money and wait for Nintendo to release more official adapters for 20 dollars OR buy the Maytag version. Yes, this small adapter is also Maytag but the bigger Maytag hub is an actual direct connect AND it works with PCs. So either save your money by waiting for Nintendo's official 4 port adapter for 20 bucks or shovel out 20-30 dollars more for a Maytag 4 port adapter.

Installation was pretty straight forward.

However immediately after installation, the aftermarket wiring harness provided to support the 'nitro button' feature caused an overload in the voltage regulator and quite literally burned a hole in the transistor.

At this point, the nitro button turns on the fans, however when disabled causes the fans to shut off entirely and will overheat the console with continued use.

I contacted amazon for support and they replied to me saying that they only fulfilled the order through another seller and if I want to return the ""unopened or original condition game"" I could do so. First off, it's not a damn game - it's a hardware upgrade accessory.

Second - The problem is, since it burned out the voltage regulator on the xbox motherboard, without the wiring harness included with the fans, the xbox console would no longer work at all.

So I can't return the fans, I can't use the xbox without the fans, and it's who knows if that wiring harness will fail or overload the motherboard again in the future - possibly causing a total system failure.

1.0,False,"08 28, 2013",A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B0001ZZNLK,Mike London,"By this point, most gamers have tried the original ""Donkey Kong"".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, ""Donkey Kong"" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain ""Jump Man"", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.

So what is ""Donkey Kong""?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!

What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.

One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.

The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).

By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of ""Donkey Kong"".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).

Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"", and ""Super Mario Bros.""), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese ""Famicom Mini"" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.

In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version.",STAY AWAY!,1377648000,2,,

Installing the game itself and trying to play it for the first time gives you an error message.  It seems as if the 1.10 patch which you are forced to download corrupts your save game.  Since the game creates a save game when it first launches it is an impossible error to avoid.  After patching the game you will be informed that your save game is corrupt and that you must manually exit the game and delete the save game.  Seriously, the game forces you to delete its own save game just to play it for the first time.

While playing this game you will encounter the following:  You will get lock-ups leading to a frozen console.  You will see other players' characters missing weapons.  Most of the servers' ""channels"" will be full and open games will be difficult to find.  You will encounter serious lag during play.  Closer aiming will inexplicably cause your character to stand up.  The menus will respond slowly to your input.

There are other issues with this game beyond the glitches alone.  The graphics are poor for a PS3 title.  The textures are muddy and low resolution.  The game has plain lighting effects which fail to impress.  The blood effects appear to lifted directly from Mortal Kombat.  The control scheme is unnecessarily complicated with poor default mapping.  All buttons on the controller are used and some serve multiple functions based on the duration of a press.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really lead to superior control versus other, similar, games.  It's complex for the sake of complexity.  Features you expect in a modern game such as the ability to join one of your friend's games in progress, player muting, or even something as simple as your own name being highlighted in a long list of party members are absent.  Trophies, which are indicated on the box itself, are nowhere to be found.  They are promised in a future patch.

I'll write briefly about the headset as it's likely that's a main draw in the purchase of this bundle.  There are a couple of minor problems with the device.  The unit itself is quite heavy.  It is by far the bulkiest Bluetooth headset I've used.  You may feel your ear getting fatigued earlier than you'd hope for because of this.  The ear cushion is not adjustable in size so it may flop around in your ear as it dangles from the headset's hook.  The main attraction to be found is the giant mute button in the middle of the device.  Most headsets created  for use with cellular phones have an inconvenient mute function.  You will also receive on-screen notifications when changes are made to the unit such as volume adjustment, the mute toggle, and a battery charge indicator.

SOCOM: Confrontation isn't ready for prime time.  It has far too many show-stopping bugs and feels unpolished in most aspects.  I would stay far away from this game.

I have 5 level 80 characters of which one is a day from 85 and the others are all ranged dps so they will take about a week each to get to 85, since they all started in t10+ gear. So I have experienced every little bit of WoW short of the level 85 experience.

Whats wrong with Cataclysm ? Well, if you aren't a Goblin newbie, everything. The content is moderately interesting, but the quest engine is badly broken. Let me say from the outset that quite a few have completed all the quests in Vash, Deep, and Hyjal. But a huge number of players got halfway through the quest chain in both Vash and Deep and then could no longer find NPCs giving quests. The GMs say it is a known bug and is being worked on, but this means the only way to level pretty much is random dungeons. And these days, with so many in the same fix, the wait queue for a random dungeon team can run well over 10 minutes. For a healer!

And since questing has ALWAYS been the premier attraction of WoW expansions (only way you can experience the unveiling of the Lore) it is quite clear Blizzard really let us all down on this.

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

Like all of you, I loved the price of these headphones. The reviews looked good, so I bought one.  I only used it about 6-7 times over 2 months.

From the beginning, the sound wasn't great, and it cut in and out a lot. Never having used a headset like this before, for conversation while gaming, I attributed that to WiFi or the other person's connection, etc.  Until the mic just stopped working completely.

Normally, I would contact the place I bought it, explain that the item was defective, and see how their customer service handled it.  My expectation would be that they would replace it or allow me to return it since it was defective.  I love Amazon,  and have been a customer for 20 years, almost as long as they've been in business.  Amazon only fulfilled this order,  JD Powerhouse sold it.  I deliberately picked a seller with a good satisfaction rating. So....fast forward to today.

I just spent a half hour in an endless loop of trying to return or exchange this defective headset. It's impossible to get to a screen to even report that it was broken because once you click on ""Repair or Replace Item,"" then you have to choose your order that contains the item.  Once you do that, you get:  ""This item isn't eligible for return.  The return window closed on May 15, 2015."" (30 days from my purchase).  I naively thought that was for people who just didn't want it, not people whose item BROKE.

The real question for most chess players looking for some chess software is whether to buy Chessmaster or Fritz (or Fritz's Shredder).  I have used both for many years.  I actually go back to the days of Chessmaster 2100, which had the playing strength of perhaps a subclass F player, if such a player existed.

For the average player the conventional wisdom has always been that Chessmaster is better because it has more training features and is more user friendly, both in terms of ""fun"" kinds of chess activities and in terms of how intuitive the software is to navigate.  Fritz clearly has been the choice of professionals, partly because it will run without the disc in the drive (although earlier versions of Chessmaster did run without the disc in the drive), partly because Fritz's architecture is considered more elegant, partly because Fritz has a much bigger database of games, and finally because Fritz's chess engine is stronger.

Chessmaster's ""personalities"" (with ratings) that you can play against have always been one of its most popular features.  Chessmaster 10 has the same personalities, from grandmaster-like virtuals to everyday kind of people (complete with mug shots) playing at easy to beat levels, that it has had in previous editions.  The problem with these personalities--or maybe this is their main virtue--is they are not as strong as the ratings that Chessmaster gives them.  A 2100 Chessmaster personality actually plays like a low B player, while on Fritz it is the other way around, with their 1800 players playing like experts or in some positions like masters.  Psychologically speaking, I think Chessmaster has the right approach.  For someone preparing for their first tournament against rated players, however, just playing against Chessmaster's personalities can be like living in lollypop land.  Still, these personalities have some real value as training devices.  Some of them (with ratings between say, 1900 and 2150) function like this: they give away material, even as much as a piece for two pawns and then play a very strong game that can test the user's ability to ""win a won game.""  Stronger personalities will lose a tempo or make an antipositional move or two that can, with careful play, be exploited.

One of the personalities is ""Josh age 12, Attacker, loves endgame, weaker positionally.""  This would be IM Josh Waitzkin as a preteen, complete with actual photo of him then.  I played against this personality a few times and ""he"" can make some strange moves and still manage to have a good game, and you need to watch out for traps.  ""He"" can also stir up an attack out of seemingly nowhere.  But his endgame is not very good.  The real Josh Waitzkin at age 12 would have no trouble beating this personality in a match.

Chessmaster 10 does not automatically save your game, as Fritz does, and I must repeat, you have to have the DVD in the drive to play the game.  Both of these ""unfeatures"" are annoying.  Additionally, Chessmaster 10, despite offering three patches at its Web Site, is still in not completely compatible with Windows Vista--at least not on my computer.  The line at the bottom of the page that gives the opening is so narrow so that the words and numbers don't quite fit.  The same problem exists with the text in some of the windows.  The program crashes on occasion for no apparent reason.  And there are a number of little bugs, such as once I set up the 2D chess set, I couldn't get back to a screen that will allow me to change to a 3D set.

Still, the program is very much worthwhile, especially for those of you who remember Zarkov and Chessmaster 3000, etc.  Today's Chessmaster engine is easily strong enough for all but the very best players in the world.  Chessmaster 10 will analyze your games to any degree you like (and alas find all the errors you made that you didn't think you made), and unlike Fritz it makes it easy to either load your game or to record the game using the human vs. human playing set up.  (Go to ""Game set up"" and click on both human avatars.)

Like Fritz, Chessmaster has an Internet play feature that I haven't used.

So--which is better, Chessmaster or Fritz?  You know the answer--it depends!  Personally I like them both for different reasons.  But if I had to choose just one, I would choose Fritz because (1) the huge database, and (2) to say it for the third time: you don't have to have the DVD in the drive to play.  For the less than master level player Chessmaster may be the better choice because the software is easier to navigate and more intuitive.  Chessmaster 10 is also cheaper than Fritz Chess (which is the same as Fritz 10).

But should you upgrade if you already own a previous version of Chessmaster?  Alas, probably yes, since earlier versions (or at least the Chessmaster 8 that I have) are not compatible with Vista at all.  Even so, I am disappointed that Chessmaster 10 is virtually the same program as far as features go as Chessmaster 8.  It feels like a dying program that has been abandoned by its creators.  Too bad.

Then I was dumb enough to buy the game...lol.  After about a week of hair pulling, countless crashes to desktop, a few re installs, I actually got into the game and played..for about 10 minutes at a time or until I zoned and crashed to desktop.  But these problems are covered in other reviews, let's get to the real problems.
1.  BORING:  Once you get past all the bugs, (if you can), you find out what the game is really all about.  Well...not much.  One of the main selling points for this game, is that camping would be eliminated by the ""random missions generators"".  The key word here is RANDOM.  Everything about this game is random and generic, and that's it's biggest downfall.  There is no sense of purpose, no sense of direction, and no sense of accomplishment.
The missions all start to look the same after about the 10th one, and you'll be on hundreds of them if you ever want any cash.  This also ties in to the lack of boss mobs, and lack of dungeons.
You fight mostly outdoors, or in the ""missions"".  Which are randomly generated ""dungeons"".  The implementation of which is absolutely horrible.  Mobs are spawned with no ryhme or reason, some dungeons have ZERO mobs in them, some have 5 that will all rush you at zone it.
2.  SERIOUS coding and engine problems:  Not even going to go into all of these as they alone would take up the 1000 word limit on reviews, needless to say it's overwhelming.
3.  Crashing, crashing, and more crashing:  Self explainatory.
4.  Character creation:  Suppose to eliminate cookie cutter characters, but it doesn't.  Sure, you can train anything you want, but because of the skill system, and the way the points you get to spend must be distributed to make your character viable, you end up with really only one path you can take per given proffesion.
5.  Monster AI:  The single WORST programming of AI I have ever seen in any video game...and that's saying a lot.
6.  Exploits, cheats, hacks:  By the time I left, which was under one month into release, there were already players that were level 150+.  Being that this is a PvP game, that's not good.  Exploits were RAMPANT and numerous.  Exploiters went scott free.
7.  Balance of proffesions:  Non existant.  The game is so unbalanced it's not even funny.  There are 2 viable classes to play if you want to live PvP, forget it if you play any of the others.
Just a note about me.  I'm an avid gamer, and have 3 characters over 50 in EQ, and 4 over 50 in AC.  So I obviously have the patience for online gaming...lol.

I'm tired of kicking this football, Lucy. I keep buying these damn games hoping, ""surely this time it will be better."" The original AC came out 10 years ago and this game is essentially exactly the same. AC2 was awesome but each iteration of the game since then has simply added more gimmicks not better play.  The addition of the spider-man-magic grappling hook even takes the fun out of the parkour elements. I found myself intentionally not using it to make the game more challenging.  Whats next? Is Imhotep going to give us a flying carpet in the next game?
Just adding hundreds of redundant missions doesn't make for a compelling game. How many times do they expect us to kill the same villain sprites in slightly different locations?  How about a game where we actually have to do some recon not just kill everybody wearing red pants? How about actually needing to solve a few mysteries, make some decisions with moral ambiguity, or simply just not having every important element in the game glowing and jingling. How about missions that don't spoon feed us every step and penalize us if we don't follow some arbitrary condition?
The graphics are no better than AC2. The game play is basically identical to all. The story is a mess. We should know exactly what we need to do next to move the story along, not be giving some random mission completely out of context that has us searching the map to figure out what the hell we're supposed to be doing. Even then they are all basically the same. Go here, use your magic eyes to find your target, Hit the E-key when you are standing behind them and wander around trying to find a carriage. Repeat. I'm sick to death of crafting. Of parkor scavenger hunts gathering meaningless trinkets--feathers, fragments, music boxes, whatever. Of cut-and-paste villains shouting the same 6 phrases.
There are so many games out there that manage to give us a compelling story behind the action: Dishonored, Tomb Raider, Fallout, Thief. A string of choppy cut-scenes and historical characters isn't enough anymore. This franchise could be so much more but it refuses to grow up.

1.0,False,"12 18, 2011",A2VZLHUQIJFVFM,B004CVQUOI,Kristin,"Don't bother spending time or money on Fight Night Champion. There are some good points to the game, though they all include the graphics.

Reasons not to bother:

Gameplay: The ""Champion"" or story mode is painfully short, and in a world of semi-interactive RPG style games you would think that EA would allow some control or customization of the character that you are playing. It is essentially a dozen or so fights (including prison fights for some reason) with a story interwoven. You are playing a movie, not a game.

The Legacy portion has potential, you can create a boxer (or play an existing one) and work your way through their career, however you can expect that at the end of your first 10 fights to be 0-10-0 eliminated by knockouts in all of them as (despite what other reviews have said there is no skill, talent or tactic to the game. You just mash buttons and watch your fellow hit the mat over and over again. To test this theory I cheated, I set all the skill levels to be fully to my advantage, purchased all the xp and boosts and maxed my fellow out. I was KO'ed in the fist two seconds of the second round with one punch (I was ranked 50th and he was 49th). I understand the need to have a challenge, but when the gameplay is so difficult that even with all the advantages you simply cannot win, whats the point.

Music: As expected it is all rap, but it is not even good rap, the music is just terrible. Mute the music immediately and save yourself the headache.

Prep: The time in-between fights is pointless. You'll have 15 weeks between fights (which is fine because despite boxers claiming that they are ""warriors"" they are in fact lazy pansies) however you cannot use those 15 weeks to train, prepare or learn, instead they will give you three or four weeks to prepare (One event per week).

All in all, the game is unplayable and the few joys you will find in this edition will be vastly outweighed by the fact that within an hour you will want to test the disk for it's garbage disposal resistance.",Terrible game,1324166400,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

The Bad: but will make you even more bored after awhile, messy unbalanced RPG elements, boring repetitive combat, graphics and sounds are ugly, every dungeon looks the same

I thought WotLE would be a great RPG and it is on paper but fails miserably in execution. The game is about an empire that fell to corruption and you are a mercenary sent by the king to find out what's going on. The ONLY thing that was good in this game was the music...everything else was trash. There are no voices what-so-ever in this game. The combat is a repetitive button mashing mess and the RPG elements are messy and unbalanced. You can upgrade your weapons and armor by merging other weapons and armor to it but it takes forever to get anything really powerful. Your special attacks are nothing special and hardly do anymore damage than your regular attacks.

The gameplay is very unispired, a few abilities, an auto-lock on system and spam away. Dreadful.

1.0,False,"01 5, 2015",A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B0009PKDOY,Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"If you thought the core concept of Sonic the Hedgehog, a speedster with attitude on a quest to rescue his animal friends from a fat scientist, was enough to make your mind spin, then prepare for something much more nonsensical, because Shadow the Hedgehog is a disaster of imagination; if you thought Shadow was a cool character in Sonic Adventure 2, that opinion may change entirely. It looks like as if Sega has had no clue what to do with the character after bringing him back from the dead in Sonic Heroes, and after this, and all the games afterward, I still think that.

Shadow the Hedgehog's story is an absolute mess; right off the bat, aliens come from the sky and some ghostly villain tries to make Shadow do evil things by telling him constantly to. The main protagonist, by the way, has amnesia, but nobody ever tries to help him regain memory; not even Sonic and friends. Instead, Doom (the villain) here provides snippets as the game goes along. Oh, and other things such as the president of an organization that murdered his best friend add to the ungodly onslaught of mindscrews that happen.

As for the in-game problems? They're as all over the place. Heck, this Playstation 2 version suffers even worse thanks to the technical issues that occur; I don't think the game ever went 60 FPS for more than three seconds. This game tries to retain the Sonic Heroes-esc platforming, but tosses in guns and even slipperier control. The levels have a bunch of gimmicks, but they often feel like just ways to get through the level or ways to throw you off rather than actually changing up the variety. Even without gimmicks, the levels don't want you to go fast; for example, in the first level, explosions happen at all sorts of places, enabling you to randomly get attacked unless you know the level by heart and dodge before the explosion happens. NPCs that serve as good guys constantly nag at you to do good things, while Doom's.....""eye""...nags at you to wreck stuff up. If you thought the voice acting was annoying in previous Sonic games, your ears are bound to bleed here.

AND THEEEEN there are the missions! There's the usual reach-the-end-of-the-level goal, but thanks to the false sense of ""choose your morality"" that this game stresses, there's also loads of ""kill loads of these enemies"" and ""touch all of these"", and there's no map screen for those things.

Your receivers will continuously get knocked of their route 15 yards down the field and the D will get an easy pick. Speaking of easy picks, the Defenses may as well be super human. They will break coverage when their back is turned and be on your receiver before the ball gets there every time. They will leap in the air and intercept a ball with their back turned. The ball will go straight through your receiver, who makes zero effort to catch it, and into the hands of a defender. Lineman can close a 10 yard gap faster than you can throw a ball 5 yards.

I tried to play career mode and found it nothing but frustrating. Your player, supposedly the #1 draft prospect may as well play for a high school team. You also get no help from your AI team mates. RB's will juke away from an open hole and run straight into your lineman, or they will run backwards. Your receiver, even stars in the NFL, can not catch. Balls will hit them in the hands and fall to the ground. If they do catch it they get separated form the ball on the first hit.

I played a game against a friend and it seemed to play a whole lot different. We both threw multiple BS interceptions however.

So why did I only give it 2 stars if it works perfectly with my mat and wireless controller?
Well it doesn't work with my sony PS2 controllers. I have four sony PS2 controllers and none work fully with this device. I have one controller that came with my slim PS2, two controllers that came with my fat ps2, and one controller that I bought and none of them work fully. The R1 and R2 are not recognized at all and the up directional pad doesn't work on two of the controllers.

Also there is major problem with the drivers. The company that made this doesn't exist anymore. So there really aren't any drivers specifically made for anything beyond windows XP. If you want to find the latest drivers do a google search for dilong 203 drivers but don't use them. Basically I found a guy on stepmania web site that had the drivers up on file hosting site. What happen after installing these drivers was all my fonts got messed up. I'm guessing the drivers were for a Chinese OS. Basically I couldn't read anything on my PC. All texts under my incons were foreign symbols. All text in all texts were foreign symbols. I had to pull out my nexus 7 to search the web for a fix. Basically I ended up using my windows 7 install disc to repair my pc. If you have a system that had windows pre installed and don't have win7 disc you would be in horrible trouble if you didn't make a backup or rescue disc. Before I found a fix I was getting ready to reinstall windows 7.

Now there may be english drivers that won't mess up your pc but it isn't worth the risk looking for them if you ask me. Anyway the basic drivers that come on the disc will let you use a wireless logitech PS2 controller and a redoctane dance mat.  I also tried a guitar that almost worked fully. The only thing that didn't work was the whammy bar.

So if you buy this for mat or wireless ps2 controller make sure to backup the drivers on the disc.  Personally I think you might be better off getting one that is known to work with windows 7 and one that is made by a company that is still in business.

Also note i did try restarting my computer and installing the drivers in windows xp compatibility mode to get the ps2 controllers to work. No dice.

The glitches are unbelievable and well-documented, so I've taken another reviewer's advice and gone back to playing Battlefield 3 on the Xbox 360.  Until the online issues are resolved this is not worth owning.  I'm actually regretting my decision to buy an Xbox One, as I only wanted to play this and Forza 5 (also mediocre).  With that, the single player is probably the best for the Battlefield franchise.  Note that picking which Battlefield single-player is best is like trying to choose which bout of food poisoning in your life was your favorite.  It doesn't matter how it's done, the overall experience just sucks.  The set pieces/levels are impressive but the story is incredibly hokey and will get on your nerves.  A HUGE note if you're a parent thinking about getting this for kids.  One of the in-game characters, ""Irish,"" drops more f-bombs than I've ever heard in a video game.  It gets old almost immediately and there is no way to turn it off.  This is coming from someone who has been in the military for over 12 years.  To summarize, you're better off playing Battlefield 3 for Xbox 360 and YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR CHILDREN.

*EDIT* 1/16/14:  I can't believe how awful this still plays online.  I play with an very good internet connection and the lag is still unbelievable.  It sucks so much because the game looks like it could be so much fun, but I've never been more pissed off at a game than I get at this POS.  I'm really regretting my decision to buy an XBOX ONE, if you are smart you will wait.  The only thing awaiting early adopters is a broken, unplayable mess.  FML.

The game plays like it has some crazy irregular heartbeat.  Every couple of seconds... Wub-Wump.....Wub-Wump....  Lag after lag after lag.  It is completely disorienting and will result in many frustrating deaths.  I run a 30MBps connection with a 27-31 ping and it plays like I'm running it on a 56K modem.

I seriously have to go back 20 years to think of a game that compares to the crapiness of this one.

SUCUROM as I like to call it, is a pretty nasty DRM scheme allegedly designed to stop piracy. It fails miserably at its stated purpose (every EA major release containing DRM in the last 6 months has been cracked immediately). Pirates can and will crack any game produced by EA or any other company.

I'm not endorsing piracy. In fact, I hate piracy and always have. I own zillions of games for consoles and PC, and will happily pay full price for any new game that is worth buying.

However, I won't buy this one.

SECUROM installs with the game. It has some pretty nefarious things that it does aside from failing miserably at preventing piracy:

1. Securom is Spyware. It can and will send information about your computer hardware, installed programs, etc., to EA's authentication servers. I don't remember the US voting to allow EA to have Patriot Act access to my computer.

2. Securom enforces limited activations. That means that this game is really just a rental. If EA ever decides to pull the plug on their servers there is zero guarantee that you will continue to be able to play this game in the future.

3.  Securom is a violation of your consumer rights. Preventing resale by the use of limited activations is a violation of the ""doctrine of first sale,"" (google is your friend) which guarantees my right to transfer ownership of things I buy to anyone else at my discretion. Securom with limited activations makes this an impossibility.

4. Securom is outdated and ineffective. Game makers wiser than EA are beginning to get it and are releasing first rate games absent of DRM. EA is sticking to their doomed business model that will ultimately be their downfall. Spore tanked and sold far, far fewer games than it would have DRM free. DRM free options are getting better and better with smaller game studios realizing that trusting your customers IS A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL.

5. Securom is intentionally VERY hard to uninstall. If you like manually modifying your computer registry on the weekends, it might not be a big deal. For 95% of consumers though, it is a real chore.

SO WHAT CAN YOU AND I DO ABOUT THIS?

The answer is simple: don't buy anything from EA until they get rid of Securom 7x once and for all. I won't be buying this game, or Crysis Warhead, or Dead Space, or any number of other games that I otherwise would because I refuse to let EA treat me like a criminal. I am not a pirate, never will be, nor am I into letting EA (big brother) have root access to my computer. If enough of us choose to spend our money on other games that don't come infested with this DRM crap, maybe just maybe EA will change its ways. And if not, at least we've contributed to independent game makers who understand that we want to pay for great games, but not let them put a DRM ring in our computer's noses.

Here are some great minimal DRM to no DRM games well worth playing:

1.0,False,"09 2, 2006",AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B000A6K6D0,coopertex,"Urban Reign is a beatem'up fighting game for the PS2. You fight several gangs to gain territory and advance the storyline. The graphics are really good; character models look good, level environment can be damaged, and great looking fighting moves.

  Actually the fighting moves are the best part of the game. Using a combination of fighting styles that range from boxing, karate and wrestling- you can do the regular punch, kicks, jump kicks, grabs and body slams. You acquire more moves as you progress through the game and also increase your skill stats. Your skill stats consists of your punching, kicking, grapple and defensive powers; by increasing your stats, your character becomes much more stronger (though this happens over the long haul). I was impressed with some of the fighting animations as your character can do flips, jump in the air and kick multiple enemies at once and you can throw them into objects like cars, trash cans and the walls. A lot of the fighting reminded me of the many, Jackie Chan movies with clever fighting techniques and they were just as fun to watch in motion within Urban Reign. I also like the fact that the game is very long and contains 100 levels as apposed to just 15 levels like many other fighting games. Urban Reign sounds great right? So where did it go wrong?

  The disaster begins with the unresponsive controls, you'll be button mashing like crazy and become irrate when the character executes moves slowly. Many times you'll want to beat up your enemies in a certain way while they are in a daze, to be hindered by your character's sluggish response. Many of the missions have a short time limit which will frustrate you even more. Although you can increase your character's stat skills and make him stronger, the CPU enemies will always be stronger. Aside from that you can be pushed into a corner and get pounded continuously with cheap shots from the CPU. Other than the fighting, nothing much else is taking place inside the levels; which gives it a empty feeling and the city overall seems abandoned and dead. The difficulty level will also tick off a lot of players as it just increases from normal to super hard in a short time. The worst thing about Urban Reign, is the terrible defensive blocking system, which they call ""deflecting"". You have to press the block button at the right moment to deflect the CPU's attacks, if you press it at the wrong time you will receive the punch/kick. While so many fighting games allow you to just hold the block button, this game does not. The story mode can only be played by one player, so you cannot play with a friend! The challange mode (unlockable) can be played co-op, but it would have been better and more fun if the story mode could be played this way. If you want a better fighting game, look elsewhere because this is not it.

Pros:
+cool fighting techniques
+100 levels

Cons:
-terrible blocking system
-sluggish controls
-dumb story
-one player in story mode
-tons of cheap shots by CPU
-you can be cornered
-unbalanced difficulty",Deflected The Fun Factor,1157155200,5,,

I could, but I don't want to open an EA account.  No one wants to open an EA account.  This has been a major roadblock to liking this game.

But hey I can still play career mode.  Let's do that.  Now this game is developed by Criterion Games.  They developed the awesome Burnout 3: Takedown and Burnout Revenge.  I've seen more than a few critics compare this game (favorably and unfavorably) to Burnout.  As a Burnout fan I can say this game IS NOT LIKE BURNOUT.  There will be no wrecking of other racers here.  In fact this game will punish you for touching anything.  If you so much as rub another car you'll slow down and they'll speed off like you weren't even there.  Boosting is controlled in very short bursts so this game never achieves the sense of speed I've come to expect from other Criterion racers and every track so far has been painfully dull.

The police are a little better because sometimes you get to ram outlaw cars, but it's never as satisfying as it is in Burnout and the police career mode is still full of boring tracks and penalties for reckless driving.

Also this game only seems to be in a wide screen format and the text is very small.  There actually doesn't seem to be much of anything in the way of options for this game.

Graphics is where SS shines: creative and clear details everywhere. Environmental design is not: after a short while the next corridor looks exactly like all the previous ones. And gives off the feeling of running in circles.

The game sounds are nothing to brag about either. The explosions and weapon discharges are well done, whereas the background music is good but nowhere near DS standards (I still use THAT theme as a ringtone).

There is no looting fun either. Dead enemies drop generic components which can be used to buy (equally generic) upgrades. No sets to complete, no unique items to find, no specially crafted weapons or armor to buy. As the game progresses cybernetic augmentations get available but as the in-game NTCs keep pointing out, there are added in expense to your character's humanity.

As to its length, it goes like the old Woody Allen joke on an elderly couple complaining about their rest home food: ""oye, it is awful!"", ""I know - and such small portions"".

Bottom line: if you expect a DUNGEON SIEGE in a futuristic setting you, well, that game is not out yet.

Nightfire is a mixture of the most infamous elements of the James Bond movies. Bond must stop a mad industrialist from nuking the world, and has several gadgets and female friends to help him accomplish this. EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, as the game features Pierce Brosnan's face as Bond, the familiar Bond theme, appearances by classic Bond villains, and other goodies.
But Nightfire lacks in several areas. First, the cool driving levels found in the console versions have been dropped from the PC version, probably due to lack of space. This leaves only 9 levels, which is just too short of a Bond experience. The game also seems to require a pretty high-end system to run. I have no problems running other recent games, such as Jedi Outcast, but Nightfire still stuttered along even when I set all the graphics options to low detail (and the graphics in Nightfire don't seem that spectacular in the first place). While I said EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, this isn't always a good thing. The Bond theme appears too often and quickly gets annoying, while the voice actor for Bond overplays his part and turns Bond into the stereotypical, cliched secret agent. Actual gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing special either. The levels are mostly non-interactive, small, and take too long to load (especially the Japanese resort level, where the game has to pause and load every few rooms, completely breaking up the gameplay). Finally, the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as AVI files onto your computer during installation. What's the point of playing the game when we can just watch the cutscenes, EA? Someone should have thought this out, and encoded the cutscenes as an unlockable extra, not give players free access to them even before they've seen the first level.
If you have a PS2, Gamecube, or X-Box, get Nightfire for one of those instead, and not this inferior PC port. If you don't, I can't really recommend Nightfire even to the most die-hard James Bond fans.",Horrible computer port,1044057600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Even if I put the damage to low, the fight is still short. This game is boring when I play with my nephew because he always selects simple mode for his team and so I have to choose the same or he will beat me. And in simple mode, all a player has to do is press the Y button (Xbox controller) and it does a special move. Many of the characters blast a powerful blast that reaches the opponent across the screen. And so it's really a game of who can press the Y button faster and probably first. But on regular mode, a player actually has to press down forward LP or whatever to do a special move. In simple mode, you can't even jump or do anything but try and press the Y button first. It's a silly bonus game for some that gets boring quickly, but for me, that's all my nephew picks, and so the game is more boring than some other fighting games for me. However, others could have move fun in the regular mode. I might try to beat the whole game in simple mode, but I'm not sure if I can get achievements.

I don't really like fast fighting games; however, this one's worse because the characters shoot out stuff fast, but they don't move or jump fast, so that ruins the game for me.

This game has a lot characters, but it should probably have more since it combines too main companies together. There's no Cyclops, no Ken, for example. I'm glad there are some goofy interesting and also cool characters from Capcom, other than just the SF ones, though.

Games are not that different. Visually and graphically beautiful games can fall flat on their face if not backed by a good story - see DAWN OF MAGIC and DUNGEON SIEGE II. THE CLUB suffers not from story problems - because it...does not pretend to have one worth mentioning.
In this Third-Person Shooter one fights to survive the blood-sport organized by an elitist club of uber-rich. Assuming one of 8 characters (each with his own story that led him to bloodlust), with an interesting arsenal at his disposal, this is a cross between a shooter and a racing game: unless you keep shooting at (and hitting) your targets your bonus multipliers drop fast.

2.0,False,"05 5, 2008",A1YP5OVRYFD4W9,B000XJNTNS,Johnny,"I have owned every Mario Kart game, and consider myself to be a bit of an addict, spending embarrassing amounts of time practicing things such as power sliding on straight aways and downing suckaz with simple items such as banana peels.  So needless to say, I was very excited for a mario kart game that would allow me to showcase my skills online, and relive memories with old multiplayer comrades who have since moved to other parts of the country.

Imagine my surprise when I put the disc in and discovered that there was no multiplayer grand prix mode!  Working in tandem to unlock new classes, tracks, carts, and racers had always been one of my favorite parts of Mario Kart, and it was something that Double Dash did to perfection, allowing up to four people to get in on the challenge.

I had invited the friend whom I played through all of the double dash grand prixs with over to do it again on the Wii, so after we found this out it sort of killed the buzz... but whatever, we had always spent a lot more time on battles than grand prixs anyway.

We found surprise again when we couldn't do a free for all battle!  After messing around with some vs. races on motorcycles we decided to ditch this game, and spent the night on the SNES, and playing bob-omb blast on double dash.

The bulk of my issues with this game can be condensed to three items:

-Lack of options
-Lack of skill
-Lack of creativity

Double Dash was filled with options, you could combine characters in various ways to get certain unique items or racer attributes. You could choose the number of laps in vs. races, and take your choice of three unique battle styles.  In Mario Kart Wii the lack of options is mind numbing quite honestly.  It makes the game feel as though it was rushed to production.  Why can't I choose how many computer characters participate in a battle or vs. race?  Why isn't multi-player GP available?  Why are there only two battle modes, one of which is hell of lame?  Perhaps most annoying of all... WHY CAN'T I CHOOSE TO TURN THE STUPID RACER NAME TAGS THAT SUBMERGE HALF THE SCREEN OFF WHEN I PLAY ONLINE!?!?!

The lack of skill required in this game was evident from my first GP race.  Every other Mario Kart game did a good job of making item boxes scarce, and the occurence of items such as blue shells and lightning very infrequent (although there was an OPTION in double dash to change this).  There are several tracks on the Wii version that are nearly unplayable because of the volume of items.  With 12 players, and the stupid items like the thwomp and lightning cloud that don't really help anyone... it just isn't racing anymore when there is absolutely no value to your place in the first 90% of the race.  Coming back with items is one of the great joys of mario kart, I understand that (I still have fond memories of hitting the super ramp on Mario Circuit 2 with a mushroom to cut a corner and jump up two places to secure first over ten years ago), but there is something else going on entirely in tracks like the Luigi Circuit on the Wii (which might be one of the worst mario kart tracks ever), where every racer gets ripped to shreds on every lap because of the overwhelming volume of items.

This gripe could easily branch into things like how the power slide boost, for the first time ever, is not controlled by the player (and I'm not talking about the manual vs. auto drift), but simply by the length of time you hold the slide, and how they reverted to the ""hold and wait"" technique of blocking items that existed in Mario Kart 64, as opposed to timing a reverse release to block such as in Double Dash, and how the ""get a boost when you are right behind someone for awhile"" time has been cut down to almost nothing... but I think I have said enough on this.

The tracks and items in general though... where is the creativity?  I'm not expecting the wildly refreshing array of tracks we were greeted with in Mario Kart for the GBA, or the slew of new items that required poise and tact to make decent use of that showed up in Double Dash, but there is nothing new on the Wii version.  Let me re-phrase that; there are a couple of new things, but they are quickly beaten to death via recycling (soooooooooooo many figure 8's), or in cases such as the mega mushroom, little more than repeats of other items (in this case, the star).  The half pipe thing is new... but I don't really see the purpose when it is faster to not go up the ramp?  And the motorcycles... who cares/if the drift controls were the same as in double dash no one would choose them for the cheap wheelie boost?

Then there are the lazy re-hashes of the classic tracks.  Changing the placement of item boxes, and other key features of the tracks (such as making the walls solid in the ghost valley track, and removing the rock throwing natives on the N64 DK track)... I just don't see the point.  I mean, I know that most people probably don't have every Nintendo console (sans Virtual Boy) within 5 feet of eachother in their entertainment room so playing Ghost Valley 2 on SNES isn't really an option... but seriously.  Some of these re-hashed classic tracks aren't even worth playing in the form they are presented here.

There are a few nice features.  Toad's Factory, Grumble Volcano, and Koopa Cape are amazing tracks.  There are a lot of karts to choose from (although the differences, as I can tell so far, seem to be negligible... unlike the kart selection in Double Dash where the differences were quite obvious).  And it's not like the game is unplayable, quite the contrary, it can even be enjoyable for short periods of time. As part of the Mario Kart franchise though, I just expect more.

I honestly don't know why though, as every big franchise title aside from Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess has been like this.  No options, dumbed down game play, terrible online game options and matching features, basically just leaving a ton of potential on the table and all of my expectations largely unfulfilled.

This is easily the worst Mario Kart game, and definitely the last Wii game I pre-order.

Oh, and the Wii Wheel... don't buy extras of these.  They aren't worth the hassle.  After struggling with getting my kart to power slide correctly through two grand prixs I dug out the cube controllers (ps - why is there no option to configure buttons how I want? Or... better question, why does the GCN controller layout not match that of GCN Mario Kart when the only new feature is wheelies, which could easily be added onto the unused c-stick or d-pad or... even better, onto the L trigger that items are incorrectly assigned to!?)",A ruined classic,1209945600,90,,

The first thing that surprised me was the lack of a rechargeable battery pack.  Way to send us back ten years!  I thought rechargeable controllers became the standard when the PS3 was released.

The next thing you notice is how rotten this controller feels in your hands.  It feels simply awkward.  Maybe if you used it for a solid month you might get used to it.

The third thing you notice is that the buttons are in the wrong place.  Anyone who has used a PS3, PS4, Wii FPS controller, XBOX 360, or XBOX One controller will find themselves constantly hitting the buttons by accident because they expect the second analog stick to be there.

The fourth thing is the touch pad.  If you want to invest hundreds of hours adapting to it, go ahead.  I gave up after five minutes.  There is a reason people use an analog stick or a real mouse to aim.  It's because touch pads SUCK for trying to aim.  If you want to mess with your settings, you can switch the touch pad functionality to motion control instead.  That might sound awful (and it is) but it's better than trying to use a touch pad to aim in a FPS.  If Valve wanted a touch pad option, they should have copied the PS4 controller or even the Vita.

The fifth thing that makes you want to smack your head against the wall - the dongle.  Yes, this thing uses a dongle to connect. BOOOOO!  Once again, I thought that kind of tech, for high end controllers, went away with the PS3.

Next you get the message.  Basically they warn you that most games are not designed for use with the controller so you might have to do some monkeying around with the layout.  You never get that message with the XBOX 360 controller.  It just works.

PROS

- the steam button works well and turns on your Link or other hardware.
- the build isn't bad.
- you get a butt load of free games (all of them old) with it.
- you can customize it without third party software.

CONS

- No rechargeable battery pack
- Awkward design
- Buttons are annoying to use
- Touch pad is a terrible replacement for an analog stick
- Does not integrate as well as an XBOX 360 controller
- It's rather ugly
- It uses a dongle
- The D pad isn't easy to use.
- It's super expensive for what you get.
- It doesn't feel good in your hand

The story is nearly non-existant and replaces S. Links with short cut scenes, leaving major sections without any character interaction or plot development. The combat is awful, getting rid of the 1more system in favor of boost, which was a poorly conceived downgrade. The characters go as a group instead of one by one, so many times a healer would heal themselves because their target died before their turn. I didn't hate the game at first. Even with paper thin characters and downgraded combat, I was enjoying the experience. The date cafe was a particularly fun dungeon that paired you with any character, including the other protagonist. That was right before I realized what this game really is though. Grinding. I watched five hours of cut scenes (which is insultingly low for a persona game), fifteen hours of exploring the dungeons and doing puzzles, and seventy hours of grinding. Persona 3 and 4 were both balanced to make grinding a last resort if you skipped too many fights. Here, it's basically essential if you even want a chance to beat the game. Reducing difficulties does nothing, so this is basically a minimum time requirement to beat the game if you don't exploit the auto-death spells like everyone kept telling me when I asked about the insane time. If I have to exploit poor gameplay to get through the game in a reasonable time, the game is doing something wrong. Do not waste money on this.

GRAPHICS:  2/10 - This game SORELY lacks, by any standards.  While I wasn't expecting it to rival high-end RPGs by high-end companies like Sony, Konami, and Square, this game's graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games, and I thought developers had moved far beyond this.  Blah!  Blah!  At least the FMV is decent.
SOUND:  1/10 - Ok, the sound quality is just God awful.  That, and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying, like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon ""hops"".  You would think that since this game would only become popular due to the TV show that they might have included the theme song...but no, of course not!
CHARACTERS:  5/10 - The characters are decently developed, I suppose, and reflect the typical air-headed attitude of the TV show.  The biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the TV characters make an appearance!  What's the point of having a Digimon game without any of the characters from the show?  Another fatal misstep on the part of the designers - most of the awesomely cool, powerful digimon from the show never show up.  There is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into, which annoys me greatly.  The other annoying aspect is that every 2 hours of gameplay or so, your digimon dies and you have to start the process all...over...again.
PLOT/STORYLINE: 2/10 - There isn't one.  That's all there is to say - the whole ""lets bring digimon back to file city"" crap is not plot, it's a pathetic excuse.  99% of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plot.
SYSTEM/INTERFACE:  3/10 - The battle system is unique, which is the only plus this game has.  In order to make your digimon even close to usable, you have to play an assortment of ""minigames"", where you walk up to a sign, press a button, and lo-and-behold, your digimon gains stats.  At first, I thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points - but it doesn't matter, so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you.  Battling is 99% of the game, and it gets boring relatively fast, especially since every 10 seconds or so you have to feed/clean up/immunize/rest your digimon.  Even tamagotchi aren't this needy!

The game basically runs parallel to the film, with many of the scenes from the film re-done in full CG effect, though many of the cutscenes look pretty bad.  Your job is to carry out missions based on events that you only heard about in the film; ranging from car chases, dodging cops, and above all, taking hostages to survive.  What's really sad about Reservoir Dogs is how quickly boring the game gets.  While you can choose to be a violent psychopath or a smooth professional criminal, either way the game gets pretty boring pretty quickly, and taking hostages doesn't really do much to the already lame AI.  The best thing about the game is by far the audio and voice acting, even if Michael Madsen is the only cast member to lend his voice to the game.  The graphics are choppy and the controls serve their purpose, but beyond that there isn't anything here that we haven't seen or heard before, and it hardly does justice to the source material.

Proctor,"I've used a lot of different gaming mice, most of them from Logitech (including the high-end G9x), and I feel like I've got a lot of insight into them as a result. Particularly as a demanding user for competitive FPS titles like Counter-Strike, Battlefield, CoD, etc., I've chewed up many a mouse, or discarded them due to a lack of quality or function. Unfortunately, it seems like I'm likely to get getting rid of this one, as well.

I've been using the Sensei RAW for months now, and it's got some good features; unfortunately, these are outweighed by some problems. The good features include a nice matte finish, dedicated RAW input, quality braided cable, and simplistic/minimalist design (which too many companies are getting away from . . . Logitech and Razer, I'm looking at you!). At the $20 or so price point, this mouse would be a contender.

However, there is a significant problem with the scroll wheel that seems to be experienced by many of the Sensei owners . . . within a month or two of using it, the scroll wheel starts scrolling UP for every 2-7 DOWN scrolls that you initiate. So when you are trying to scroll DOWN, it is frequently scrolling back UP a click, which is very annoying when reading text, and is deadly when gaming. Other problems include a rather sloppy feeling buttons (the left click creaks at times, or hangs a little; the thumb buttons are somewhat loose, hard to differentiate, and have a low quality click to them; etc.) and low weight (personal preference, but this thing weighs nothing and feels cheap). As such, not only is it not worth the asking price, but it's not even worth a sale tag, as the problems with this mouse make it hard to use/unusable.

I'm bummed out, as this is my first SteelSeries product and I had high hopes. I'm going to give another of their mice a whirl next, just so I can have some more experience to either balance out this first one, or to help me write off the brand in the future. I'm currently loving my new Corsair K70 mechanical keyboard, so I may have to move over to Corsair to see if their mice are any good.

By now, anyone who doesn't know at least the basic story of Lord of the Rings must be living in a cave. Hobbits. A Ring. A Quest to Take the Ring to Safety. Evil Riders. This game has them all.
The graphics are really pretty stunning. The little Hobbiton village, the forests, it all gives you a real sense that you're in Tolkein's world, interacting with the characters. Combat is simple turn-based stuff. You do a lot of message-delivering and mushroom-gathering.
Now, for the bad part. First, the game is very directional. You must get Item A from Spot 1 to Spot 2. Receive a coin. Take a message over to Person C. Get a cabbage. You gather a few coins by raiding your friends' homes and then steal their crops! Not very nice.
And when you've found these few items, you're stuck. There's no way to find more. If you want a third dagger for your party, sorry, the vendor only had 1. If you want to kill more Big Dogs to get your characters better at fighting, nope, you killed the only Dogs in Town.

I upacked it the day before Christmas, as I wasn't expecting it to be great right out of the box.  Of course it needs to be setup, games installed, Kinect tweaked, and such.
So I started installing the eight exercise and game discs I purchased to hit the ground running.  Insert the Fantasia disc.  Starts installing.  Two hours later, it's still at 10%.
I research online.  ""Disconnect from internet to speed installation"".  Done.  The install takes about half an hour.  I do the same for the next 8 programs.

Christmas morning game playing:  Start Rhumba dance program and get ""This program needs an update (5 Gigs!).  Do you want to do that now or Cancel?""  CAN'T I PLAY WHAT'S ALREADY INSTALLED WITHOUT AN UPDATE????  (no, I can't!)
So Ok, let it update and play something else.  Well, when every other program is started, the Xbox asks ""Do you own this game?  Insert the disc if so or go to Xbox Store"".  I CAN'T INSERT THE @^@^#$ disc because the Rhumba disk is in the box as required for the required update.  Arghhhh....how many days before I can actually use this damn thing?

And the Kinect voice recognition.  Works so-so at recognizing commands, but in this age of Siri and such, you'd think the Xbox could handle more than the twenty-some specific and mostly-useless voice commands.  Laughable effort, Microsoft.  I used to be an MS supporter, but after Windows 8 and Xbox, it's obvious this company has been run by out-of-touch idiots who evidently don't even bother to test their products for usability themselves.

The Xbox comes with a 500Gig drive.  Of course some space is taken for the Operating System, leaving 350-somes Gigs.  But do you think they could deliver it with ANYTHING pre-installed?  Netflix? Youtube?  A Blu-Ray DVD player?  One ready-to-play game chapter?  Of course not.  Absolutely anything you want to do with this box requires downloading.  Evidently the MS development team has a 130Mbps internet connection and it never occurred to the lazy techno-geniuses that apps can be pre-loaded, and that when you buy a game on disc, you expect it to install and run without having to download their updates.  And what ARE these updates?  Could they possibly give a hint as to what is needed?  Could I please use your product a bit without having to spend 16 hours downloading?

And the included manual....what a joke.  In several languages, it basically covers MS's butt legally by telling you all the things you should do not to have a heart attack while using their product, with no useful information other than a quick connection quide for only the basic config of a TV and TV cable box.  Mount your Kinect from 2 to 6 feet off the floor.  No details on optimizing it so it works well, nothing else.

It's pretty to look at, and the pleasure that gives you goes away in about five minutes, after you realize that the environment is nearly completely lifeless. Seriously, almost every area is completely empty - no treasures, nothing to explore, and for hours at a time not a single ""conversation"" to be had - just endless mashing of the ""X"" button for the occasional battle. Also, the story really is that incomprehensible. Honestly, after about 8 hours of playing the game, I still couldn't figure it out - despite detailed and boring recaps every time you load the game.

They try to change it up by introducing a ""paradigm"" system - which is supposed to streamline combat, but ends up just being a poor substitute for allowing you to control your characters' actions. Want to heal? Sorry, first you have to change to another paradigm - and THEN you can mash the X button for a bit - and maybe you'll heal in time. If you're not lucky, then the enemy will kill you in one hit - thus ending your game. It's just not fun.

The cutscenes are equally dull, surprisingly - lots of whining on the part of the characters for the most part, and the otherwise decent performances of the voice actors is wasted on skin-crawlingly-bad writing. It would be more tolerable if there were anyone else in the game to interact with, but no - you can sort of vaguely hear people muttering at times, but for the most part you're on your own... in depressingly empty area after area.

Supposedly it gets better later on in the game, but it's just not worth it. Trade it in for something that won't bore you to tears for 75% of the game. I gave up and traded it in.

the ff xiii trilogy needs to undergo a quick,& relatively painless abortion to save us consumers time/money that would be wasted on future abominations (hope, alyssa, sazh,& dajh[sazh's boy] all seem to b vampires[never age], it was much cooler when vincent from ff 7 was a vampire, now all the worst characters r in the elite vampire fraternity). i'm playing augusta tower 400 AF,& i just learned that the AI went rogue,& started killing all the humans(all i could think of was skynet had just come to power ,but where r the terminaters)

2 major ways it improve on 1: the collecters catalog is way better, the collecters,  connesuers,& survivalists catalogs needed to b used separately before(they would detract from other each others spoils),& all items can be aquired at any time, all on 1 disc (but no treasure hunter achievement/trophy this time)

I feel like the games peaked around the time of WCW vs NWO Revenge, Wrestlemania 2000 and No Mercy on the Nintendo 64. However I keep buying the games each year in the hope they may recapture the magic of those games, This years edition (WWE 2K15) was a HUGE step backwards!

Being the first wrestling game on the Playstation 4 I had high expectations, these expectations were dashed within the first 10 minutes of me playing. I started a career mode, created my wrestler and then it shows me in the WWE developmental territory (NXT) where Bill DeMott yells at me for 5 minutes in a video scene that I can't skip, I have to listen to Hugh Morris tell me I am not good enough to make it in the WWE for 5 minutes before I can play (STRIKE 1)

They then randomly select me and another wrestler to compete for a spot in NXT (I was almost expecting them to pick 2 other people and make me watch them wrestle at this point) I start to wrestle using my muscle memory from WWE 2K14 on the PS3 but then instructions flash up, guess what? We have made the controls WAYYY more complicated so now you must spin your L3 and R3 in specific directions to perform moves (STRIKE 2).

If that wasn't bad enough old mate Bill DeMott is yelling at me on the outside of the ring saying the same 4 try hard phrases over and over while I attempt to make the most of my boring matches (STRIKE 3). The WWE 2K franchise took what was a pretty good model and messed it up big time with this 2K15. I haven't been this disappointed in the WWE since that terrible booking of Brock Lesnar going over the Undertaker at Wrestlemania 30 (I will never forgive or forget)

Here is my tip for you WWE/2K... simpler is better, look at why people loved No Mercy and WCW vs NWO Revenge and build the WWE 2K16 model around that.

It only allows for digital downloads. True, the system comes with a large HardDrive, but since you have to download your game library, it won't be nearly enough room. Yes, despite this being a PSP system, it does not use UMD games, so picking this up as a replacement is pointless, since it will render your entire UMD library useless. It also prevents you from buying used PSP games, or renting/borrowing/loaning them.

Also, and this is a major disappointment, there are a number of PSP games, that just were never released on the PSN digital download format. So, while this is a Sony PSP brand product, you don't get the full benefits of a PSP product.

Sure, the graphics are nice, that should be expected, because it does play PSP games, but so does a PSP-3000, which is infinitely better.

As for the product design, it leaves a lot to be desired.

When the screen slides up, the L and R buttons are difficult to press, at least for my large fingers.

My 2 star rating is for the PRODUCT

THE GAME

the game is excellent, my personal game of the year for 2016, i could talk for ages about this game, but its absolutely a blast to play and its so slick iD did an amazing job developing this title.

I used a Nvidia gtx1060 6GB, and a i3 4130 with 16gb of ddr3 ram and the game runs anywhere from 85~120 FPS maxed out nightmare mode graphics settings 1080p, which looks amazing, to say the least.

THE PRODUCT is quite bad in concept and execution, its a single DVD with a steam code, that then makes you download the full game from steam in order to play.

But at that point i ask, why even have a DVD release of the game at all if you cant play it off the disc at all? Wouldn't steam be faster, cheaper, and more direct as well? I'm no idiot, i knew it was going to be a steam game from the back of the package.

but when i bought fallout 4 on disc, it installed about 5GB of data off of the disc, and the rest was a download. but DOOM didn't even have any data on the disc at all.

The alternate art is pretty cool, and it looks nice on my shelf next to my other games. but its a pretty lackluster package as well it comes in a bargain bin amaray case that feels cheap and flimsy

There is no manual to speak of, there is a tiny sheet with safety warnings and basic default controls, an ad for the season pass, And a code for the demon multiplayer pack, I'm not sure of that's some kind of pre order bonus, but its cool to have a little something extra.
The disc itself looks nice with high quality screen printed art, but that's negligible because i haven't seen the disc since I installed it almost half a year ago.

OPINIONS
call me old fashioned, but there was a time whenever you could buy games from a store, and they would all work offline, and they could be installed and played from a disc. GTA5 has version 1.0 of the game available fully on disc, (its 7 dvds, but everything is there, no downloads needed). i'm just tired of my physically purchased games being tied to my steam account. not to say i hate steam, i think its a service that should exist, digital games should be available, i just don't think every game should be a digitally downloaded one.","i love the GAME, but not this product (PC)",1483920000,8,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",
2.0,True,"11 9, 2012",A3SMWBV1QHQ3AA,B000NJH6YG,Chris,"You may note that I rated the game as ""fun"" but overall ""poor"". The gameplay can become a bit addictive, after a point. Once the hero becomes powerful and just doesn't stop, you can maul your way through enemies that once gave you problems. There's also a massive loot system, and you can combine simlar items to make higher-class ones. This makes for an incredible depth of customization, and a fun factor in picking your equipment, especially once you became the aforementioned death-dealing machine.

But up until you hit that mark, the game is just horrible. Heck, even after you hit it the game itself is still horrible. The story has some potential, but ultimately sounds like something that a two-year-old came up with. The hero loses his sister, searches for her, finds out she's been kidnapped, and then goes on a journey of self-discovery as he uncovers the truth behind a legend surrounding his family and the powers he and his sister share. The dialog used to deliver the story is absolutely bottom-barrel trash, and the voice acting throughout the game will make you cringe. I got to the point where I just read the dialog as quickly as I can so can skip the poor voice acting.

The map is asinine. First, it's huge, which is nice. But whoever made it basically took a giant square and ran a randomizer over it, plugging in a few numbers for ""max height"". Read: the game has too many hills. They're everywhere. There's no such thing as a flat plain anywhere. It's just up and down and up and down. It's like the developers never actually went outside to see if what they made makes any sense against the real world. I mean, it detailed and can be pretty at times, but the hills are just a pain. This wouldn't be a problem if not for two things:

1) it makes exploration very hard. If you take a wrong turn over a hill, you can end up sliding some stupid distance and not be able to climb back up. Because that one hill will be surrounded by dozens of others, most of which will prevent you from just hopping back up to where you left off, it can literally take 10 minutes to return to the top of it just to go the other way. This is incredibly obnoxious as you MUST explore the entire world to get the location achievements.

2) your horse is an idiot. Once you get one, you'll find that the horse randomly can't pass certain types of terrain. This is especially true of ~60% of the roads, which are bizarrely designed like very deep and broad ruts that are cut into the landscape instead of just being on top of the surface. The sides of most of these roads are so steep that the horse can't walk across them. You'll turn to leave the road to go explore some feature and the horse will get to the edge and then just stop or, more annoying, turn completely around and go the other way? You have to stop the horse, get up off of it, walk across over to where you wanted the a-hole to go, and then call it to you. You'll find that it can, in fact, make it across that spot, just not with you on it.

Speaking of the horse, it's annoying for another set of reasons:

1) it's supposed to make fighting foot soldiers easier, but it doesn't. The horse isn't very maneuverable, and the controls are just poorly done. So trying to fight enemies on foot is a pain of trying to get the horse to face the right direction and trying to get your character to swing his weapon on the right friggin' side of the horse. You also can't wield a two-handed weapon other than a bow from horse back, but you can use double-wielding from horseback. It's just weird.

2) you can pick up herbs and random objects lying on the ground and way out of reach from horseback, but you can't loot the enemy you just killed or open treasure chests from horseback. So you have to keep jumping on and off the thing every time you get in a fight.

3) the controls aren't just unintuitive, they're anti-intuitive. You have to press the up button to move forward. Normal, right? Not so when you realize that holding the button causes the horse to accelerate, and rapidly. And letting it go doens't stop the horse. Push up and let go of the controller, and the horse will keep moving forward. Neat? Kind of. But now you need to stop because some wolves are attacking you. You have to push ""down"" to stop. But you can only do that when the horse's movement is aligned with the screen. That is, if you've turned the camera to look to the side, you have to turn it back to face forward, THEN hit down to stop the horse. Otherwise, hitting down does something random, whether turning the horse to face toward the camera or turning it away or turning it some other random direction.

It's better to find a horse that can carry a lot of weight and just use it as a travelling treasure chest. Just park it near a transporter or in a nearby city and come back to it as you explore and find treasure you want to keep. The horse can save you a lot of travel time going between towns and cities, but only in areas where you've already killed all the enemies. And the transporter system works better anyway, and you don't want to try to be on the horse INSIDE the towns and cities because it's so unmaneuverable. I actually got my horse caught on a merchant to where the merchant's character was litteraly INSIDE my horse and neither of us could move, and I couldn't dismount because that button is the same as the talk-to-the-merchant button (poor controls). Fortunately, I was able to twist around and get free, but it took a while and was pain.

The controls are bad in every way. In combat, there's no blocking or dodging, just a ""jump back"". Swinging your weapon can take a while. Not that the swing is slow, but that it can literally take up to a FULL SECOND for the character to respond to the button press and swing his weapon. You can only swing a limited number of times, but that number appears to be random and situationally based and I have no idea what it is. I just know that after X-number of swings, I should just go ahead and hit the jump-back button before I get creamed. The ""jump"" button is also not the prototypical ""A"". It's ""Y""? X doesn't attack, but draws your weapon. The attack button is a trigger, but if you press it while under attack and your weapon isn't drawn, you don't attack? It's like the character is telling you, ""I'm getting hit and you're pressing the attack button, but my weapon's not drawn, so Ima just sit here and bleed everywhere."" What the hell?

The ""Power Wheel"" is a nice concept, but poorly executed. Each weapon has different skills associated with it, but the skills are grouped together so that if you assign a type for one slot, you assign several different weapon-specific abilities to that slot. All you have to do is change weapons, and the slot automatically changes to that weapon's skill from the same group. It's a nice touch, BUT, when you select the power from the D-pad, it doesn't pause gameplay to bring up the actual wheel. It just changes an icon in the top left of the screen, and because of the inaccuracies of the D-pad you often get the wrong power. And once you've selected the right power, you have to then press the other shoulder trigger. This makes combat a malay of pushing the attack trigger, desperately trying to select a power from the D-pad, and pushing the power trigger. I just leave mine on my heal spell and don't bother with the others because most of them have low percentage success rates anyway. All you really need in the game is just a lot of strength and an axe weapon with high slashing and bludgeon damage, and you can run over just about everything. The powers are mostly superfluous and not very useful.

Also, the treasure system is vast. This is, at first, a boon because you get to sweep through and get more and more powerful items. However, in order to combine items to make a higher-class one, you have to have two of the exact same type. Each piece of armor has a ""Set"" number, and there are least 600 ""sets"" in the game. A set includes helmet, chest, gauntlets, leggings, and boots. That's 3000 items in armor alone. Then there's dozens of different types of shields, and at least 100 different types of weapons, and at least 9 different types of ring. There aren't that many chests or enemies in the game, which means you're not going to find a lot of the same item in the wild. Some items are very powerful, but also super rare, so in order to get those to a decently effective and high enough class you have to find them and purchase them. This can be difficult as earning gold is limited since enemies do not respawn, chests do not refill, and you can only steal from each NPC one time. My suggestion is to save up until the very end and just power up your favorite end-game end-bringer by visiting shops.

The camera is also very annoying. It's constantly recentering, but the default angle the camera centers on is mind-bogglgingly bizarre. When you're on your horse, the camera recenters to what seems to be a large angle toward the sky. But since most of the game is bizarrely hilly as I've said before, and you'll be facing down-slope most of the time, this means that most of what you care about is going to be at the very bottom of the screen. If you try to angle the camera down, it will instantly retilt back up. When you're not on your horse, the angle is different whether you're running across a semi-flat area (usually ACROSS the side of a hill rather than down it), the angle is slightly upward. But if you're running downhill, the angle changes to look at a spot about a meter in front of your character, making objects just a few meters away disappear off the top of the screen. So you have to angle the camera upward to see where you're going. You also can't just hold the camera an angle since moving the stick even slightly will always move the camera as far to one side as it will go. So you have to constantly fight the camera's recentering by tweaking the right stick in the direction you want to move the camera. The entire game. Non-stop. It. Is. Really. Annoying.

Then there's the frame rate. The camera doens't move smoothly in any sense of the word. When turning, the screen jumps by at least an entire degree at a time. Running forward is jumpy too: object don't glide by the way they do in most smooth-motion games. They jump toward and eventually past you. The motion is eye-jarring horrible. You'll want to play this game on a small a screen as you can so you don't ruin your eyes with the motion-sickness-inducing frame rate. Part of the problem with the rate is from the fact that the game seems to load up the ENTIRE WORLD into memory, rather than just a small piece. If you can get high enough on one side of the map, you can see clear to the other side of it, including cities, towers, and fortresses. Most features, like smaller towns and NPCs, will pop into sight as you get close enough. But the actual lay of the land is visible at any distance, and you can see the trees being rendered from far away. If the developer had actually put a horizon that, the game would be a lot smoother.

Finally, there's the character themselves. I don't think they hired an artist to create the wireframes. They're just atrocious. Everything. The main character's main, NPCs, Orcs, Groms, and wolves are all ugly. Wolves don't have any of the sleekness or elegance associated with real wolves, either: they all look like pug-faced pitbulls and run around like spastic poodles. Bears are hideous. The only things that look halfway decent are the skeletons, and that's only because there's no a lot to them to screw up visually.

This game is bad. It's got a lot of good ideas, but it's just poorly executed. It definitely won't thrill you, and can be very frustrating at times. The dialog sucks, the story is sub-par, and the controls are bad. It is, however, mindless and generally easy to play. If you ignore the story and spend a few hours building up your character, it be an somewhat relaxing stress-relief to sit back, turn off your brain, and just tear through enemy ranks. When the price drops below $10, it can be worth the buy to have something to do for a week or so. But don't buy this game expecting to be wowed.

2.0,False,"09 8, 2009",AMVU3DGIYDFVF,B002ATYQLS,Patricia D. McCoy,"I bought this based on a previous love of both dinosaurs and monster battling games such as Pokemon. Of course I wasn't expecting much since previous incarnations of that combo have amounted to little more than electronic ""Rock, paper, scissors"" and I was pleasantly surprised when the battle system at least was decent, but it has other issues.

To start, the rating is accurate. The story is so squeaky clean and typical that even the parts meant to be interesting and funny won't make anyone who's over the age of five so much as crack a smile. You start as a boy who somehow has the funding to travel to a tropical island and live in a fancy hotel without parental supervision in order to train large carnivorous animals to battle other large beasts, perfectly thoughtless setup. This island is mostly populated with women yet for some reason you can't play one: Score one for equality, right? Wake up Nintendo, and realize that women are 30% of gamers now. As if that wasn't good enough, to progress and level up you get sent on fetch quests (Everyone loves a pointless fetchquest!) to hurry the plot along, and fight the same baddies it seems like an infinite number of times.

""SPOILERS"" DO NOT READ NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED BY THE PLOT OF THE GAME!
Some parents also may want to know that this game eventually delves into beings evolved from dinosaurs from another planet that are trying to colonize the earth by de-evolving all humans back to our rodent ancestors. One character gets turned into a giant rat, another gets fossilized and then resurrected, yeah, it's that level of stupid. Make sure that if your kid gets interested in dinosaurs you buy them a good fact-filled book or something. I know it's a kids game but they could've easily done an educational game instead of this drivel.""END OF SPOILERS""

On the pro side are the cleaning minigame, which is varied in difficulty and genuinely fun at times, and the battles. BUT, the amount to which you have to clean during the game borders on obsessive. To get all the species it could be hundreds of rounds of hunting and cleaning, not counting cleaning gems for cash. Battling is in actuality a very small part of the game and what battles you get are often repeats. You never really need to change dinos from your initial team, it's more than easy to beat everyone in the game with one arm tied behind your back.

In all the entire game is great if you're 5-7 years old. Easy battles, repetitive gameplay, and simple plot. Even the characters seem to push the camera towards items of interest (""Just go through the door on your left"" Game pauses, then shows left door) and you seem to be constantly followed by a horrible excuse for a female companion who is not only always one step behind you, but who also loves nothing more than entering into 5 minutes of dialog when you just want to explore. Imagine my dissapointment when I discovered you couldn't hit her with the pickaxe!

Even as a fan of monster games I just can't give this more than two stars. I swear this game has turned me misogynistic, AND I'M A WOMAN! For better games in this area of interest check out Spectrobes for DS, no dinos, but other similar elements with better execution.

2.0,True,"06 27, 2014",A36DGSUROAV1FV,B009P50BD2,Amanda Brown,"I bought this game based on the reviews and was disappointed.
 First off, it was way too cutesy for my taste; it was tailored like a young child's book.
  There was no map, so no areas of interest.
  I needed to click for hints continuously to find out what to do next, and the hints were oftentimes vague.
  I stink at tanagrams.
  Some of the games I had to skip because I didn't understand how to play them. others were so tedious I skipped them out of boredom.

Free-flow was good as ever, the control scheme was fine. The graphics were good, and so was the voice acting. However, unlike in Arkham City, the setting seemed lifeless. Arkham City had sharp textures, blinking lights all over the place, and sharp color contrasts. Goons prowled the city. However, in Arkham Origins, Gotham seemed completely lifeless. There were way fewer people on the ground, and due to the snowy setting, the whole place was an ugly gray. There was so much less to do and for some reason, the only way to travel around the huge city for the first 75% of the game was to cape-glide. I spent more time flying across the bridge and back than I did completing missions. It was, to an extent, pretty boring. Boss fights were repetitive.

2.0,False,"09 17, 2010",A2D3EIMH46WS1V,B002BSA20M,Berlin L. Brown,"My gripe is with the single player.  I gave that a one star and added an extra one star for the multiplayer.  But I don't player multiplayer that much.  Yea, it is just boring game.  The single player is short.  Even shorter than ODST.  And I will be honest.  I was pretty pissed about ODST.  You had an uninteresting main character.  Boring to OK fight maps.  It felt like a rushed game...on top of the Halo Universe.  Halo Reach seems even more uninteresting that Halo ODST.  I was shocked and let down.

What are the gripes?  Where do I begin, there are so many.

Before you say I am just entirely complaining. Actually, my main gripe is that the characters weren't that compelling.  The story wasn't that interesting.  The single player was too short.  I like Halo 3 and Halo 2. Those were good games.  ODST and Reach seem rushed.

On the single player:

+ The Bad:

- No Master Chief or Cortana.  People are talking about the Halo Universe and there is more to Halo.  And this is what you give us?  A boring, dying planet.  No thanks.  These directors get all cute and force us to care about your completely new take on the store.  Master Chief and Cortana made the Halo ""game"" serious.  He was a bad ass character and to completely take him out from the game seems absurd.  Not only that.  But, you gave us some random character with no story.

- No story:  You are a soldier, you kill the enemy.  Try to save the planet.  No real story, just shoot.  And maybe towards the end, the bring up some connection to the Halo Universe.  Boring.  Here is Master Chief?

- Boring ODST style game play:  It is basically ODST.  Your mission consists of moving around the maps and they throw enemy at you.  Occasionally you have a couple of Hunters to kill.  Here come the drop ships.  Shoot at the enemy.  They huddle in the same area.  Kill them and move to the next area.

I am not saying this is entirely bad.  But, I wish they mixed it up a little bit.  Besides the vehicle combat.

- AI sucks.  They say the AI is better.  But really, it seems like the advanced AI characters just move around a lot and at a high speed.  And they have more health.  I don't know if that is advanced.  You can normally kill them through attrition.  Just sit of them, dodge and find as much ammo as you can.

- Weapons still suck.  The weapons have kind of sucked sense Halo 3.  The enemy weapons are OK and much better than human ones.  But you still have some issues.  The pistol has 8 bullets.  I was hoping in some modern universe that the humans would put more rounds in their weapons.  Maybe they deserve to lose.  8 rounds for the pistol which is OK, but it takes two clips to kill anyone.  The assault rifle is still worthless.  32 rounds and you can't kill anything with it.  So you have about 600 total rounds.  I bet you only kill 3-4 enemy with all your ammo.

- No scarabs.  They had 3-4? In Halo 3.  Why none in Reach.

- No advanced modern FPS movement.  Like blindfire or hiding behind cover.  I know, I know.  This is Halo.  But, they added running and jet packs and space flight.  It sure would be nice if I could hide behind cover and/or sneak up behind the enemy (see Bad Company2, Gears of War, etc).

- Let down because I thought I was going to be blow away.  When we heard about Reach, I was expecting a 20 hour single play with a bunch of replay value and a great story.  There is some replay value, but the single player is so uneventful.  What is the point?

+ Good points

- Great graphics, great environment.  Despite my issues with some of the game play.  The environment is pretty amazing.  The background and the landscape do look amazing

- Some replay value for Single player with the ""skulls""

- Vehicle combat was pretty good.  Space combat, helicopter combat were nice.  If half the game was just space and helo combat, I would have been happy.",I only play the single player and it wasn't that fun,1284681600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The graphics are sharp and detailed, but the gameplay and camera angles leave a lot to be desired.  Not only that, the amount of ammunition it takes to put down a run-of-the-mill peon is near improbable.....two to three shots up close with a shotgun?!  I don't think so.
The camera angles are atrocious!  When you have to fight several enemies you have to maneuver your character all around the room (basically running around) to find other guys to battle.  And when you fight them you sometimes cannot even see them until they are in the midst of throwing a blow...that's not cool.
Usage of slow motion (a-la Max Payne, a superior title to this one) is helpful and pretty darn cool - you can throw explosive canisters and shoot them, causing an explosion around your enemies, plus you can avoid other bullets that way, as well.  Max Payne seems to be much better at this, though.
To sum it up, don't buy this title - ever!  If you are looking for a vigilante cop style game, stick with Max Payne.  It does everything Dead To Rights does and more, just with better success.  DTR was obviously rushed out of development, or it would not have been so terrible.  Rent it first - you might like it.  I'm leaning toward a majority of dislikes, though.

2.0,False,"06 10, 2003",A11A8GWG0IXBZH,B000067DPC,Mark Hills,"Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a pretty fair game- but it tries so hard to be a good game, but hardware and perhaps even legal considerations just kept getting in the way. Dawn of Fate tells the story of the events leading up to Kyle Resse's eventful trip back to the past to save Sarah Connor and destroy the CSM-101 Terminator sent to kill her and prevent John Connor from being born. The game is built around the standard premise of killing terminators, collecting technology for upgrades and of course, the survival of all mankind against the evil and monolithic, Skynet. You get to meet General Connor, Justin Perry and Catherine Luna- friends and comrades of Kyle's and you switch characters between missions.
It's odd that they managed to capture the look of post Judgment Day Earth, the battlefields and ruined cities perfectly. Everything Skynet had- all the vehicles- the H/K tanks and aerial units are all there in gleaming chrome, but that's all they captured. The sounds are all wrong. The brilliant purple plasma guns sound like typical game fair and don't have their deep, resonant stutter from the movies. Even the H/Ks don't sound quite right. It's like whichever studio owns the copyright approved using the appearance of everything, but said they couldn't use the sound effects. Either than or the developers decided to do their own. Bad mistake. Another flaw is that the Tech/Com soldiers and their weapons aren't really representative of the movies, either.
All I can say about the character models is BAD. Kyle Reese looks like Christopher Walken did as the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow, stupid hair and all. Justin Perry looks like he was carved out of stone and I won't go into how unfeminine Luna looks. Connor is probably the best rendered of the lot.
Mission play is broken up into 3rd person play, starting with protecting Connor from an terminator infiltration attack, destroying Tech/Com's computers and blowing up an H/K tank that has rolled into the top floor of the resistance's hideout. In that mission you have to protect a demolitions expert as he plants explosive charges in the massive hotel base, is a royal pain, because he does nothing to defend himself. Instead, he stands there passively getting blasted by terminators while you rush around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to kill them before they grease him. Later missions involve a secondary story that the programmers must have felt was pretty clever. They're wrong. As well you must prevent Skynet from steeling all the platinum from a Federal Reserve bank.
Apparently Skynet has just perfected the CSM-101 series infiltrators, but they have also been capturing normal humans and modifying them cybernetic mind control devices. One of these, Alexander Stone, blames Kyle for the death of his brother Gabriel and so has turned traitor, joining forces with Skynet in order to seek revenge. It is he the player must track down because he has stolen Connor's battle plans for an assault against Skynet's main base at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. But while you get the plans back, you can never actually kill Stone. I'm not entirely sure why Skynet would create these hybrids- dressed as they are in black and red leather with cybernetic implants visible on them, it's not like they can blend in like the infiltrator terminators do.
Finally it's the main assault on Cheyenne Mountain and you fight your way into the very core of the enemy's main base- blowing up everything in site. The hardest part being the attack on the central computer AI- the heart of Skynet which is apparently SO powerful that it is capable of mind control, a process that takes a few minutes while you work feverishly to cut off the computer's power source before it melts your guy's brain, thus ending the game.
So it's a pretty standard story line, except for the silliness of the hybrid part. There are plenty of weapons- grenades, rockets, plasma guns, machine guns, EMP weapons that stun robots for a few seconds- pretty basic stuff. The game offers a first person view, but as with any first-person console game, control is terrible and you're better off not using it except to look around at the scenery. One interesting function is Adrenaline- a function that makes you shoot faster and more accurately which enables you to take down baddies quicker than usual. It doesn't last long so it's best used wisely. Another problem is the Dino Crisis effect- opening doors just to get to another small area to open another door in order to get to another small area and, you guessed it, open another door. It gets old very fast.
While there are good concepts here, some nice graphics, the game almost seems crippled in places. Heck, you can't even walk off a ledge and kill yourself because the game won't allow it. But for the most part it seems to be a half-baked attempt to tell the same story that Bethesda Software did a decade ago with `Terminator: 2029', a somewhat more entertaining game, if graphically inferior. Dawn of Fate manages to tell a fair story with repetitive game play- go there, do that, kill this- if you've played Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you'll know what to expect. I'd be interested to see the Xbox version just to check if it at least has better graphics.","Good concept, lousy execution",1055203200,,,

I was wrong.

For an RPG, you have one choice and one choice only in the singleplayer game. Male. Human. That's it.

There are no classes. No races. You can allocate points to different skills but your combat will come down to this for every fight, I'm not kidding. Right click (fireball), rclick, rclick, rclick. Out of mana. Sword/staff L click, L click, L click.

You can't target mobs. You can't change targets. The game targets for you. You cant click a body to loot it. You have to walk up to it, an 'eye' appears and you hit the spacebar to interact with it. There is no mouse pointer on the screen at all. I hate not having control over what I want to do in a game. Let me choose my target, please.

The mobs, and boy the variety you'll see (wolves, bears, and boars), all come in packs of 5 or more. You won't find a single mob in this game it seems. The graphics are subpar. I read somewhere this graphics engine was being developed in 1998. Believe me, it shows.

The sound..I could go on and on about the sound. Suffice it to say, if you have a Creative card, GOOD LUCK getting it to work. I finally manged to, don't ask me how. The FAQ suggests (get this), removing your Creative driver and going back and using the ol' MS generic drivers as a fix. I guess they really are thinking in 1998, eh?

The quests aren't fun, the voiceovers are horrid, and fighting from mounts? Good luck controlling your mount or steering it. You'll dismount for ALL of your combat you'll get so fed up with it.

Pro`s
This Games highest quality is its graphics ... hands down the graphics are its best quality the Avitars you chose do not look overly cartoonish.
This is a mature game so your playing with other adults .. theres mild nudity and you don't have to watch what you say...
The game requires skill to play this game

1. The game has very poor customer service ... tried opening a ticket and it went unanswered for 5 days ... then when they did answer it the GM sent me a mail telling me i wasn't online and canceled my ticket and said open another ticket to resolve issue i must be on line lol
2. Buyer beware the game is loaded with major bugs ... the patches have not been anything about fixing bugs only nerfing / buffing characters
3. The gathering Profetions are very porly implemented all items in the gathering quests are set to rare that means you have everyone including higher lvl charecters in low lvl areas farming the monsters to get the items that = lower lvl toons not lvling.
4. performance issues that they say they will fix hasn't come yet.
5. guilds that want to go onto higher teir citys harasing lower lvl toons to get more into their guild to help them farm mats if not / not join them they gank you or kill all the NPC`s in the area so you cant lvl ... lol

I thought that this game would redeem the makers. The empire games in the end are far superior to this shogun 2 game. The map in S2 is incredibly crude, I've read other reviews that talk about how great the graphics are and I must admit I'm perplexed. The map and that whole part of the game seem almost an afterthought. The castles and towns are simple crude representations. They have taken away much of the functionality of the map to simplify it to the point of being useless and not very fun to play. The interface, instead of being a unified bar across the bottom of the screen is scattered all over the screen, you have to hunt for old buttons you used to use all the time.

The battle map does not have ANTI-ALIASING, as another reviewer has pointed out. From a distance your troops will look like so many purple smears on the battlefield. The battles have been accelerated to speed up game play, but it just means that they turn into free for alls in which strategy plays almost no part. The AI is also poor, some troops will just stand there during a battle and will not respond even if attacked. This is not a game that can be fixed by patching bugs.

If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz.

So my negative opinion of the game came after buying it, and completing the campaign, with no predisposed hostility.

Disappointment 1) The campaign was short, uninspired, and uninteresting. I guess I won't spoil anything, but it did not feel, to me, like a complete story (a la... Starcraft, Warcraft 1-3). So although I didn't care before about it only being the Terran campaign, I now do.

Disappointment 2) The battlenet system is just awful. The only people I know who love Blizzard RTS games are crazy for custom maps... RPG's, melee maps with custom units, etc... This new system disallows you from simply making/downloading a map and playing it (not to mention you pretty much can't make maps either, unless you have a master's in computer science). I won't go into the details, but suffice it to say you are stuck with a handful of boring maps on battlenet or the maps Blizzard included... and it didn't include many.

Disappointment 3) I loved Starcraft and Warcraft 2's editors. Then Warcraft 3 came and just tore those to shreds, with its ease of use and total customization power. I was expecting the next level with Starcraft 2; what I got was pretty much a gigantic excel spreadsheet full of jibberish I don't understand. Gone are the days when one could pop open the editor and add some new units or heroes to a map. Now, if doing that is still possible, you pretty much need to go to Starcraft U, and then spend several hours doing tedious crap that will get you possibly the same result as 2-5 minutes in the WC3 editor. This single issue would have led me to not buy the game, as this is my primary interest in Blizzard RTS games.

Disappointment 4) Campaigns and custom maps aside, the game is just a complete rehash of the original with less (and less fun) units. Almost as if they held back units for future releases, which is a total cop out. Firebats, medics, wraiths, and more all appeared in the campaign, so I got complacent... only to find the actual game was completely stripped down. At this point I thought ""Hmm... oh well, I guess I can just put those units back in custom maps""... oya... I can't... see disappointment 3.

So I'm pretty much disappointed about every single aspect of this long awaited game lol. I actually stopped playing it after only 4 days (yes, I completed the campaign, challenges, and played a dozen or so matches), and got the urge to start playing WC3 again (a far better, and more complete game).

I am really hoping the editor and battlenet things are addressed sometime soon, so I haven't completely given up hope; but this game does not measure up to any game Blizzard has produced in the past 16 years.",Unpleasantly Surprised,1280707200,198,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
2.0,True,"03 11, 2013",A1GX2G8RMCZQEK,B007FTE2VW,Marcellus Breuning,"I have always loved simcity, every version since I started playing it. The concept is awesome, it's every (big) kids dream to run your own city the way you please. Simcity 4 first introduced the region, where you could really create a small country with numerous cities. So obviously, the new simcity was going to be something to have.

I have played 35 hrs since I receievd the game. Not bad, considering all the problems people have with the servers and yes, I been victim to not being able to play, cities not responding properly and what not. EA and maxis have really screwed up. If you let people pre-order, you should have a pretty good idea of how much server capacity you should have once the game is released. I think they have not done a very good job, to say it politely.

The game itself: City size is very small; only about 2 x 2 km, which gets you're land filled up in a hurry. Many complained about it, but I am a bit hesitant to simply say that it sucks: it also provides for a challenge, cos you have to think ahead and plan in order to achieve your goal.
More importantly, the game has great depth; there is a lot to do, alot to tend to and a lot to consider. From resources to wind direction, everything must be considered when you start building. If you don't have an idea of what you want to achieve with one city, you are likely to just make a mess with a lotta unhappy sims. The multi city feature is also great, although it has some glitches of things not always working correctly. Having a department of transportation in city A should allow you to reap the benefits of that in city B, but my experience so far with 3 cities is that it doesn't always work the way they said it would. I'm sure those glitches will be fixed, and being online to play allows for updates everytime you log in. So stuff can be addressed and fixed fairly quickly.
I would have prefered not needing to be online for playing (like a sandbox mode you can do off line) but I guess they have their reasons for doing this and it comes with pro's and con's. For the game to be enjoyable though, they need to make sure you can play anytime you want to play and that is not the case (yet). I am enjoying the game, but hating the poor service provided by EA/Maxis/Origin. That's why I only give it 2 stars, I hope it all gets better. If not, they will loose a lotta fans, including me.

Addition after a few months: must say that after playing Sim city for a while now, I got bored with it. Re started my cities, but basically you get into the same stuff and once you're city fills your small land area you ar epretty much done. Things like traffic (which has been fixed but still isn't great) gets stuck all thye time, garbage trucks follow each other on the same route, firetrucks get stuck in traffic on the way to a fire... I got bored with it, plain and simple.

So if there is bias here, it is in their favor.  So on to the review.

This game is the best I think I have ever played.  It is ... well massive, the graphics are great, there are hundreds of quests for each race/class combo (so some Tuaren/Elf/whatever, some warrior/priest/whatever), and the professions add a new dimension to the game.  I think I had more fun mining and blacksmithing then questing for awhile.  There is a profanity filter (on by default, easy to turn off), and auction house to sell things to others ... the list of amazing accomplishments goes on for miles.

But then you try to play.

Blizzard just posted news regarding a hardware ""upgrade"" that coincided with enough lag, disconnections, and game simply crashing to desktop (how server hardware accomplished that I don't know but it started happening at the same time - I changed nothing) to make the game simply unplayable.  The server my main character is on had an 858-person queue last night (45+ minute wait), so I went to the server with my alternate character.  Lockups, server rollbacks that make you redo portions of the game, disconnections, lag.  Combine massive queues with game crashes and you get to sit there staring at your monitor trying not to scream.  Tonight I was simply greeted with the ""Authenticating"" message for many long minutes before giving up (usually takes 5 seconds tops), and this is far from the first time.  Before you think, ""wow, what a winer. This will all be over in a week or so"", just keep in mind that Blizzard opened up service to South Korea yesterday.  South Korea = tens of thousands of power gamers.

So yes, the game is incredible in many ways, including how much fun it is.  But it is a SUBSCRIPTION-based game.  That means you pay to play online.  Online games aren't much fun when you can't log in.  Take my advice and WAIT.  This game is only getting better and since you get a month free service and then pay (about 13 clams/month), you don't want to be sitting here paying for nothing like me.

That has been the case in the music industry with artists like Britney Spears Rihanna, who have all been just about hype and overexposure, and not even any bit of heart. That sadly has been the same thing with High School Musical for the movies. It really has been too much of a franchise lately. While we've seen too much from Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, and Cordon Bleu, the franchise has also shown show much cracks, that makes us say that it has to go. Not only as a franchise, but Disney has made so many lackluster games based on the movie series that it is just sickening. Now they just want you to say dance to the Wii.

High School Musical 3: Senior Year for the Nintendo Wii tries to capitalize on the overexposure of the Disney movie franchise, that feels like it is lacking heart, and something for the Wii that we've played before. The gameplay is not anything spectacular for gamers, and for those who've seen just too much of the movie series. The object of the game is that you play with the regular characters from the film, and try to move you way to the dance beats of the movie. While the graphics aren't anything special, the gameplay feels like it lacks anything out of the ordinary. After awhile, not only d you get bored with the game, you just feel like it is just something that should be tossed away in the garbage.

All in all, Disney has really cashed in too much with the High School Musical franchise, and honestly have made some of the worst video games that have been out there for a long time. nly hard core fans of the movie will be interested in High School Musical 3: Senior Year. But, as a game, it really feels like we've been danced out. All in all, if you really want a game to dance to, I'd suggest you buy Dance Dance Revolution instead.

There are three different ways to go about this game, depending on which artifact Pious Augustus chooses. This means that you will have to go through what is basically the same storyline three times. The lack of difference in the three paths makes the game rather boring; the only differences are what enemies you run into, the order in which you get the red, green, and blue runes, and slight differences in what the characters talk about. Everything else (the traps, the puzzles, etc.) is exactly the same in all three paths. You even go through all of the same stages, in the same order! ""yawn"" Boring.
The gameplay time is very short; it takes only 10-20 hours to go through the storyline one time. And it get shorter everytime since you will most likely remember what you have to do to get to the next situation. Also, none of the enemies are all that difficult to get past.

However as a souls player from the beginning (and earlier if you count Kings Field) Bloodborne was a game I had so much anticipation for and was so thoroughly let down by it when I finally did get to play it. (after a huge problem with amazon & the order of my PS4 which forced me to have to wait nearly a month to get to a physical store to buy a PS4)

Anyone who knows about the game essentially knows it is like a souls game but faster paced. That is very much true and that is the problem. The joy of a souls game is the ability to play your way and use your strategic methods to work around the problems presented by the environment and enemies. Bloodborne removes the strategic element and transforms the gameplay into a twitch gaming affair with one primary change. The removal of Shields. Thats all it took to quicken the pace of the game and transform it into Twitch gameplay dark souls. Imagine if Halo had molested Dark Souls 2. Bloodborne would be the illegitimate bastard offspring.

No longer can you effectively defend against anything, meaning you MUST play as a jumping, rolling, dodging, parrying fool running around like a chicken with its head cut off until you get a nanosecond sized opening to strike, meaning you have to guess when that opening will be there and hope it is when you do.

Also the game consistently overwhelms you with group mobs you have no practical way to split apart no matter how patient you are. You are forced to not only dodge one enemy at a time but more often than not a handful or even more.

Lastly, the game is ridiculously glitchy which may not be the games fault as it seems as if the PS4 itself is just prone to glitchy games. However, I will state that one glitch ended up breaking my game by causing my weapons to vanish. It would look like I was holding a weapon still yet due to my physical stance, but my hands would be empty and when I would strike it was like I was empty handed, having the reach and power of attacking with no weapon. I even went so far as to create a new character and even this new character was afflicted by this glitch somehow. I could not switch weapons by equipping an old one either. Whats worse is that this glitch is seemingly unique because I cannot find any info regarding it online. I will eventually try to reinstall the game data to see if THAT will allow it but I just do not know.

Spore isn't ""bad"", but it's not definitely not ""good"" and far from being what was promised.

Where did it go wrong? Well, each stage until you start reaching civilization is so brief, so boring and uncreative in gameplay that they've been designed to get through in an hour to save you aggrivation. I'm not exactly sure what they were thinking when they decided to include the first three stages in the game, maybe a marketing strategy? Maybe to hold up the games promise? Unsure. But they don't work and I think they should have been left out.

The creature creator promised to create creatures of your own design, but are so dumbed down and restrictive that you'll quickly be bored. It doesn't really matter what parts you put where, each part has a value that raises a stat and including them is all that matters. I'm also more than a little disappointed by the parts available for your creature. You have to run around and collect them in the game to make them available, but there's no real challenge in getting them and most are just stamps of the same parts with the same stats with a little different look to it (and I mean little).

Which creature you choose is simple: Cold blooded killer. Stop now if your not a meat eater, your doing it wrong, go start the game over - you can select your starting stage so it doesn't really matter anyways. You can be adventurous and say ""no I'm not going to be a meat eater"" but then your stupid cause all the other meat eaters just go feast on your little creations and an already boring game gets drawn out even further.

(See spoiler at the end of the review if you want an example.)

The journey from room to room is painful. Items have to be found, and while I don't want them standing out with signs pointing to them, I do expect them to be visible when I'm hovering right over them. That's just not so in this game.

Even when I've used the ""Hint"", instead of my reaction being ""why didn't I see that"", my reaction has been ""okaaaaay, if you say so"". You just poke around with the stylus and magically the item will appear in your inventory. Some items can be found in little expanding windows. I haven't actually seen many of the items, but, again, poking around will sometimes find something. These little windows are also used to solve the ""what do I do with the items I found?"".

This seems to be a game developed as a training exercise - but, instead of being sent back for improvement, it got put into production. A terrible story and impossible to find items add up to little enjoyment.

I'm over half way through this and I will probably finish it, but it's not something I'm looking forward to. Should I find any reason to revise this review, I will, up or down. If it wasn't for the interesting setting, I would have given this a one star rating.

In one of the rooms, amid major damage, is a vending machine in perfect condition and working. Also in this room is a museum display of coins. There is only one coin showing; and this ""museum piece coin"" works in the vending machine! Whaaaaat?

This game fancies itself as some kind of a perfect cross between a sim and an arcade racer, but the truth is that it totally fails to accomplish this goal.  It seems that being stuck in the middle ground isn't doing this new NFS installment any favors and let me explain why.  Individuals who like arcadish racing games will find this title a bit too difficult for their taste, since some sort of driving physics, albeit exaggerated and inaccurate, still exists and the car is not exactly easy to control.  Hardcore sim fans will be thoroughly disappointed as this game is just really not much of a driving simulator at all; physics does not feel realistic, speed feels artificially exaggerated to"" enhance the action experience"", finally, besides top speed and acceleration, cars do not feel all that much different from one another. Overall, the physics of this game does not even come close in comparison to something like GT5 prologue.

If all this wasn't enough, there is the graphics, which really does not seem all that sharp, as it appears to have been tuned down to prevent frame rate issues.  Furthermore, the gameplay was not very impressive at all, as it is an extremely linear progression, which does not allow much freedom whatsoever. Last, but certainly not least, there are compatibility problems with Logitech G25 steering wheel. The wheel feels off-center with a huge center deadzone (I tried playing with the options and didn't help) and finally the force feedback is all messed up - all this adding up to a pretty terrible driving experience with otherwise the best steering wheel on the market.

Overall, this game is stuck in a non-sim/non-arcade land, which really makes it hard to be appealing for fans of either genre.  In certain ways it is similar to GRID, but does not have the same impressive graphics, innovative features and crash sequences and so in other words, it brings nothing new to the table.

Over the years 3, 4, underground 1 & 2 and American wasteland (I didn't bother with project 8 it looks stupid and from reviews it was crap) I felt like the series was very strong between 2-underground 1. Underground 2 was ok but not as great as the story of 1. Once I heard on skate 2 being very epic I played it and I just came in to think ""I cant believe it that this is better than th games I grew up playing"" yes I said it skate 2 and especially 3 is much better than most th games although the early th games give nostalgia so I cant reject them as now bad games because they arent. its just that skate 2 and 3 are big imporvements that TH games never offered. As for this game it is much as the first skate game and tony hawk underground 1. As I began playing I just wasn't into the skate physics anymore and the controls were just wierd. I slowly did get better but the game felt bland. the voice acting is disappointing sounds like voice acting from a 2003 game it had that low quality sound to it. The game as some new mechanics such as the argo which lets you push your board (in a way this mechanic is stupud and wasn't neccesary. x does not really push the board anymore as it used to so youll be pressing that L1 button (I believe its L1) to push your board. its a little funky. there is also another mechanic where you press L3 and R3 down that does a slo-mo trick where you move around L3 and R3 to create your own odd trick in the air. this mechanic is also annoying and a fail (im sure you can read other reviews on how stupid this mechanic is) you can feel that the series is just trying so hard to get on the level of the skate series of games but its just not there anymore. sad to say but I don't think there will be another TH game that will impress gamers. skate has come up with the genius idea of flip tricks being done with the anolog sticks rather than just random button mashing that makes you do impossible skate combos. its just not all about that anymore. in fair to say if those new mechanics didn't exist and didn't tried so hard this game couldve been a average. You won't really get hooked to the story or yoyr progress (as with me) the game will force you to stop because those 2 new mechanics are just hard to master its very flawed. its hard to land slo-mo tricks the analogs aren't as responsive for those brief seconds as with the skate games half the time your character will force to bail leaving you to wonder ""why? if it was going to land it perfect"" i don't know either and its frusterating. the game has not lowered its price and the game is not worth 15 or even 20 dollars (I bought mine for 20 and used) if you ever see it for 10 or less theb pehaps you can see it for yourself. the soundtrack is dull and sadly skate 2 and 3 beats proving grounds soundtrack. How? because you can listen to your own favorite skate jams than to be forced to hear crappy tunes you dony want to here. its not that its crap but the soundtrack is fairly short and isn't as long or memorable as the other games. i believe underground 1 and 2 have a much larger list of artists and bands. in the end i believe this was the last of the series. its been 8 years without a th game while skate 3 was highly praised (just play that one instead) and as much of a old th fan doesnt want to admit but its just dry now and isn't the same.",... since 2 (I was about 8 or 9) The funny physics I was so used to,1432339200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

2.0,False,"08 24, 2010",A27GHMW38OR6ON,B0023CBY4E,T. Caughey,"IO, one of my favorite studios which brought us the flawed but still beloved Hitman series, the almost classic Freedom Fighters and the very solid Mini Ninjas, took a second swing at their Kane and Lynch property and missed. Big time. I'm a fan of the first game which I always considered to be underrated. The first volume was visually attractive, adequately written, deliberately paced and, most importantly, simple fun. The second is none of these things. To compound this the second outing brings over the two biggest failings of the first in a poor aiming/cover scheme and NPC AI.

The most immediate thing the player will encounter is the new Hong Kong grindhouse/mockumentary cinematic aesthetic. This works in a delightful way in some of the best menus seen in some time. Regrettably it slides into disruptive, unattractive gimmick during actual gameplay. The effort to create an ""in your face"" and realistic atmosphere with flat haze effects and ""hand cam"" cinematography gets old, even sickening, very quickly. There isn't a sharp point or eye grabbing effect in the entire 4 to 8 hour game. It's as if your watching a home movie filmed with a cheap video camera that a dozen children have wiped their greasy fingers on. Sprinting for any extended duration actually gave me a headache.

This general ""feel"" IO was shooting for permeates other elements of the game in unfortunate and undesirable ways. In a universe that is supposed to be dark and unforgiving one would expect the gameplay to reflect. Instead gimmick again triumphs in the ""censored"" effects. That's correct, the designers thought players would think it was cool that head shots result in a ""blurred"" effect over the enemy's heads. It's just like in cheap import movies or a documentary. Yuck, yuck, get it guys? This is also done with crotches. You can watch people be stripped nude and tortured with razorblades just no penises allowed.

The terrible art direction might be forgiven if the gameplay was solid. Unfortunately for the genre fan the aiming mechanic borders on infuriating. The first two hours of the game will be spent with garbage weapons behind a unresponsive and uncooperative target reticle. It's not that the aiming is difficult, it's simply poorly designed. By the final level in the game the player should have figured out how to ""game"" the targeting and so will simply breeze through with their top of the line weapons scoring blurred headshot after blurred headshot on opponents playing peek-a-boo from their cover. In addition to a poor shooting experience Kane and Lynch 2 falls desperately short on the second most important aspect of the cover driven third person shooter: the cover mechanic. For a game which demands the use of cover a well executed and intuitive cover mechanic is an absolute must. The one found here is wonky and troublesome. The player is forced, often through trial and error, to ""run and flop"", ""run and flop"", over and over again from cover to cover. There is no organic or natural sliding effects and most levels are poorly enough designed where the directional ""from cover to cover"" mechanic is a rare and often unneeded treat instead of an ever present natural flow.

This ties into the poor AI. In most levels the player is rewarded by rushing the spawn points of the enemy. By covering the distance quickly with a machine gun or semi-auto shotgun the game's predictable spawn points are easy to dominate. Even if the enemy does reach cover they begin their game of cement shoe peek-a-boo where they crouch in one spot and pop out ever 4.7 seconds to fire at you for 2.3 seconds. Repeat. On occasion an enemy will close and if he does so on a flank you would hope to be covered by your AI partner you will die. Every time.

I will briefly mention the storyline so as not to ""give it away"". Well, what little there is to give away. It essentially starts as a ""get the girl"" plot line and then moves to ""uh-oh, gotta get out of Dodge"" storyline. There isn't a lot going on and the little depth the story has is lost in the medium of its presentation. If you're paying attention you'll get it and it's not awful but it makes little tangible difference to the enjoyment you will or will not get out of the game. It's the sad looking orange slice next to your three pounds of hash browns. Hope you really like oranges.

The final point to cover is the multi-player. Considering the pathetically short campaign I hoped for a robust multi-player experience with exciting maps, weapons and diabolical backstabbing. The multi-player I got was borderline broken. The three play styles are conceptually fun (Fragile Alliance, Undercover Cop, Cops and Robbers) but functionally disappointing. In the confined areas of the maps and short playtimes there is neither substantial opportunity or real incentive to actually plan a double cross on your opponents. Cops are given little incentive other than to wait their turn to be robbers again. This is aggravated by a terrible selection of weapons. The few weapons that are worth your time are unlockable by DLC that has yet to be released but I'm sure you'll be asked to pay for. The overly healthy amount of life given in the single player campaign translates to muliplayer as well. This results in frequently needing multiple players to even kill even a single opponent, circling him and pouring magazine after magazine into them like a pack of wolves with Parkinson's bringing down a Moose. The alternative is to try to get really, really close and shotgunning him before he can turn around and back up 10 feet. There goes your well laid trap or the need to ever, ever use the cover mechanic in multiplayer.

All of this is not to say the game is totally devoid of redeeming features. The cut scenes take much better to the chosen aesthetic than the gameplay. Both the cut scenes and the choreography of the players draw effectively from popular culture and media sources such as Heat even if they do so a little too heavy handedly. The checkpoints are set out in a way that is convenient and almost invisible. Many of the pacing and mechanical issues are slowly resolved through the game and by the time you get to the final levels it is almost fun. Of course it also abruptly ends at that same point.

The bottom line is that if you're a huge genre fan this game is worth a rent just so you can see what it is that IO tried to do here. It's not a totally broken game so it might just be worth that $10 or an occupied slot in your Gamefly account. On the other hand there is little here to recommend this game to the casual or non-genre fan. One thing that is true for all parties though is that at well under 10 hours playtime and a broken multi-player experience this game does not deserve a retail purchase. I have to give this game two stars. It deserves 1.5 stars but since it's not literally broken, it began to come around at the end and it had glimmers of true creative competence I'm going to say two.

Pros:
*Awesome menus
*Well constructed check point system
*At least tried to bring fresh ideas to multi-player

The nes slot doesn't seem to have a problem getting the games to play but if it is bumped in the slightest bit it will start glitching out. The SNES slot is the worst, the games fit in super lose and they have to be put in a certain way for the system to recognize them. if you put the game in like you would a normal SNES nothing happens, it just sits in there not connected to anything. The game can be pulled out. With literally no resistance, if you flipped the console upside down the game would just fall out. I have to put the game in at an angle and leaning forward just to feel it lock in right, and even then it doesn't always work. It usually takes me 10-15min of fiddling around with the game just to get it to work and that's if it ever does.

First downs are 30 yards, there are no penalties, there's no kickoff, and there is no realism involved as far as athletic ability of the players.  For example, if you complete a pass from Young to Rice (remember, this is 2000!), and Rice has the open field, two defenders are actually able to catch up to Rice and tackle him.  This is flat out ridiculous, even for an arcade game.  Ditto Terrell Owens and Tim Brown, and I was able to stop other wideouts with linebackers just by squeezing the turbo button.
The emphasis is obviously on bone-crushing tackles, but after an hour of play, the only really enjoyable aspect of this is the ability to cheap-shot the offensive players long after the ball is whistled dead.  The field-goal kicking system is particularly vexing, as it was apparently designed by a chimp with ADD, and requires eight espresso-mochacchinos in order to maintain the twitch focus required to accurately split the uprights.

I've been desperately trying to find a good baseball game that a casual baseball fan like myself can enjoy on my Xbox 360. What I wanted was a next-gen version of something like a cross between Bases Loaded and High Heat Baseball. What I got was something apparently only the hardcore baseball fan can enjoy.

There's just way too much to learn in this game. I won't even begin to talk about what goes on off the field in this game. Fortunately, you can have the CPU control all of that, but knowing how that goes in other sports games, I figure the CPU probably is holding me back. But how should I know? I just want to hit the ball, score some runs, and strike some people out with great graphics as a bonus. Is that too much too ask? Apparently.

So here's my issue with the gameplay aspect, because I don't understand any of the general manager stuff that you control when you're not ""playing"".

Pitching: A lot of people do tend to have an issue with this, but I did get it down ... after a month of play. The control motions are supposed to mimic those of what you would actually do when pitching. So instead of something simple like holding a button down and pressing which direction you would want your pitch to go, you have to pull back on the analog stick, and motion it over to a certain spot, while doing all this with precise timing. If it sounds complex, it is. Your catcher is a complete moron, too. He'll tell you what pitch to throw and where to throw it. If you listen to him, you'll lose every game. If you don't listen to him, your artificial pitcher ratings will gradually drop. What gives?!

Batting: Oh my goodness. This is probably the BIG reason why I'm giving this game a low rating. I understand trying to make a game realistic, but come on. I don't know when I'm supposed to lean back, swing, guess where the pitch is going before the pitcher releases it with some invisible guessing eye thing, and aim for a certain spot on the field if I even get lucky enough to hit the darn ball. Yeah, you have to do all that. What ever happened to just hitting the 'A' button to swing, while moving the stick up or down to hit ball where it's going? Yeah, I guess the game developers thought that would be too easy or something. Can't have that! Oh don't get me wrong, there are classic controls. There's just one problem with this. You see you still have to guess where the pitch will go before you even swing. And if your entire line-up has a guessing eye the size of a dime, you still won't hit anything. Batting is just horrible. I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating it is to go through game after game and get lucky to just get 5 hits and no runs. Meanwhile, the CPU seems to be able to hit every other one of your pitches, and hits home runs every other inning it seems.

Fielding: Forget about it, unless you plan on using classic controls. You trying and throw it to first, there's a good bet he'll throw it home or second or ... well you get the idea. Your fielder rarely throws it where you want it to go. Oh if you use the classic controls, yeah all those fielding achievements and stuff ... forget 'em.

What else can I bash this game for? Ah I'm done ranting. But seriously, if you're wanting a baseball game for your Xbox 360, and if you're a casual baseball fan like me, you won't like this game.

The character leveling system was great by switching from tasks/missions to the types of armor you used. There is also a nice PvP for those who are into that. When you get into certain parts of the worlds, there are enough instances of that area to prevent over-crowding. The campaign missions are fun and it tells an interesting story. I appreciate the game is not Earth vs Everyone but instead there are 4 factions [you can only play for Earth] that are hostile to each other. In addition to the open world, campaign, and PvP, there are also group missions you can undertake in groups of 3. This can be with two friends or the game can auto-assign you some people.

Now for the problems I have with the game. While the campaign is fun, its also over really fast. There are not that many missions before the campaign is over. If you want to go with open world, the game really only has a limited number of areas to explore/fight, and they are extremely repetitive. Also when you move from one area to another, its essentially the same thing with slightly different scenery and opponents. Even the open world missions and strikes are the same. This is not open world like you get with Elder Scrolls or Far Cry. The story ending from original game is lame. You have this 4-way battle going on for almost the entire game. Then without explanation, you defeat one and that solves everything.

The types of characters you can play and customize are limited. There is not much difference between the three classes you can use and the weapons unique to each class are identical in game play.

The economics of purchasing are completely messed up. At the start of the game there is nothing you can purchase that is better than what you can find for free. As the game has evolved the developers have made it increasingly difficult to upgrade to the advanced weapons/armor. When I started playing you could go open world, have a few fights, gather some resources and buy new gear. Not anymore. Now you need to advance in rank before buying something and the game is extremely stingy on access to materials necessary to upgrade.

Finally the latest expansion pack includes adversaries you cannot killunless you buy the expansion packs. The expansion packs are expensive and you get almost nothing. If you max out on your player level with just the original game, some of the new adversaries can be killed. But if you create a new character, expect parts of the game to become inaccessible and unplayable. Perhaps the developers decided that if you want to keep playing the original game they will make it so difficult you will either quit playing or give in and buy the expansions.

1.  The game is loaded with planes that never made it off the drawing board, let alone into production.  Also there is not a single American plane to choose from.  No P-51 Mustangs, no P-47 Thunderbolts, no P-38 Lightenings, no F6F Hellcats, etc.

2.  These planes don't stall.  You can fly straight vertical forever in any of the propeller planes or jets.  Ridiculous.

3.  The missions are all preposterous and entirely fictitious.  One of them has you flying over San Francisco Bay shooting down rockets with rockets--a technology still in its infancy even today.  The submarines launching the rockets are--get ready--German U-boats!  Wouldn't it be a little more likely to have Japanese submarines off the Pacific coast?  The last mission is so imbecilic it made me groan.  You have to shoot down a giant aircraft carrier AIRPLANE, that's constantly launching dozens of smaller fighters to harass you.  Another mission has you flying your plane into and through a series of long underground tunnels destroying generators!  You know, the type of flying they all did in WWII.  Giveth unto me a break!

4.  Story is moronic.  It reminded me of PS2's ""Secret Weapons Over Normandy (SWON)"", in that you are constantly having to rescue an annoying girl named ""Marguerite"".  In SWON her name was ""Rose"".  Same difference.

2.0,False,"05 15, 2012",AP3V0ZR3XLVQX,B00269DX5W,Ton Yanzik,"Assassin's Creed II is a completely different experience in many different ways compared to its predecessor and has a lot of new additions. It was almost like a different game at first, until I experienced the same exact problems and realized only some of the new additions and changes worked well.

The tone of the game has changed significantly. Whereas the first game felt like a half historical and half modern day game where you were invested in both individually with only small bridges between them, it's not as easy to lose yourself in the historical side in this one due to constant reminders it's all really just an illusion, from the loading scenes of cities to shiny and vibrant objective indicators emanating from the characters. This hinders that part of the game greatly, but empowers Desmond's side by making it much clearer that he needs to actually experience these events through a machine for the people he's working for. Much more of the overall plot is revealed as well which further deepens the idea that his memories are simply that, ruining the realism. This is one of the many reasons why I felt Desmond's story was significantly better than Ezio's. Despite having as many details as before, and actual historical tidbits to read that are about the places, characters, and events in the game, Ezio himself is very plain and dull to the point of weighing down the entire story revolving around him. His only characteristics are being a delinquent, having sex as a regular hobby, and wanting vengeance for his fathers death. Of these, his thirst for vengeance is the only redeeming quality he has, and it's only really shown competently at the end of the game. This is also, in a way, a coming of age story, but fails in this regard. Ezio seems to completely accept becoming an assassin as soon as he becomes one and goes through no major challenges related to him accepting this. After the first few missions, Ezio as a character is an assassin, and almost nothing more. The other major characters are very subtle and most act as a part of the story rather than making the story themselves. Some of them are good, some are decent, and some are bad, but I felt few stood out in being as interesting as the major characters from the first game. I also disliked how most dialogue had a tint of modernization. It didn't feel like these were Italians from over 500 years ago, but rather 500 year old Italians told through our modern eyes, making the historical aspects lack even more as a result.

Along with story and tone, gameplay also changed drastically. No longer are missions repetitive. In fact, every mission is unique in its own way. Many are standard and a few boring, but there are several that are really great and a lot of fun. Many new side quests, tasks, and secondary objectives fill the map and add more to the experience, the most notable being the village Monteriggioni which you can renovate and make money from. This was my favorite new aspect of the game, which goes along nicely with the new money and item system. Instead of using the same weapons and waiting to receive new ones, you can now buy many of them, along with armor and other upgrades. This entirely new layer of the game makes advancing your equipment your own prerogative and lets you choose what to wield and when. Sadly, the game itself is not very difficult, making the different and better armor and weapons almost pointless. The hardest part about combat is landing a blow on your enemy, and with the newly added medicine item, you're never in danger of dying. This entire currency/item system ends up being more about building your equipment collection that the game allows you to keep (assuming you care about it) than better preparing yourself.

Combat and notoriety are the last changes worth mentioning. With new weapons, comes new methods of combat. This is especially true for the assassins blade which allows for new types of assassinations as well as a weapon useable during combat. With these added attack methods and items, I felt the new combat system was much more flawed than the last game. I would occasionally have to battle with the lock-on system and assassinations along with certain other attacks during regular combat were difficult to pull off due to the game not recognizing what I wanted to do. Notoriety makes guards much easier to deal with. Instead of every guard in the city automatically knowing you, it's judged based on your notoriety level and what you do in the game. If you're seen assassinating someone or caught in a protected area, you become more notorious and more easily spotted as a result. Lowering your notoriety level can be done in a few ways, but the biggest is tearing down wanted posters, which are awkwardly placed just to make you go through busy work to get to them. Although being better than the alert system in Assassin's Creed, this system is biased for certain actions. My notoriety was always brought up for pickpocketing even when the person didn't notice me, and some assassinations brought my level up even when no one else was around to see or hear them.

All of these new features and changes reinvented the series, and in some cases, improved it. But even with all of these, none of it matters much when the game mechanics remain exactly the same. The game is still heavily plagued by the same platforming flaws as Assassin's Creed, and is actually worse. Not only is climbing, jumping, and running still very flawed and frustrating, but with new buildings and objects comes new ways to platform, and along with that, even more flaws and frustrations. I couldn't even count the amount of times I tried climbing or scaling something and wouldn't be able to proceed for no valid reason, or how many times Ezio grabbed a ledge when I was trying to run from building to building or across ropes or bars. Almost all of my deaths were a result of trying to jump from one building/ledge to another and, for whatever reason, ended with Ezio jumping to the ground or bouncing off of the building. This hinders every aspect of the game and makes some missions extremely difficult, especially the ones that base themselves around this broken platforming system. A game that's all about platforming that has bad platforming cannot hope to improve when these basic mechanics not only remain the same, but also become more sensitive and overpowering as a result of the changes themselves. If you barely tolerated the platforming in Assassin's Creed or wouldn't want to experience it again, this is an automatic skip.

Other and mostly minor pros and cons include:
- Nice facial expressions that add to the story telling.
- Occasional promoting of a type of stealth the game does not support (hiding behind cover, sneaking).
- Very rare and random quick time events that are entirely pointless (such as a kiss, or handshake).
- Accept/deny screens for missions often times doesn't appear until after the cutscene for the mission, making them misplaced.
- Street singers/performers act like the beggars and similar people in Assassin's Creed. They're not nearly as bad and can actually be scared away this time, but why are they still here at all? They're not funny, cute, or entertaining - they're annoying.
- The pause menu doubles as your map button and the button used to see/read the historical tidbits. In some missions when I wanted to quickly view my map, I needed to work around these to get to it. Using a different, specifically unused button would have been better.

Is Assassin's Creed II better than Assassin's Creed? That really depends on what you consider better and what's most important to you. Certain aspects were improved greatly and there are a lot of new features as well, but there are others that have worsened or remained the same. But despite the repetition and flaws of the first game, I'd rather play it again than Assassin's Creed II. It tells a consistently good story, as opposed to only a few missions and the ending of Assassin's Creed II being good, and the platforming isn't nearly as bad. Both games fail at living up to what they try to be, and with the lack of what made the first game bearable in this one, this entry in the series manages to be a generally worse game. Unless you're interested in continuing the series, this game isn't worth trying out, especially if you disliked the first entry.","Some give, some take, and a lot of the same",1337040000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Been with the franchise since the original Medieval, so it holds a special place in my heart.  Like others, Rome 1 was my favorite, so a sequel was going to be amazing in my mind.

Unfortunately this isn't the case.  This game just has too many issues that keep me from enjoying it, both in the campaign map and battle phases.  To start with, I fear Rome 2 may have tried a little too hard to be like Civ V, and many of the same issues raise their heads this time around.  Population happiness will make you want to rip your hair out as it rises and plummets for no particular reason.  City management is very restricted yet complicated at the same time.  The technology tree strives to be that of Civ V and falls very short.  I wish TW had realized the majority of people do not buy these games for the city management aspect--they buy them for the epic battles!  Which leads to the next wave of issues...

Like many other reviews have mentioned, this game's battles basically turn into large blob vs. large blob.  If your blob is stronger, congrats you win.  If you want to win every battle, get a blob of equal size to the enemy, charge their blob with yours, and flank with 1 cavalry unit.  There is no room for tactics or micro-management of units...just blobs smashing against each other.  Even if there was room for the previously mentioned, it would still not be that great because the AI has not improved.  It's not really the developers' fault, as AI can only go so far.  They will occasionally try to flank you, but that's about it.  Same old, same old.

Finally, this might just be me, but I think they tried a bit too hard with the campaign map.  It's huge, which is sweet, but it's super-crowded.  There's 100+ factions this time around, which looks cool at first...until you realize that large groups of them are basically the same faction with a different name.  Since they are so numerous, many of the actual playable factions are forced to start with 1, 2, or 3(if you're lucky) provinces.  In my campaign as the Britons, roughly half of the playable factions were wiped out by ""minor"" factions in the first 40 turns or so.

While the first Force Unleashed was the fastest-selling Star Wars game of all time, it didn't particularly review well, and a staggering number of gamers quickly voiced their frustrations with the game's broken controls, cheesy force graphics and its detrimentally short length.  Still, that game did boast a phenomenal (and canonical) story that fit in perfectly with George Lucas' Star Wars lore.  The game shows the birth of the Rebellion against the Empire at the hands of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, codenamed Starkiller.  Beware of spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished the first game.  There were two outcomes possible...you could kill Vader and end up a mindless slave of the Emperor, or Vader would kill you, effectively making you a martyr and giving strength to the Rebellion.  The Force Unleashed II begins under the assumption that you chose the latter path.  That is its first problem...

With that ending in mind, the story of The Force Unleashed ended...for good.  Lucasarts, however, were put on the spot to create a sequel, and to do that they had to deal with the pesky problem of continuity.  The result is a bland, contrived story that comes nowhere near the splendor of the first game.  Starkiller has been cloned, though it's never quite revealed if he is in face one of the clones.  Once he escapes imprisonment by Vader, the game begins as Starkiller's #1 priority is to find Juno Eclipse, his love interest and former pilot from the first game.  This motivation is played up too often, but comes off as whiny and selfish.  Moreover, the plot never moves on from that, making it fall flat on its face as it basically goes nowhere.  The end of the game features a similar ""light side"" or ""dark side"" ending, so we'll see how that ends up in the hinted-at sequel.  Ah well, the gameplay...

Right off, The Force Unleashed II makes a fantastic first impression!  You're thrust into a thrilling fight to escape the planet of Kamino, with some impressive combat and a couple of awe-inspiring sequences where you're falling down to a platform far below...rain and obstacles coming at you while you use the force to dispose of them.  The combat in this game is ultra-tight and a vast improvement from the first game.  Starkiller is POWERFUL here...almost too powerful.  At your disposal you have twin light sabers (which can also dismember your opponents), the force lightning and the force push.  Soon after, you're given the force repulse, Jedi mind trick and light saber throw ability.  The result is an astonishing array of options for you to wreak havoc at your foes.  New kinds of enemies are introduced at regular intervals in this first level, and you have to figure out how to best defeat them.  Some are immune to force powers, others block all physical attacks.  By the time you finish this first level, it's not hard to feel exhilarated by the action in this game.  Then you hit the second level and do it all again...and again in the third...etc.  You'll fight wave after wave of enemies, but they're all the exact same enemies you fought in the first level.  It never introduces anything new.  After a short while, the game quickly becomes a chore until quite suddenly...it ends.  Yes, this game is short.  So short in fact, it's downright insulting.  You will not get sixty dollars' worth of content here.  On normal, you're looking at 4-5 hours...3 on easy.  There is basically no reason to pay full price for this game...at all.  I would highly recommend giving it a rental instead.

The game's graphics are light years ahead of its predecessor.  I was frequently very impressed with the level of detail and how well the game runs.  You will occasionally run into some minor glitches and see enemies or obstacles floating in mid-air, but it doesn't happen too often.  The pre-rendered cutscenes are immaculate.  Unfortunately the same level of detail wasn't given to level design.  Each level really only has 2 or 3 different ""rooms"", which are repeated ad nauseum until you reach the boss.  Oh yeah...there's only 3 bosses in this game, and only one (the end of level 2) that's really great.  Also, speaking of levels, there's only about 6 of them and most get really boring.  This is because the majority of the game is spent on Kamino (which is grey and rainy) or an orbiting spaceship (which is grey and dark).  There's also a very very brief level on Dagobah (which is grey and jungle-y)...you see where I'm going with this.  Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but the locales chosen for the game are so bland!  Why not follow the example of the first game and give us some variety?  The game's second level is gorgeous...why couldn't we get more of that?

So yes, this is The Force Unleashed II.  It's a fun game at times, but the horrendously short length keeps me from recommending that anyone fork over full price for this game.  It's a shame because the game has so much potential!  But in the end, it comes off as a rushed product.  Whereas the first Force Unleashed had a great story to make up for the poor gameplay, the exact opposite is true of the second game.

For the first time, command Star Wars Imperial and Rebellion units in real time.  The sound is truly the most excellent part of the game; the unit sounds are fantastic, and the metal-ized version of the  Imperial Theme is a nice touch.  Graphics are a bit dated, but I feel  they've done a good job with what they had, using a dated 3D engine.
The  Bad:
The main menu and the user interface for controlling your force  looks extremely tacked-on in a last-minute fashion, and should have been  done much better.  The interface makes controlling units a chore.  This is  a common deficiency in recent LucasArts games, though.  The 3D perspective  takes time to master, and until you do master it, you'll lose alot.  This  combined with the interface reduces you to alot of micromanagement, which  can get problematic.
The worst aspect of the game is how resources are  derived.  The game works on a system of ""command points"", whereby  you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are  succesful in combat.  This sounds like it might have been innovative, but  in this implementation what happens both in the single player and  multiplayer game is that the player (or computer) who wins early skirmishes  gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements, thus quickly  overwhelming their opponent.  This condition, where the outcome is decided  from the start and you've virtually no way to recover from an early falter,  causes frustration and represents to me poor design.
If you are an  absolute freak about Star Wars, you might enjoy this game because you'll be  able to re-enact the battle of Hoth and other scenarios.

Its a mini game collection that is almost the same as the previous game, but with dinosaurs instead of safari animals.  The game requires you to speak into the microphone frequently, shouting a word or phrase in Spanish usually two or three times and these short diversions count towards the title's mini game count.  Riding on the back of a critter and moving either up or down to avoid debris is BACK.  ""Finding a critter through the camera"" is BACK, only this time its dinosaurs.

The graphics are minimal, there are no video clips, only still images from the ""extended episode"" of the tv show that is the game's theme.  The most annoying thing is the pop up still image advertising the Dinosaur Rescue and Nickelodeon after EVERY SINGLE MINI GAME.  Its just advertisement and completely unnecessary.

My four year old enjoyed the game, and was excited over the dinosaur theme, but she finished it by herself without even asking for assistance in under 30 minutes.  She has played it a few times since but gets bored quickly.  It's too similar to the other Diego game and doesn't offer long enough activities to keep her interested.

2.0,False,"04 7, 2010",A2CZBGIJP8TZ1T,B001CMIUYS,Joy,"Okay, This is just going to be a bottom line, to the point review. I have been playing the Final Fantasy series for years and have played just about every Final Fantasy game from FFI and even some off titles like Tactics and Crystal Chronicles. Now, when FFXI came out, I couldn't play it since I refuse to pay every month in addition to paying for the game itself. When FFXII came out, I had mixed feelings but it still had enough stuff in it to make me keep playing and even though it really lacks in story, it's not a complete waste. I still like a lot of it.

So here we are now with Final Fantasy XIII and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, this is NOT Final Fantasy! This is some random bare-bones RPG that someone made that is only a demo of a game. A shell of a game. That's how I feel about this. It's unfinished. This isn't the hard work of Square, the company Square who has always delivered 100 percent into the Final Fantasy series. This isn't the work of that great company who delivered the masterpieces like FFVI, FFVII, FFVIII, FFIX, and FFX. This isn't the company who put tons and tons of hard work into the towns and shops and talking to npc's. Final Fantasy doesn't make you buy items from a save point. Final Fantasy is about going to towns and going into shops and going up to the shopkeeper and buying the items. And this certainly isn't the company who really delivered with battling and gameplay. Fighting is no longer fun. There is no more fun battling enemies anymore.  In FFXII, I accepted the A.I. but enough A.I.! I want to control all my characters!! It's not that hard to ask for, to want to be able to control all my characters in battle. Especially in an offline RPG.

UPDATE: I have to add something here that I also just found out. I found this on another site:

""This also echoes similar comments Kitase made earlier this month, when he said that it's ""very hard to make games on PlayStation 3 in the same style as the games in [FFVII's] era had. Making graphics will take an enormous time."" He explained that's also part of the reason FFXIII is more linear than past Final Fantasy games.""

Okay, What you just read is completely unacceptable and just flat out laziness and stupidity! So because we have amazing graphics, the gameplay has to completely suffer!? I'm sorry but that's just total BS! Excuse my language but this is just completely irresponsible and unacceptable for a gaming company who has always delivered 100 percent in the main series, especially before FFXI released. Now, if I have to sacrifice gameplay for amazing graphics, then I don't want any part of it!! Just bring back the old graphics but I know for a FACT that if they can spend years on graphics alone, then they can deliver an epic FF in every other area! Come on! This is pitiful. Just downright sad and pathetic.

This is just shameful. For about twenty years, Final Fantasy has never let me down. But this game is just a demo, just a demo of another random RPG with the words Final Fantasy on the cover. If this was truly Final Fantasy, I wouldn't be rating it so low and having to write all these things. But it's true, this is no longer Final Fantasy. Everything I have loved about Final Fantasy is gone. Sure, there are chocobos but you can't even ride them until late in the game. The only thing this ""demo"" of a game has going for it is the graphics. That's it. Square are ripping all it's long time fans off and so many people are just buying into it. I will NOT give in to their less than capable work. If and when they return to their roots and give 100 percent of their time and effort into a true Final Fantasy, only then will I support them again.

I know that Final Fantasy XII was a big departure with the totally different battling system and removal of random encounters but for them to completely change everything that made Final Fantasy what it is, well, there's just no excuse. They just became lazy and are making money off of it. Even Final Fantasy X-2 had more effort and work put into it.

When this game came out, it required an Xbox Live account. This wouldn't be a problem, except that Live for the original Xbox is gone. And unlike the Dreamcast and GameCube versions, you HAVE to be connected to Live to even boot up the disc to the main menu. Even offline play requires a connection!

And when it WAS working, you'd be paying around $170 a year to play online, combining the cost of Live in the first place and the purchase of a $10/month license.

The graphics have been around since the original NES - Playstation 1 times probably. There are about 6 different 3D backgrounds, but they still don't add to it.
The menu system could be better, the game doesn't explain it's scoring method or & real quick on instructions on how to use the remote (no nunchuck option). The tutorial for how to play a game can only be accessed after you START a game & decide options which it never explains some of the options that aren't obvious. It does have easy, medium & hard settings. I was hoping/EXPECTING a training option for games, especially chess (I've never played), but beyond a 31 page 1 paragraph text & simple flash graphic example, it does not.
Now, board games are about strategy, right? Well, on ALL games, it highlights ALL possible moves it designates, EVEN on the HARD option.
CLASSIC GAMES
Chess - self-explanatory, simple boring graphics, anything you'd find on a multi game PC title eve up to 10 years ago.
Checkers - I kicked butt on Medium though been too many years since I played. On hard, it kicked my butt. I started remember the strategies... then realized I wanted to make a perfectly fine safe legal move away from other opponents, but it would NOT let me. It wanted me to jump my opponent which would result in my piece getting jumped as well which I didn't want to lose. WHAT KIND OF GAME DOESN""T LET YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN MOVES? Sure it helped to let me know I could do a move I didn't realize, but why limit you to the computer's CHOSEN moves which resulted me in always losing?
Reversi - I can kick butt on this game every time usually because of ONE easy strategy. the boarder titles are KEY & ESPECIALLY corner pieces. it's easy to figure out. But even on HARD the computer couldn't figure that out. Again, it highlights all choices though I don't think there was a limit like checkers. Another issue I think once I hit A (selected) a piece, I could not unselect it so I was stuck.
Backgammon - I forget how to play & the instructions still left me confused, so I did not play.
FAMILY GAMES
Jigsaw Puzzle - very hard pictures like a far away shot of an oil tanker in a cloudless sky in calm water. A dark shadowy sailboat at twilight so it was all in different colors of blue only. A panda surrounded only by bamboo leaves. The pieces move along the bottom like a stock market ticker & you pick it up as it passes. You have to guage where the peice would fit almost perfectly even in the middle even if it's the first piece. OH! & the best part? The indicator in ALL the games is a small hand.. so when you have a piece in your hand, it COVERS it as you rotate it & decide where it fits.
Backgammon - I nver played it, the instructions made it seem like a very boring, with less strategy involved then even checkers. All possible moves were of course highlighted.
Wordcubes/Boggle - make words by selecting letters that touch each other. When play alone, it doesn't even give you a computer opponent like the other games.
Naval Battle/Battleship - graphics circa 1985. Getting bombs to hit took several attempts, it would make the square turn blue if missed & red outline of a square if hit w/sound of explosion. woo hoo. If found the full ship, it would show an outline for a second & then only the outlined red squares again. A faster but more mindless version of the game.
STRATEGY GAMES
Mahjong - I have an old CRT 27"" (I use s-video cable for the wii) & sitting close I had no problem reading characters. I like the game overall, but I find Vista's much more engaging. Any tiles you cannot select because they are blocked are shadowed in grey instead of beige.
Connect Four - just like the board game except they look like red/yellow bulging tires or donuts with graphics from the 1990s.
Sudoku - did not play
Gomoku/Pente - never heard of it before, but played it & loved the style of game.

Some game boards are shown in easy, boring, top down view, some like Gomoku were on an angle to give it a 3D look.
This is another shovelware. The developers like most bad third parties think the secret to casual games is just slap an easy game w/o any attention to details, unique style, etc & consumers will still love it.

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game:
THE GOOD
Finally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.
THE BAD
I was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.
OVERALL
Not recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!  Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this!

I've sunk about 130 hours into it at this point, doing a lot of back and forth saving to try different things, and the most consistent bit seems to be that: nothing matters. Nothing. I went into the last mission with a grand total of one loyalty storyline finished, a planet and a half settled, and still came out of it with with one (scripted) casualty. It wasn't like Mass Effect 2 (which I am slowly realizing was the peak for this franchise and we're never getting that magic back), where if you didn't kit out your Normandy and do your bonding quests with your team, you were walking out of there beaten and bloody and with a long list of names on that memorial.

For all the side quests and things to do in the game... none of it actually matters anyway. You'll just finish the incredibly short main story and go back to doing whatever exploration you were already doing. When you hit the end, it will be obvious that they already have DLC locked and ready to drop as soon as they think they can do it without getting criticized.

I think the biggest disappointment were the boss fights, though. The very first major enemy you will fight is epic, and when I say epic I felt like it was nearly reaching Dark Souls level of enemy design. It felt like Reapers again (which I'm not convinced remnant aren't the infant stages of and history is about to repeat in a new galaxy. Maybe whatever killed the builders is chasing them across the universe and everywhere they set up shop eventually ends up being the birthplace of reapers...)

However, the first boss you fight... will also be the last boss you fight. So by the time you get to that mission you will look up and wonder, ""Uh, didn't I already do this?"" As a result, you'll mow through it because you already know exactly what to expect. One shot. Disappointing.

In all, I'm left wondering how they spent 5 years on this title and came out of it with such lack of attention to detail or design. The storyline is too short, the main antagonist's pinnacle fight was... disappointing, and the one thing that used to be a saving grace - the romance options - was so lackluster I wonder why they even bothered. Unless you plan to play BroRyder and romance either Cora or the new asari, don't expect much. Even the scene that was exclusively for female Ryder looks like it was designed with BroRyder in mind. Suvi is great, but that animation? Yea, no one put the actual female model in there to see how it would look. Coming from Inquisition and the Sera arc... They really should have tapped that team to help with working these animations properly. Or put someone on the job that actually, you know, cared a little about more than just straight BroRyder. I don't care what these other guys on here are saying about SJWs taking over. This was 100% designed to be straight BroRyder first, and everything else an afterthought at best.

Vetra's lock-in scene? Recycled from BroRyder. Check out where her hand lands. Here's a hint - it lands where his cheek would be. The scene with the asari? Yep, recycled again and this time it's almost offensive. No one could take a weekend to watch Lost Girl and learn something about how this actually works?

*shrugs*

The one thing I will say is that at least the responses you give match the dialogue wheel, and there were several times I'd say my own actual response out loud to the screen and then hear my character echo my thoughts precisely. That was refreshing and very well done. More of that, please.

Controls are also very well-done. Transition between controller and  keyboard\mouse is seamless. I'd use the controller for the fun exploration parts and swap back to the precision tool for the fights. This was done very, very well and I hope they continue including the controller scheme in the PC version.

So in the end, it was mildly enjoyable for what it was, derivative storyline and all (Crystalline Entity and Borg, anyone?). I'd still suggest giving this a pass until it hits the bargain bin, and in hindsight I wouldn't have preordered it. I will not be preordering the next Mass Effect, at least not unless they acknowledge some of the more egregious issues and build trust back up with us that they are correcting them.

If you are considering this for the PC, read the above thread first.  This is a terrible port.  The graphics might be great, the story might be good (I don't know this to be true) but the UI and controls are abysmal on the PC.  If you were expecting the series to return to the direction of DAO, this game does not.  If you were looking forward to the tactical camera, you will be disappointed.  If you expected them to put in any effort at all to distinguish the PC version from the console versions in terms of controls or UI, they didn't.

If you don't mind DAI being an action RPG, go for it, probably not the worst $60 you can spend.  I would get a console version though, if you have any PC gamer roots at all because this game will disappoint you just in terms of what could have been.

2.0,False,"01 29, 2011",A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B0030F1DOO,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"This game is the biggest disappointment for Playstation 3 ever. I loved the original Force Unleashed, it had both stunning visuals, amazing force effects and a great story. This game to have great visuals and some good force effects, the problem is that there is hardly any story, for the simple reason of the game just being so extremely short. Now in the original part of the fun was unlocking all of the Apprentice's cool force powers, you sort of do some unlocking here to, but the game is just to short for any type of character development.

Let me try to illustrate how short this game is. My and my hubby played through the entire game in 3 and a half hours, and let me tell you that we are not good players, we play for the story so a real gamer could probably do it in one and a half hours. Now I know what you are thinking with a storyline so short there have to be multi player, different game play modes, anything to make this game's entertainment value last for more than a few hours, well no there is not, there are a few challenges and a handful of trophies to unlock and that is it. When we finished this game and the credits begun to roll me and hubby actually tried to restart from the last checkpoint as we first believed there had to be some glitch, that it was not possible for a full prized Playstation 3 game to be this short, when we realized there where no glitch we just felt cheated. Yes that is right, I would go so far as to call this game a scam to harvest money of the popularity of the first game while providing no content for the second one.

To be fair to the game I have to add that what there is of the game is good, the graphics are beautiful, the sort storyline is good, the controls work wonderfully and had this been a download off Playstation store or a budget title sold as a add on story to the first game then I would have had no problems with it, but that they dare to charge full price for this claiming that it is a full game, that is just an insult to players.

If you can find this game very cheaply it might be worth having for the short but good story, or if you can find it for rent you might enjoy it. However be aware that this is not a full game. I have never seen a modern game this short, this game is an attempt to milk money out of fans of the first game while putting in minimal effort.

2.0,False,"05 1, 2011",A291R54MXR0ZFL,B0047TG2R0,Dylan McGregor,"After playing the game through twice and reading the bulk of both positive and negative comments what is certainly clear is that DA2 shares the title name and that's about it. People who didn't play or like the first one or didn't have the patience to finish it are generally going to like a fast paced button masher while RPG players prefer a more complex system and more customization and detail of their characters for a more involved experience. In other words, it pretty much depends on the type of gamer you are. A lot of people called it Dragon Age for dummies or that the whole thing was ""dumbed"" down. When I first played it I thought the same thing, again because it shared the title. After completing it twice I think that it's more of a completely different game. The gameplay is simple compared to DAO, but it's so different I can't even consider it a ""version"" of the old system. I found it boring, repetitive, and very linear. Trying to hold an RPG element to a button masher isn't a bad idea, but if they are going to do that then they should have revamped it all the way to an action/platformer game with a jump and duck button and those annoying Tomb Raider type puzzles to solve. Instead there is just enough of the old system drawn in this game to make it very clunky and generally piss off fans of the first game.

A note on the Mass Effect 1 and 2 comparisons: while Mass Effect 2 was simplified in both weaponry and skill trees, the gameplay itself stayed true as far as the aim and shoot engine and the tightening up of the biotics and tech powers were a welcome addition for me since I really like using them in combat. While the system itself was tightened and simplified the game itself held to its origins with a great story, a fun adventure, epic heroes, great DLC content, and a strong and firm grasp to the first game. The things that made ME2 such a great sequel are all but absent in DA2.

Although I found the gameplay lacking and the monotonous environments and bogus side-quests annoying like every body else, my real beef with the game is the story itself. Even if I was playing this game with no knowledge of the first one the story and the characters were very poor. Without the ability to even change my party's armor I became less and less associated with the characters. Towards the end of the game I simply didn't care about any of them including Hawke. The simplified response wheel made social developement with the other characters feel more like an old true or false questionnaire. I could care less about their personalities or feelings as long as I was able to follow the exact process of choices to make sure they were in my party when I needed them, NPC mannequins with various combat abilities and nothing else. However, since I am a big fan of DAO this game had no meaning to me at all other than frustration and let down. A couple cameo appearances and a shared title in no way makes this a distinguished sequel of one of my favorite games of all time.

If you have never played DAO, or prefer a platform style game with a fantasy element then you may very well like this game and get a lot more out of it than those of us who expected something more conforming to our expectations of a sequel.

If you really liked Origins then I can't really recommend DA2 because of the drastic changes in both gameplay and story. However, if you have the urge to at least try it once like I did then I recommend waiting for a used copy for relatively cheap somewhere on down the line or maybe borrow it from a friend if you can.

I will begin this review like so many before me by saying that I am a long time fan of Bioware products.  I have simply loved every RPG they've made since the original Baldur's Gate.  Even after the extraordinary let down of this expansion I still hold out that Bioware is one of the top tier game developers out there.  Now, that said lets get to why this expansion isn't worth your time or money.

Character Development:

This has to be one of the most prevalent issues with this game.  Dragon Age: Origins was rich with story and character background, not only yours, but that of your companions.  It actually took time throughout your playthrough of the game to get to know your comrades in arms, and it was actually quite easy for me as the players to get so immersed that I found myself actively liking and disliking them.  This however is not the case for Awakening.

A lot of people have commented on how lame the Orlesian Grey Warden is, due to his lack of ""Origin"".  Well I will counter, not really different from your imported character.  After recently finishing DA:O Awakening I feel I can say this with a fresh memory of what I've just experienced and honestly, nothing you do in DA:O transfers over to Awakening with the exception of who you put on the throne, and even that might be altered drastically depending on the romances you set up in DA:O.  So honestly, my opinion onthe Orlesian...  Great idea.  Allows those who just picked up Awakening by accident not realizing DA:O was the original to play through without having to start at level 1 and miss what new content was added for this expansion.

As for your new party members.  I just didn't care for any of them, with the exception of one familiar face.  Each on of them felt like they were trying to rush themselves into my character (and my own) affections.  In most cases my character knows these people less than a day and they're already best friends.  Felt hackneyed.  Hated it.

Added Content:

This was another major disappointment for me.  This expansion pack actually felt like it was taking more away from the original than adding.  You're confined to Ameranthine.  There is no going outside of Ameranthine.  You just have...  Ameranthine...  And while they do a decent enough job of trying to fool you into believing this is a large new land to explore...  It simply isn't.  In fact, not only is is small, its also boring!  Its every generic landscape thats been in every B-rated RPG for the past ten years!  I wasn't wowed once by any of the locales.

I would've loved to been able to explore the rest of Fereldan, see how my actions affected it, check out the gradual rebuild of Denerim and Redcliffe, alas, I'm stuck in dusty old Ameranthine.

The new specializations aren't all that great either. With the exception of the two new rogue specializations I didn't find the other four to be all that useful.  The new skills really didn't affect the outsome of any of my battles either with the exception of increased hardiness.

Now this brings up a MAJOR beef of mine.  The new Runecrafting, and, well, other crafting abilities.  For some reason, the people of Ameranthine, they can't make anything on their own!  Holy crap!  I LOATHE crafting, in any game, HATE IT!  While its a horrendous affair in most games, Awakening has given me a all new hatred for this game mechanic.  Not only do you have to craft all your own ruins, and the majority of the more effective potions, BUT you have to do so under the confines of your extremely limited inventory space which naturally I didn't waste my character's talent points on runecrafting so I had to suffer through loading screens every time I wanted to make new runes but would run out of materials (due to not having enough inventory space) and have to return to the shop to get more blank runestones to go out and suffer another loading screen to make my runestones again.

Now you might ask, why even go through all that trouble?  They make it kinda mandatory.  In order to get the weapon weapon in the game, well, you gotta make runestones.  CURSE YOU BIOWARE!  Ahem...  Sorry.

As for weapons and armor, while they did recieve a texturing update to most of the new sets that made them look quite attractive, there are no new models to speak of so you're still looking at the same armor types as you did throughout your whole DA:O experience.  Not a big deal really, but for the price I expected more.

Story:

Its a decent enough plot.  Rushed, short, but decent.  I imagine though everything that happened in this expansion will merely be a footnote in the next expansion.  Can't really say a lot here without any spoilers so I'll leave it at that.

Overall Experience:

Not not worth the $40 pricetag.  At best this is a $20 expansion, and even then I feel like thats stretching it.  My recommendation if you absolutely must play this game is to either rent (easily beaten in the usual rental timeframe), or wait until you can find a used copy for $20 or less.  Not a bad idea really considering I predict before the year is out they'll be releasing another expansion to tie up the whole Darkspawn/Grey Warden storyline.  Not really part of my review, but my money is on Dragon Age 2 being set in Tevinter and no I don't think they'll be importing characters from DA:O (which isn't really a bad thing considering my Grey Warden started his adventure in his thong with this import).",Unfortunate Disappointment,1276214400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Forget God of War.  God of War's specific button presses were integrated to a point that you felt you actually achieved something.  It happened often enough that you were ready for it but not so often that you wanted to go 80's metal with your controller.

Conan lets you get relaxed and start to enjoy the mindless slaughter and then BOMBARDS you with that crap.  The final boss battle?  I have never NEVER returned a video game early...until I rented this one.  It's a trend that I'm starting to notice with newer video games, unfortunately.  You still have a gem every once in awhile but it seems that, more and more, companies are relying on the system WAY too much.  Here's an idea, video game worker people, forget about the system and make a GOOD GAME.  I don't care that the flowers are pretty if they smell like raw sewage.

Thomas Kinkaid could paint a little perfect pile of dog poo surrounded by cottage-ey snow covered perfection with a little poem running down the side of it written by John Ashbery explaining how that in another reality the poo is our childhood imagination and then have a little digital box on the side of the picture that plays the voice of James Earl Jones reading the poem and in the end it would still be just a pile of crap.

In the end...that's really what this game is.  A pile of dog poo.  You may get to walk through a pretty yard and play with a few decent toys, but it's not worth the cost of admission and the nasty smell that will follow you around for awhile.

I have been playing this game for a month and this what I think:

1) AWFUL guns selection! it sucks! You will have the option to choose 1 of 6 guns they offer you for each character (mechanic, professional,etc). Weapon accuracy is really bad! There are like 5 good guns in this entire game!
Sniper guns and hand-guns are the worst!

I don't know about you, but I will like to custom my own guns (paint them, attach 2 flash-light, knife, etc)

2) Maps. Some of them are really boring and everyone play as sniper in few of them!
Some map are really hard to enjoy cause they are really small. During night time, there are like 4 maps available to play multiplayer.
And if you want to play more maps, you gotta spend another $40-50 dollars to unlock the super mega ""premium"" edition!

3) Now you can open-close doors, get in building, houses and drive cars, GREAT! I like this! There is one map where you can actually have sandstorm, love it! Battle-field needs to add more weather condition. Zip-lane are cool!

4) Playing multiplayer is not the greatest experience! You may not like to fly helicopter from the outside view cause it lags 1-2 seconds.
No more F-18 planes (GREAT)! Transport helicopter still sucks, the pilot can't shoot or do something!

5) Base rape! You can't do this anymore here (I am 90% sure) which bothers me because now you can have a sniper close to his base and you can't go and kill him (manually). You gotta shoot him somehow from too far away!

What do they need to fix or adjust?
Criminal concept is good but they rushed to much to release this game! They did not add to much gun options and they are not accurate.
Still make me mad that you can't take medic package as a sniper or mechanic! Really hard to kill sniper if he is too close to his base! Hard to see an enemy if he is on the roof. I would like to see a type of drones so you can hit some areas with missiles.

I find myself wonder what the heck is this? The city of Fairhaven is great, I like the detail and exploration, it reminds me of Skyrim in its detail. My problem is with the gameplay.

Firstly, there is no car handling, you cant even tweak it or sensitivity. The cars are all over the place and handle like garbage.

You cant skip them and by the time the animations finish playing, your in last place again. Real fun.

All in all, if you want to race, look elsewhere. This is a crash simulator not even a arcade racer. If you skip racing and just drive around crashing into things and exploring the city, it is fun and enjoyable, albeit shallow experience.

2.0,False,"12 29, 2013",A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B00DBRM3G8,Enlightened,"For the past 5 years the NBA2K franchise has been my favorite gaming franchise.  With a product that kept improving every year and addictive gameplay it seemed 2KSports could do no wrong.

With the leap to next gen systems, however, it seems as though 2KSports have forgotten about the fundamentals.  The number one reoccurring problem with the NBA franchise is the offensive rebounding.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why this hasn't been fixed.  You could have Shaq, Dennis Rodman and LeBron James on your team crashing the offensive glass and still get pounded on the offensive boards.  It's abysmal, it's laughable, it causes you to lose games, it causes you to put down the controller.  Pressing the jump button does nothing as your player fails to jump for the rebound.  Rebounding is just unresponsive and it's so bad that it causes you to lose games and that's where you draw the line.

Passing the ball is STILL horrible.  You often throw passes past the open guy under the basket to the guy that's covered in the corner that 100% of the time gets stolen.  Grown men still throw these soft rainbow passes like they are in the third grade that always gets stolen.  There's no reason an NBA player can't pass the ball with some zip and force on it.  None whatsoever.  Pass the ball like a full grown 6'9 225 lb human being that's been playing basketball all of his life not like a 5'2 100lb third grader.  It's ridiculous in the NBA players can't throw a 5 foot chest pass to a teammate without it getting stolen or tipped.  Too many times this results in turnovers simply because the guy is open if they throw real a pass and not the BS pass the game makes you throw.  This mechanic allows defenses to get back on shooters, defenders clearly out of position have time to get back and get the steal.  It's atrocious.  This is supposed to be next generation.

The instant replay is as terrible as it's ever been.  Needs a complete overhaul.  Enough said on that.

You cannot create a player.  Yes you read that correctly.  I cannot open a menu and create a random player in 20-freaking-14.  The PS4 (and this game) came out November 2013 at $400 and $60 respectively.  Why on EARTH can I not create players?????  While we're on the subject...you can no longer create teams either.  While still on the subject of creation, you can barely edit rosters and draft classes and when you do you're forced to save them to the 2K server instead of on your console's hard drive...WHERE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.  So guess what...when the servers go down (as they do frequently and lengthily) you can't even edit your rosters or draft classes (more on this later).  UNACCEPTABLE.

The developers force you to create a MyPlayer before the game loads up and even so you cannot change the player's appearance.  The game comes pre-loaded with about 15 faces.  I've read somewhere that these are the developer's faces and if so I just don't see the need for them to be TROLLS.  Let the user customize their own faces!! I just don't get it.

When creating a draft class you can't change the player's face nor skin complexion.  Instead you have to scroll and scroll and scroll until you find a guy that KINDA looks like how you want him to look.  You can't add tattoos...it's just a true travesty what happened to the CAP, Create A Team, and draft class.  They would have done better just completely taking it out of the game then present this farce to the public.

You STILL can't edit ages of NBA players therefore you still can't play with a 19 year old KG or Vince Carter.  The only way is to try to create one in a draft class but oh yeah...you can't edit appearances so yeah...can't do it.  It seems like an entire decade went ignored when it comes to classic players and teams.  There's a few players you can play with from the 2000s in their younger form such as Tim Duncan, Shaq, Kobe, & Allen Iverson.  They weren't the only great players from their eras though.  Can I get some T-Mac and Yao Ming?  Can I get some Nash & Stoudemire??  Can I get some Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin??  Chris Webber???  2004 Pistons???

I understand that a lot of the stars from that era are in the game.  Players like Vince Carter, Ray Allen, KG, Amare Stoudemire and the like are in the game as old players about to retire or as scrubs.  This of course would be a moot point if you could just EDIT THE PLAYER'S AGES which you cannot.  Reggie Miller, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Charles Barkley are still not on the rosters to everyone's amazement.  If you can get MICHAEL JORDAN then I don't see how you cannot get those very essential players into the game.  Get it done.  Instead of doing that they chose to focus on Euro-League teams that really in the grand scheme of things nobody cares about.  Sure, it's a nice touch but I don't need those teams.  Give me the NBA players and teams past and present not some players that can't or won't make NBA teams.

What really gets 2K player's blood boiling is a little something called VC.  First off, I'm not opposed to the idea of VC.  It's a basic build up points to upgrade system.  The problem lies in the amount of VC you get for playing the game versus the amount of VC things cost.  To sum it up, basically I have to play three or four games to get enough VC to be able to change my lineup in MyGM.  SAY WHAT???  Everything costs around 1000 VC on average and trust me you don't earn that much for playing through a basketball game.  I'm a patient gamer and trust me I've tried to ""bank"" VC but it just doesn't work.  Want to make a trade because the owner will get unhappy?? That will cost you 1400 VC and the reward you get for completing the owner's goal is  a lousy 100 VC.  You might as well make the owner unhappy.  Want to send your rookie to basketball camp???  1400 VC.  A quick sidenote...you can still only send a player to one camp per year.  That's so stupid. To add to that, they've taken out the ability to improve during the season via drills.  Back on the subject, simply earning VC by playing the game won't get you enough VC to actually do anything significant.

Every mode pulls from the same VC account so you are frequently low on VC.  That's where the developers (or the people in charge) decided that was a place to cash in.  Of course you can buy VC!  Why didn't I think of such genius???  For the low low price $10 US you can get 35000 VC!  That's right folks....$400 for the console, $60 plus tax to prove that I own NBA 2K14 and another $10 just so I can play the game with any competence.  I just can't wait to buy more VC!!  Your VC is saved on NBA 2K's servers that go down frequently and lengthily (did the record skip???).  When the servers are down you can't earn VC.

2K Servers.  Completely unacceptable.  The servers go down frequently and lengthily (it feels like I've said that before) and you CANNOT PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET!  MyGM, MyCareer, MyTeam are completely useless when the server is down.  The only mode available is Quick Game.  I repeat...after shelling out $60 for the game, if the servers go down (something completely out of your control), you may as well use the disc as a coaster until the servers get back up.

There's also some minor issues that don't necessarily detract from the game but are noticeable and add up.  Players fall through the goal, fail to react to lose balls and don't move without the ball.  Your players frequently will be dribbling and just lose the ball, too many kicked balls, too many deflections on the pass, too many missed bunnies, too many missed free throws on A releases, there's a lot of contact and ""riding"" going on on defense, moving screens are too frequent, the steal animation is still terrible resulting in this unrealistic lunge that takes you completely out of the play.  I understand the ""you reach I teach"" philosophy I truly do but it's not a reach it's a LUNGE when all they really have to do is swipe at the ball.  While on the subject for some reason double tapping the steal button results in intentional fouls.

It's not all bad.  The graphics are phenomenal and is most likely the best looking thing on the PS4 so far.  Some players do look a little funny (CP3, Jeff Teague, Jamal Crawford, Glen Davis) but for the most part the players look like themselves.  The players don't float on the court anymore and gameplay overall is more fluid.  The commentary is great as usual but it may be time to retire Clark Kellogg or at least have him record some new material.  The crowds are alive and they react to things that happen on the court.  It's probably the best crowd I've ever experienced in a game.  There's finally a noticeable speed and quickness difference amongst the players.  Their still isn't a noticeable height or weight difference though.  For example Shaq looks like a regular center instead of a massive human being.  The post game and halftime interviews are a nice touch and could be the start of something beautiful.

The myriad of problems makes it so that you can't enjoy the game fully though.  There's a lot of frustration to be had if you spend a little time with the game.  Back in the day recommending NBA 2K was a no brainer but as is I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  Being this game was the sole reason I bought a PS4 at launch, after spending a month and half playing the game, I'm thinking I could have waited until 2k15 because it's simply not worth the upgrade.",Enough is Enough...This is an unacceptable and incomplete project,1388275200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Like MM7 before it, Mega Man 8 suffered quite a bit of backlash, and this time around it was a result of the rather unbecoming 16-bit-ish graphical structures on the 32-bit wonders of the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation, and, if you ask me, it was not the title to follow the monstrous Mega Man X4 that came out around the same time.  Still, for all the weeping against statues, MM8 still serves up some classic Mega Man fun with that new-school Mega Man X feel.  The searching for hidden items becomes more important and challenging this time around, the action is still consistently hectic, and the level designs are pretty nicely done with some rich and vivid color work.  However, there's a very cheesy, sugar-coated appeal to this, even more so than MM7 (which, I think, was trying to emulate the American animated series); that and the bosses and weapons don't seem as good as they could have been, Rush's abilities aren't as important as they used to be, and the voice acting is atrocious for certain characters (Dr. Light, Bass, and some of the bosses are the prime sinners in this regard...and Rush Shiraishi did a better job voicing X in X4 than she did Mega Man in this.

Final Fantasy XII is essentially an MMORPG with the online element removed, but still retains the riveting action of drying paint in MMORPG glory!  Final Fantasy XII had great promise, but fell short a couple thousand miles.  This game was all eye candy and no story! When watching the game's opening, you'll think you're in for one HELL of a treat (I certainly did!), but as the story ""progresses"", you'll have this nagging voice in the back of your mind, asking, ""Hey, when is this game going to START?"" and a truck load of back tracking and useless quests that would have Silent Hill 4's Henry Townsend  feel badly for you! I'll try my best to condense this review.
First, let's review the pros:

Pros:

-Gorgeous FMVs and graphics

-A talented and skilled cast of voice actors (kids, believe it or not, there's a world of difference between ""bad voice acting"" and your opinion of whether or not a particular actor's voice fits the character)

-Balthier.  This character was a real card--and about the only character  that was ""alive"" in this snore-fest. Take Balthier out, and this game would have NOTHING!

-Customizable characters.  No more archetypical, spineless, female white or black magic users that are killed by weak enemies! Now they can raise hell with battle axes and guns! GET SOME!

Cons:

-The story.  Where the HELL is the story? When your television is graced with the game's introduction, you'll get pumped and truly believe you're going to receive a colossal bang for your buck! A truly legendary tale full of war, sacrifice, honor..you know-all that good stuff. These expectations begin to fizzle 45 minutes into the game.  The military occupation of Dalmasca by the ""mighty"" Archadian Empire feels about as tense and menacing as...cardboard. Their presence is hardly even noticed! The developers attempted to add some political intrigue in there, but they seem to have forgotten about it in exchange for pointless side quests and some other equally flat villain that was ""BEHIND THE SCENES!1!11!"". Some particular characters decide to stab you in the back for no reason whatsoever.  Konami's Suikoden II (a PS1 game) did a much better job than these guys in terms of a tyrannical enemy occupation.

-The Characters. With the exception of Balthier and Ashe, none of these characters were memorable. They were all flat and one dimensional with virtually no interaction with one another. For example, what was the depth of Balthier and Fran's relationship? If you were to write out the other characters in your party, you wouldn't even miss them. I assumed Vaan was supposed to be the main protagonist, but he was suddenly tossed to the back seat for Ashe and Balthier, and was only given a few lines after that.  A few other characters were thrown in (Al-Cid, The Judges, Archadian Senate), but really had not purpose either. (Even Fran seemed pissed off about this game!)

-Battle System. Was too damn slow for my tastes.

-Music.  Whomever this new person is, they're surely no Uematsu or Sugiyama!

-Licensing Board.  This is truly a double edged sword.  Whereas I liked customizing my characters, having to get a ""license"" via the licensing board just to equip a friggin' HELMET will get on your nerves.

Because of certain negative factors that plagued this game, I feel that this title was rated with a double standard, simply because ""Final Fantasy"" is in the name.  If this were a regular run of the mill RPG, I'm sure it would have been graded harshly.","Five, even FOUR stars?",1193702400,13,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Sure, it's fun (and almost surreal) to see nightmare Zero chasing you.  But it's just isn't challenging (it's ANNOYING) when they turn out the lights, making it impossible to see during certain levels (well, you can stand there long enough and wait for enemies to hit you first...)  Now I find myself having to restart the ENTIRE game because I didn't play the levels in the ""correct"" order since w/o boots for better jumps, I can't advance.. and yet with the Nightmare system on, I can't get the upgrades due to a) a big sliver block blocking my way to the capsule b)icy blocks impossible to advance unless I have a longer air dash ability c)I can't see a thing in the dark!

Everyone has been raving about the ""owner/dynasty"" modes as being so deep and realistic.  Basically, what the game has is every major league team plus AAA, AA, and A teams also included.  This sounds great when you consider there is a disabled list, contract negotiations, and personalities to deal with.  The problem, and IMO, it's a game breaking problem.....they don't have any waivers, options, or call-up send-down rules.  I am baffled that people can find this to be a realistic simulation of running a baseball team.  You can send players down to the minors one day then bring them back up the next.  Essentially, you have access to a full 25 man roster on all four teams, giving you 100 players to use EVERYDAY.  That is insanely stupid.  Forget about a five man rotation folks, say hello to a forty man rotation.  EA Sports took the time to add all of these minor league affiliates and didn't spend any time adding basic and necessary rules.

To say I'm being nit picky is really turning a blind eye here.  At the very least they could have added one realistic rule to fix this problem.  Even if you want to skip waivers and options, they could have made you keep players in the minors for at least two weeks after being sent down (a real MLB rule).  That would prevent havig complete access to your minors everyday.  Very simple, yet EA didn't bother with it.  Who cares about the gameplay when the owner/dynasty modes are 100% unrealistic and stupid.  Big deal, they have a disabled list.

The little forest environment does its job well...along with the first time you enter the city where the humans live.  After that, though, it's back to the good ol' classic Killzone environments.  Dull metallic ships and cities will be waiting for you for the rest of the game.  These sections don't look much better than a PS3 game.

The story is stupid and so boring you won't even care.  I guess there are some out there who are invested in the Killzone mythos....but I do not see how.  More crap about the Hellgahns and humans fighting a never ending war.  And something about a half-breed chick...whose ""half-breed-dom"" doesn't really amount to anything.  Eh.  Just watch the ending on youtube for the ""twist""...if you wanna call it that.

The gameplay was ok.  The game is far more fluid than the last Killzone I played.  (Killzone 2).  You don't feel like you're an overweight slob plodding around when you run and perform actions.  There are some VERY tedious sections where I died many times that were just not fun.  Also some sections seem to place very overwhelming odds against you out of nowhere.  You will end up depending on the ""owl"" to revive you but be let down many times due to its need to recharge after just being used to put up a shield or stun an enemy 30 yards away from you.  Enemies would also spawn RIGHT BEHIND ME in an area or room that I just cleared 2 seconds ago. And for the love of God...don't make me remember the HORRIBLE free fall sections (there are about 3 of them) and that stupid escort the Dr. mission.  Jesus Christ those had to be some of the worst gaming experiences in my game-playing history.  It is also easy to get lost in the game...not in the good way, unfortunately.  There were many times were I simply did not know what to do or how to get from point A to B due to the level design and lack of direction.  None of it was fun...it just made me wanna get to the end and get it all over with.

There are a few glitches in the game.  Sometimes button presses didn't register, leading to quite a few deaths.  There was an audio bug that kept the owl's recharging sound playing for about 30 minutes until i reached a checkpoint auto save so I could completely close the game and reload it.  For some reason, when bombs blew up around me my characters field of view would shift up to the sky for no reason and completely disorient me.  Enemy AI is tough overall, but is still pretty stupid at times.

2.0,False,"02 4, 2015",A2ZW8FZTH5U1BE,B00CH9253W,K. F.,"Mario Party: Island Tour is an extremely disappointing entry in the Mario Party lineup, especially when compared to its predecessor, the vastly superior Mario Party DS. While Nintendo has a tradition of taking two steps forward, one step back with their long-running franchises, Island Tour is more like one step sideways, two steps back.

Island Tour eschews the traditionally Mario Party formula in favor of race boards. While older Mario Party games had you travelling around the board for a fixed number of turns, the goal in Island Tour is generally to be the fastest to reach the finish line. This concept sounds interesting at first, but it quickly becomes apparent that it utterly cripples the game, making Island Tour a hollow shell of the franchise, with about as much depth as a playing card.

Let me review some of the downsides to Island Tour's ""race-to-the-finish"" boards:
*You cannot adjust the number of turns a game will last
*2v2 team play has been removed - no more teaming up with your significant other to battle the CPUs
*There are no 2v2 or 1v3 minigames
*Most boards do not have items - no more hexing your opponents or warping to a different spot on the board
*Gameplay is significantly more random
*The first player in the turn order has a massive advantage

Adjustable-length games and team play were key features of earlier titles. You could make any board last any length of time by adjusting the number of turns. In Island Tour, wanting a game of a certain length locks you into a few boards - if you want to play a short 20-minute game, you're stuck with one of the two pure-luck boards, which are a complete waste of time. Each board in Mario Party DS was detailed and lovingly crafted, with its own unique twist on the gameplay, because the developers knew you might spend hours at a time on one board. In Island Tour, most boards were made to last around half an hour and no longer - they might be pretty to look at, but they lack the memorable features and unique hazards we've come to expect out of Mario Party boards. Themed special event spaces are replaced with generic ""swap all of the players' positions"" spaces and little else.

Island Tour is balanced to be far too random; luck has always played an important part in Mario Party games, but skill is heavily downplayed in Island Tour - even in the board rated maximum skill and minimum luck, my girlfriend and I both consistently feel that our actions are meaningless and victory lies entirely in the hands of chance. Decision making is almost entirely removed from the equation - no traps, no cool items, hardly any forks in the road. Many of the boards are intentionally designed to be random, with everything coming down to the die rolls. You generally earn some type of booster for winning minigames, but a 3x booster is useless if you roll a 0, not to mention all of the boosters in the world won't guarantee you victory on these boards. Each board is scattered with scramble spaces that will change all of the player's positions in some way. In some games we found that a player landed on a scramble space nearly every turn; your progress and use of boosters is meaningless if everyone's positions keeps getting scrambled.

Regardless of how everyone plays, the player who rolled highest at the start is usually going to win. As usual in the series, everyone rolls a die at the beginning to determine turn order. Here's the problem - if the game ends as soon as anyone reaches the finish line, the first player has a distinct advantage, since they have the earliest opportunity to reach it. In the previous Mario Party titles, the turn order rarely mattered - everyone got to take the same number of turns, and any time someone nabbed a star, a new one appeared immediately. In Island Tour, I've found that the first player wins more than half of the time.

The unlockables this time around are a joke - you can buy a tiny 3D portrait for each character and level that comes with a sound board. Really, Nintendo? I didn't even think sound boards were exciting when I was 10.

Island Tour does have some pretty fun minigames, but the same can be said of every entry in the series, so it's not much of a selling point.

Mario Party: Island Tour is perhaps the weakest game in the series (not including the single-player Mario Party Advance), a title only suited for very young players with no experience in the series, or those who prefer skill to be taken out of the equation. If you want a mobile Mario Party game, get Mario Party DS - I guarantee you will be playing it long after you would have tossed out Island Tour.",A huge step backward compared to Mario Party DS,1423008000,2,,

2.0,False,"02 17, 2010",AVVIJ7EBPS4EI,B000VL6OWG,Dave,"First off - the graphics are amazing. The graphics engine supports visually stunning landscapes and both the player and non-player characters are crafted with loving care and attention to detail (if you buy this definitely look closely at the monsters you are fighting, the level of detail on each is impressive). Along with this you have such things as fluid cloth animation, physics for hair that moves and depending on wind and movement. What is nice is that this is a very efficient graphics engine as well, and though many people will eventually be bogged down in a large pvp battle, a recent moderate system will run this game with all settings on maximum easily. Don't look too closely though. Circles are actually octagons, the landscape looks like EverQuest from 1990. There's no such thing as ""rounded"" straight angles and lines on the landscape, everywhere. Oh, and though the armor is amazing, both in design and graphical quality, it is of a sort of anime nature, so the women aren't wearing much and the guys look like mechs. Since the Armor is actually separate models than your character and not just skins it both looks far more impressive than most games (and the pieces match, unlike the clown gear of WoW) and it also suffers from the straight line effect. Triangular breasts and square pants are in store if you don't zoom out after making your initial observations.

But graphics aren't everything, no matter how much the graphics and the customization of character and even equipment might appeal, there needs to be something else. Aion got a couple of things spot on - the skill chains are an interesting way to add some complexity to the normal one-two-three of many games. Note that depending on your class and situation this just means a one-two-two-two-three button press i.e. because of the way the skill chain works, it many times simply activates, the player clicks through, and you move on to your next skill or skill chain.

Crafting is another big point in this game - if you can gather one type of material, you can gather all similar types (i.e. metals, foods, fibers, ect. form one skill) which makes it much more interesting and easy to skill up gathering skills and to support multiple professions. Each character has the ability to master two trade skills and another to a lesser degree. The items made from this process are very useful and often times better than the items that (very rarely) drop in the game. Anyone who enjoys this aspect of games might find Aion a nice home. Also, you do gain experience from tradeskills and gathering, so while it is not a viable way to level, you don't completely give up gaining levels when you tradeskill.

So why the low rating? Because, after having played it for several weeks I can see why people in many reviews talk about a ""lack of content"". The fact of the matter is that the game space and world is fairly small. You won't notice this until you're at least level 30, but it becomes quite apparent after that. There are limited areas to quest at any level, limited places to get loot or drops, ect. The first instance you have access to is at level 25 with a 18 hour lockout time. Did I mention you'll probably leave with one to two green drops that you can sell for relatively little money? No loot unless you're really, really lucky. You can't come back here after level 28 either. While instances getter better past this point, it's nothing many players of MMOs will be used to.

Quests also practically stop after level 26, at least as a means of gaining gear or experience. By the time you complete most quests you will have better gear than the rewards and usually killing one to two mobs will equal the quest experience reward. Of course, the quests usually are simply ""kill 25 of ___"" ... and many of these quests are repeatable, over a hundred times. So you can make what people call ""grinding"" a little more rewarding, even though running back to the quest giver to turn in and reacquire the quest is probably a waste of killing/experience time. If you buy this game with the WoW game mechanic and theory in mind - you're going to be severely disappointed within your first couple of days playing.

There is no escape from pvp. And pvp in this game means being killed while doing the above mentioned grinding. If you don't mind this, it's the game for you. If you want to level up and do it to other people, buy it! But for many this will become a massive source of frustration and annoyance. When it takes you 8 hours of killing individual mobs to level up, and you have two places to do this in, when a higher level player decides you're not going to use that area, it's game over for the day. Seriously, you *will* be killed, over and over again while trying to level up. You will not even have a chance to fight back either since even if the person is you're level (which they won't be) they have come prepared to pvp, so better gear, potions, scrolls ect are at their disposal to ensure that you die and they escape.

***Parents*** If you are considering this game for a child be aware that after level 10 the player enters the one and only channel that connects the entire server together - LFG. This channel is used for chat, selling of goods, and people actually looking for groups. This chat is most times, if not always, littered with racism, sexism (extreme), graphic sexual content, vulgarity, and plenty of complaining, whining and arguing. Since this is the only channel to effectively look for a group in, you're pretty much subject to this no matter what. You will have to read it, you will be exposed to it.

The player base is really an issue, since this is an MMO it's all about the collective experience and a game that is based (aside from all that grinding) on social activity and interaction. I've found most people to be reasonable and many times interesting once you get a legion or a group, but a very large portion of the people that still actually play this game are generally speaking very self involved, unhelpful, aggressive and rude. If you've played World of Warcraft in an Alliance battleground...this is the same thing, all the time, and much, much worse.

I don't really want to say don't buy this game, because I really like a lot of the aspects of it, and I'd like to see the community grow ( and mature) so that the game can continue to develop and expand into a more finished title. At the same time, if you have a tight budget, and realize that this game means continuing to pay each month that you play it, I don't want anyone else to buy it like me, to at first think -""what are all these reviews on various websites and especially the game website about? This is great""  It's not. Period. The game is Korean made, and there will not be two versions for a North American audience with different tastes. The game has been out for a year prior to it's North America release, so anyone that says it is a new game is confused. The game has been in a released format for over a year.
Unless you really love ""ganking"" (getting killed while minding your own business by a player) ""grinding"" (standing around killing the same things over and over and over again for hours if not days) and a less than supportive or involved community of teens at each other's throats I'd highly recommend that you find a different means of occupying your time.

2.0,True,"03 11, 2012",A2SSBTV5US30QL,B000MI0W3U,James Hunt,"Positives:

  Easy installation.  No going online, etc.

  Graphics and sound effects good.

  Character creation great.  Can customize body (proportions, height), hair, facial features (eyes, nose, chin, mouth, etc.) This was very similar to a Tiger Woods golf game.

  Career mode good - training, coaches, tournaments, etc.

Negatives:

  No option to set difficulty of game.  No adjustment for mouse sensitivity.

  No option to set perspective.  Sometimes you would be behind your character as in any other third person perspective game.  Then other times it would switch and you would be looking at your character from the other side of the court. You could not select one or the other or both.

  After every point you had to watch players' reactions.  That got old very fast.

  Controls were extremely difficult to use.  (I was using keyboard and a corded, optical mouse)  When serving you would click W,A,S, or D to start serve, then watch a power scale and try to click again when it was at maximum.  That part was o.k.  The problem was with returns.  First you would move the mouse to where the ball was hit toward.  Then you would hit W,A,S, or D for your swing type selection, (holding it down for more power and precision), then move the mouse forward, backward, left, right, or diagonally to aim your shot.  Mind you, this is all in the fraction of a second that it takes for the ball to reach your side of the court.  The easiest option was to use the S key for a safe shot.  That shot would always stay in bounds.  Of course you still had to get to the correct location in time which wasn't always easy.  Even if you hit 10-15 safe returns in a row your opponent (even low level players) would 95% of the time match you shot for shot until you got caught out of position and missed.  To have a better chance of scoring you had to use a ""risk"" shot.  For those you would again use the mouse to get into position, then press and hold the spacebar, press W,A,S, or D (which now brought up a meter to watch) and hold till the indicator was in the top position.  (it moves very fast)  Oh, and as mentioned before, once you pressed your shot selection button the mouse now switches from moving the character to aiming your shot.  In all I played about 120 games and was able to win only 2 times!

  The time to uninstall the game was the longest I ever encountered.  It made me wonder what it was doing.

First off the developers need to know that if they are going to make an adventure game in VR the graphics of their engine need to be top notch and the controls for turning around shouldn't motion sick players. If you hope this game to be like robinson the journey don t get your hopes up with loading human. The Graphics are 5/10 not the best but not the worst. The Puzzles are dumb sometimes and i felt the game should have started at the end where things were a lot more interesting than stuck in a base. The Puzzles are just no intuitive for this adventure game. Now for walking it takes forever to go from point A to B. It is so slow that if you dare to forget something in a room you will be annoyed to walk back to that room and try to find it. Also for turning the devs did something counter intuitive. You have two axes X( horizontal) and Y ( vertical) so when you to switch direction you have to point your move controller  lets say to the right to turn right. It doesn't make you do a full scene rotation but it s like it s taking snapshot and from this you can get epilepsies.  You want to make a 180 turn you have to put your move controller facing behind your shoulder and  click the middle button. Also for you to walk which is acceptable you have to press the middle button of theme controller. I tried to use also a dual shock and trust me it is worst than the move controller. It doesn t make anything better

Story
Here is the thing. The story is slow and boring in my opinion. Yea you are in a base where you about to fly to space but you never fly to space and beside the acting is lacking in this game. I will try to be as much spoiler free for everyone who is reading it. You are in a base with only 2 other character ( your father and Alice). You are subject to find a matter in space in order to save your father but before you do so you  need to do some few things. As a player i was excited of going to space but it s when you finish the game that you think and scratching your head and say out loud ""the developer missed something here"" or ""What the .... Just happened"" Yes the game tries to be a big mind game during the story but it didn't use the right formulas. It makes you try to care about the characters but the writing was so cheesy that you believe that an amateur did this. The voice acting is not that bad but hearing this ""Alice my love i ll come back for you..."" in a none emotional robotic way i really think they could have come up with better lines. There is a sex scene in this game (not full on sex as it is cut off but it gets to the idea) so  if you have  a young kid who wants to play  this game i would recommend to the parents to watch the gameplay on youtube and see the sex scene  or to play (if you dare play this game) through before the kid is playing
Also the task through out the story was pretty much like a chore and not fun to do to be honest.

 However, when I bought the X-Box and came home with the game, I found that after many more hours of play, the game can become very, very frustrating. Once inside career mode you can buy a cheap car and upgrade it for a slight performance difference. Once you've won a few races you can buy other cars or maybe you want to play in the Official Races.
 The Official Races were a complete mistery to me and after getting my B Licence, I wish I would have never played them. All the Licence's seem to do is make the difficulty go up as well as the cash for winning a race. However, the rate at which difficulty goes up is not matched by the money. By the time you hit B Licence, you'll find the CPU Car's shooting way ahead of you from the beginning of the race and cornering at speeds you'd never be able to, even though they may have the same car as you with the same spec's. This is a very cheap way of making the game harder. The worst part about it is once you gain licences, your screwed and can't go back to old licences (difficulties) unless you start over.
 One thing that you learn early in this game is that research doesn't help much. After researching the best car to buy out of all the cars available for $27,000-30,000 price range, I found that the Camero was the best buy. Sure enough it ran well in the races, about as well as any of the other cars.
Oh and did you know, Damage is inexistant! No damage modeling in this game what so ever, atleast none that I can see. The only form of ""damage"" is a meter in the top right of the screen that says how much health the car has left before you hit ""max damage"". What max damage means, I have yet to find out, since you can race with max damage on just as well as you can with perfect health. Also physics are pretty nill when it comes to bumping around with other cars. Bumping against another car will make your health go down just as fast as if you plow straight into a wall. Yet the car still appears to be untouched.
In short I was ready to chuck my new X-Box out the window the day after I bought it because of this game.
However, if you are able to look past these problems, you will find beautiful graphics and a fair sound track. The game interface is only mediocre.
Yet I pledge my word that on the [money] I spent on this system, I will attempt to see only the good side of this game, in which case this game is a small piece of heaven, very very small.

Clumsy controls on the PC and very awkward fighting.  What happened to the clean City of Heroes graphics that still look good?  Cryptic said it was to give Champions Online a ""comic-book"" feel.  Well - it just looks like a 1990's FPS game to me.  And they also use the same engine in their new game Star Trek Online???  Someone at Cryptic needs to stand up and say ""our new graphics engine is @#$#"".  A sci-fi game like Star Trek deserves far better graphics and controls.

Nevertheless, there have been some that should've delivered, but missed out on a lot of opportunity. That has shown recently with the release for Rock Band for the Nintendo Wii. The gameplay missed out on a lot of action to compete with the driven success it has shown for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, especially with the ability to download new songs and strum your heart away to many great hits. Instead, Wii owners felt a bit saddened when they found out that there were going to be seperately made track pack expansion discs that will be available for Wii gamers to play to, that would add to the gameplay. Here is what the first one sounds like.

Rock Band Track Pack: Volume 1 for the Nintendo Wii is the first expansion add-on for those who've wanted a bit more for Rock Band. The game features 20 songs that are new for Wii owners to jam to, but the list mainly feels like it is short of being a decent way to rock out loud. While there are some songs that work well to the gameplay like guilty pleasures, Weezer and their classic hit Buddy Holly and the recently reunited Stone Temple Pilots with Interstate Love Song, most of the other tracks don't really seem to shine with the gameplay. While the graphics look great as an addition to Rock Band, it just doesn't shine within the story mode, or enough with the action of the game. The songlist also could've brought in some more of the mainstream hits from the big acts. While it is great to hear Lynard Skynard, I was hoping to jam to Freebird rather than Gimme Three Steps as a example.

All in all, Rock Band Track Pack: Volume 1 is a bit of a dissapointment for Wii owners who've still awaited for more to jam to, that have left them with a destroyed amplifier and brokenhearted dreams of being in a great rock band. I really was hoping that even with all the problems that plagued the game for the Wii, this could've brought those who wanted to Rock Out Loud driven to buy the game for the Wii, but instead it just misses the action and heads for a heartbreak. If Rock band 2 comes to the Wii, it had better be an improvement than this.

If you've ever played games like Splinter Cell or Tenchu, then you know what I'm talking about. The twist in Manhunt is that you  are playing as a villian. You are playing a game of death with a bunch of psychos and killers. Within the game, you'll hear the voice of a sinister director who tells you what your objective is to complete a level. Most of the levels look like abandoned cities. Scattered around are killers who want to hunt you down. So you sneak up on them and the longer you remain undetected the more gruesome  your executions becomes. You'll see the executions in a type of video sequences. The game is terribly violent and bloody it looks a lot like a slasher movie (think Friday the 13th). And this is why the game has a lot of controversy. It is senseless violence and has absolutely no redeeming value!

Pros:

+good graphics

+good sound effects

+good difficulty

+bloody

+creepy atmosphere

+lots of weapons

Cons:

-way too violent/ no morals

-you play a bad guy

-you are under-equipped

-linear gameplay

Not thrilled to say the least. The graphics are sharp on the PS4 and the movement is very fluid but that's about where it ends for me. It seems like this was another extension of MW3 which I stopped playing after about 6 weeks. Again, another Infinity Ward game where I am getting shot by folks I have not even seen yet when I turn a corner. And before anyone even says it, this is with Perks on which prevent me from being highlighted by Sat Coms, Oracles, etc. There was a bad case of lag in MW3 which stopped me from playing it and I'm seeing it again in Ghosts. Lag is going to happen on occasion. I understand that. But it shouldn't be consistent like it is with the Inifinity Ward games. I didn't see these issues with either of the Black Ops games. The only plus Ghosts has over MW3 is that the voice chat is improved. My friends no longer sound like they are talking through tin foil.

I would return this game and exchange it for Battlefield 4 but my daughters bought it for me for Christmas and I don't want to hurt their feelings.

It seems like every other day Sony is announcing a brand new game for the PS4, but this always ends up being an old indie PC game that has been ported over to the PS4. Sony keeps releasing old indie PC ports, games that are 4+ years old, but marketing them as brand new games!

The reason I bought a PS4 was to play the exclusive titles from Sony. I was looking forward to some quirky JRPGs and other foreign content straight out of Japan that I couldn't otherwise get on PC. Unfortunately the PS4 has only a handful of truly exclusive games and it's extremely rare when a new exclusive is announced. The PS Store and in turn my PS+ Instant Games Collection is littered with multiplat indie games and various other garbage that I've already played to death years ago on PC.

So far, the only games Ive been able to enjoy on PS4 are Bloodborne, Killzone, and a few of the PS3 exclusives theyve re-released for PS4 such as The Last of Us, and Uncharted Collection. The 100s of other games theyve brought to the PS4 are either already in my Steam library, or could easily be purchased for a lower price on the Steam store.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean for this to come off as a pro-pc-master-race review or anything. Just try to understand where Im coming from.
In my situation, I have a capable PC, I have a library of Steam games that Ive been accumulating over 10+ years. I'm looking for exclusives that I could not play on my PC.

In my case I truly feel that I would have been better off buying a Wii U or 3DS because of Nintendos heavy focus on first party exclusive games and its extensive library of highly rated games. I ultimately regret my decision to buy the PS4.

Maybe your situation is similar, maybe you should get a Nintendo console too.
Of course maybe you don't have a PC, and maybe you've never heard of any of the titles Sony is releasing on PS4. If that is the case, then you could probably benefit from a PS4 and your purchase would be justified. The PS4 is definitely the best PC gaming alternative on the market. If you're unable to buy or maintain a PC then there is no doubt that PS4 is the way to go.

On a side note, the PS TV / PS Vita are a great buy if you're a PC gamer. It has so many incredible exclusive games that you won't be able to play anywhere else.

So you HAVE to have friends over in order to play the other 4. That's pretty terrible, especially since you need an internet connection to play the game, you should be able to play online with people who aren't at your place. Terrible.

The only way this game would be good is if you had multiple friends over.

Hopefully they will do something about all those issues. And to be sincere I have plenty more but I don't want to bore anyone with my nonsense.

Update 11/9/15: The sound bug that has plagued COD from Treyarch since BO1 is still present. If you are having issues joining Zombie public lobbies try doing some solo games first. Apparently until you do solo with any of the four characters, that specific character won't be able to be part of a public match. Makes a lot of sense right... The lag is subsiding but still quite noticeable. According to YouTubers that usually do tests for such games the engine itself has a 4 give it or take one frame lag. And thats before you add in internet lag. So yeah some games you will be ahead of most others and do really good and other matches you will be running around getting one shot in your perspective.

Cons:
I'll only talk about 1 problem so this isn't a book of a review. A lot of the other problems in the game follow this same formula. During Legacy play, you practice things such as shooting, rebounding, post defense, etc to develope your players. This should have been fun, but 2K dropped the ball here. I have now tried the 3-point shot drill many times (maybe 40) and still haven't passed it once. That might be besides the fact, but there are good reasons it is so difficult and it isn't my skills. The camera pans in everytime you shoot so you cant see your player anymore. The player will also move (sometimes a lot) after they shoot and you will have to wait for the camera to pan back, wait for the rebounder to get you the ball back (takes 2-3 seconds, which is an eternity), set yourself- making sure you are in the circle they want you to shoot from, then you can shoot and hope you remain in the circle during your shot. This is a problem, folks. In shooting drills it is very important to 'flow' and how did 2K expect us to flow when there is so damn much going on at once before, during, and after each shot?? It kills the fun and makes the game more of a hassle than entertainment. The menus are frustrating as well. For instance, they make you hit ""OK"" sometimes when ""OK"" is the only option. ""EXIT"" is another one they like to make you take time to press. I hope you follow what I mean here. If you only have 1 option, why do they make you think about it? haha. Geez.

Pros:
The actual gameplay during games is great. Fun. The graphix aren't anything new, but good. There are plenty of teams and conferences to choose from so chances are your favorite team is in the game (go Xavier). Some of the other drills are fun, even if there are those few that will have you more angry than anything.

Bottomline, this game is great if you only focus on actually playing the actual games, but there is totally too much frustration going on that its hard to WANT to turn the game on in the first place. I would recommend trying EA's college basketball game first. I personally haven't played it yet, but this game by 2K isn't what you're probably looking for.

2.0,False,"10 29, 2008",AK246V9TNUHT4,B000ZKA0KA,dansw4,"Well I was one of those fans of the series who has been playing since the release of Socom 1. Like most people I felt the series fell off after Socom 2. Most people who enjoyed Socom 3 and CA were new comers who didn't know the difference and so they accepted the later games while the original fans left the series and the community crumbled.

Socom Confrontation was supposed to be the return to greatness the original fans hoped for. We had all been dreaming of a next gen Socom to wipe out all the issues we had had on the PS 2 such as cheating and lag.
The developers promised to return to the roots and restore the core gameplay of the earlier games in the series. They failed on so many levels. To make matters worse while saving some not so important core elements they changed the most important core elements that were directly related to giving this game the Socom feel or atmosphere.

You're going to see alot of fanboys who love everything with Socom slapped on the cover drooling all over this game and encouraging you to purchase it which is very ill advised as most people aren't as easily impressed by just the Socom name alone.

First issue is well documented,the server errors,logging on is a problem,consoles locking up is a problem,freezing while in the middle of a game is a problem,the problems at launch are far worse then the average launch title. Fanboys say ""oh but wait for the patches that can be fixed"".Ok so i will tell you know about the gameplay elements themselves that can't be fixed as I am 100% sure Slant 6 won't make patches for anything other then game errors.

First off this game was built around OTS (over the shoulder view) and while it has a classic view the contols for classic view are seriously compromised because of the existance of OTS as the default. Plus classic view is not quite the same third person view we used to have,its zoomed in closer to your back (shows about waist up and doesn't show the whole body even in wide open parts of the map unless you look down at your feet.

You now need to use motion controls to lean instead of the easy d-pad lean that was much more responsive. Motion controls are a gimmick to label it ""next gen"" and are never as precise as the simple push of a button. The reason d-pad controls are gone for classic view is that in night vision you are forced into OTS view and need d-pad controls to use for the OTS perspective,so yes they didn't exactly tell the truth when they said we would have a true classic view cause its a different third person perspective and OTS is still forced on you anytime you go into night vision.

Gone also is first person perspective that you could use to see through windows and bushes. After having that view for urban warfare in past games you will see how sorely missed it is when you have the hampered view trying to shoot people from windows. Also you can't move the camera up that way to see out a bush so you pretty much have to crawl out of the bush and expose alot of your body to see,so much for hiding like a seal.

The control set up is far less intuitive then it was before. The simple quick swap is gone and you must now stop playing and select your new weapon through a weapon wheel menu that hampers the fluidity of gameplay.throwing grenades can be done with a button but to get the furthest range you need to use motion controls and even then your max range is half what it used to be. On top of that the kill radius on grenades is non existant. Its literally like throwing firecrackers at the opponents. For every 4 grenades that land and explode right in the enemies lap you are lucky to get one kill. Most times grenades that blow up right at your feel take away no health at all. Gone is the old knockdown radius that would knock an opponent down and injure him if he was just out of the killzone but in shrapnel range. You either die or you don't no inbetween. The grenade system feels like it is more primitive then even the first Socom on the PS 2 which was made about 8 years ago. Nothing next gen about the grenades here it took steps backwards to the 16 bit era of video games.

The lobby system is watered down from past games. The friends list is very generic no longer showing the room your friend is in or allowing you to join off the friends list.

There are people already glitching so gone is the theory that PS 3 would bring a cheat free experience. Only time will tell if it can be fixed if they make good on promises to start banning people which will probably be on hold while they concentrate on the bugs first.

No person in their right mind can say this is the best Socom yet. If success of this game rides on graphics alone then i can see some people praising this game as the graphics are a definite upgrade from the old Socoms. As far as all the other elements such as controls,gameplay,and the community/lobby features this game is a massive downgrade in every way. New people to the series and graphics fanatics seem to be the only ones claiming this is the best Socom ever. True Socom fans would never embarass themselves by making such a claim. I will say that when you can get into a game its better then Socom 3 and CA but Socom 1 and 2 overall are still by far the best games in this series.

After seeing the finished product I wish they had just kept Zipper making the game and fired Seth Luisi as he is the real problem thats hurting the series. A remake of the old Socom 2 with better hit detection and graphics woudl have been a huge improvement over this game. Many will tell you ""oh well it needed to evolve and change"".I can understand that if the changes were taking the game forward but when a next gen system takes the game backwards in gameplay,controls,and lobby system I hardly see where that is evolving. I think people still praising this game are in severe denial and want to love this game cause its better then to accept that Socom has died. After the newness of the graphics and maps wears off i think they will realize the only real improvements were graphics and sound while everything else is a downgrade compared to Socoms 1 and 2. These are only some of the issues i could go on and on and right a whole book of stupid additions and omissions from this new Socom. Its so lacking that I am literally jaw dropping shocked at how some people claiming to be with the series since day 1 call this the best Socom yet. They had to have forgotten everything that made the old Socoms great or are simply to blinded by new pretty graphics to stop and notice everything thats been screwed up severely.

Save your money and get RFOM 2 when it comes out. The first Resistance Fall of Man had a better server on their very first attempt and Sony has gone cheap lackluster servers for 5 straight Socoms now. I played the first RFOM to tide me over till Socom but after playing it RFOM is easily the better online game. Until we get a next gen Socom that truly goes back to its roots RFOM is the new king of online play for the PS 3 and the improvements I have already seen in the sequel coming next month just cement its spot all the more. If you are willing to sacrafice some realism for a fun game with a much smoother server to play with people all over the world the RFOM series is best all around. It took me awhile to adjust to RFOM as I loved Socom and the real military aspects but the gameplay has just fallen so far off its not the same Socom the original players knew and loved.",Don't believe fanboy hype,1225238400,4,{'Edition:': ' Bundle with Bluetooth Headset'},
2.0,False,"02 13, 2016",A1FCIAE7P5EB7Q,B00T3MEQNI,AmznAddict,"It's a welcome addition in terms of content when you think about what little content the base game came with. This is what you get:

- Three new active careers (doctor, scientist, detective) as well as career location (a hospital, a lab, a police station)
- A hidden alien world
- Aliens
- Photography and baking skills
- Ability to open retail store
- Sims can choose to have their babies delivered in a hospital

The active careers are a novel idea, as we've never been able to follow our sims to work. If you like achievement oriented gameplay, you will probably love this. It does get quite boring if you want a little bit more freedom. The game gives you linear tasks to do like mop up the floor, run some tests, etc. It gets repetitive very fast, but you don't have to choose to go to work with your sims all the time. It does help if you do, because they will get promoted faster. It was quite disappointing the way the implemented the work day as an event so you can only follow one sim to work at a time. If you have two sims working at the same place, they may never run into each other at work. You can't just switch scenes and go back home to see what's going on at home either, it's not like TS3 where everything was open world. I actually enjoyed the active careers, but was disappointed that you could not visit their work place when your sims are not at work. For example, you couldn't take your sick sims to the hospital if you wanted to have them get checked by a doctor. The only way this can happen is when a pregnant sim chooses to have his/her baby in the hospital- this is pretty messed up; they go in a machine and the doctor fishes out their baby with The Claw from Toy Story right from their belly. The detective career is fun, but not so much if you have a slow computer. You have to travel a lot so there will be A TON of loading screens.

My least favorite things about this pack are the lack of a new world and the retail system. For a long time after the base game came out, people were complaining about how small the worlds were and how we needed more space. This game did not address that. Instead a free patch accompanied this pack to include 5 more lots, which really is nothing. Remember in The Sims 1,2,3 when new worlds popped up all the time with new expansion packs?

The retail system is truly a disappointment if you are an Open For Business diehard fan like me. There are no cash registers, customers don't form lines, there are no more cute display cases to make a store feel like a store. You get empty shelves to fill with individual items, and a tablet through which all transaction takes place. No more cute cash register animations as the cash register is pretty much only for show. No more cute floral stands, clothing stands and electronic stands to make the store seem more lively and legitimate. Although the mannequins are cool, you can only have so many at a store before you hit the limit (10 max). You can display the clothing stand from the base game which is really just a decorative item, as opposed to the clothing racks you used to be able to browse through in TS2. There are no dressing rooms to woohoo in either :( You can't have shophouses, because you can't live where you work. The photo studio seems so cool, but you can't really take pictures for money. You do it for free and then try to sell the photos you take to random sims....what it really ends up being is more like an art gallery. There are no cute little details like shoppers carrying their shopping bags, or sims messing up on the cash register when they are first learning how to operate it. It is nice that now when you run your store, you'll get quite a lot of sims, but more often than not its the same 10 sims that show up every day.

The baking skill is nice, it's a separate skill than the cooking or gourmet cooking skill. You can bake on the stove or on the donut machine. However, if you think it will be fun running a bakery by combining the retail aspect and the baking skill just like in the trailers- think again. You have to sell each individual item, and sims who buy your cupcakes don't really eat there. It's just like buying a piece of art or furniture, it's no different than any other retail store. They won't eat there, they can't buy coffee there (you need the Get Together EP for that). Even with the coffee machine from Get Together, you can't really sell coffee in your retail store unless you are either selling the actual coffee machine or brewing individual cups, displaying it, and trying to sell those (like you would with a piece of art or furniture, excepts its a brewed cup of coffee).

What they also forget to add in this pack are new aspirations and new traits. You would think this would be the perfect opportunity to add new aspirations (best inventor, best doctor, best detective, best baker, best photographer...... ) and traits (brave, hates aliens, loves aliens....). The opportunity for adding new personalities in the form of aspirations and traits was so perfect here, and they didn't even add a single one. We got aliens, which can annoying fast if you are a realistic player. They do disguise themselves to look like sims, but once you travel to the alien world and see who all the aliens really are, they will forever look like an alien to you and you will realize how many random aliens there are and will soon start to get annoyed that aliens are in your retail store. There needs to be a button to disable aliens, just like how you could disable supernaturals in The Sims 3.

James,"Once again I have been duped into buying a game based upon the advice of so-called consumer reviews only to discover that the game fails to live up to the hyperbole. Lets be brutally honest, Praetorians is a game which is marketed to appeal to the Medieval Total war fans but delivers a product more akin to Age of Empires. If you are about seven years old and/or have a basically juvenile sense of wonder then surely this game was tailor made for you. With the exception of the even more awful Platoon PC game this has to rate as my biggest gaming disappointment to date. The pundits for this mediocre yawner glory over the fact that the game has no resource management thus freeing you up to do lots of scrapping. This is basically true but on the down side the maps are so badly designed that manouvering units in anything other than a gaggle is practically impossible. Units will often blunder into one another and become entangled, this is not conducive to a happy gaming experience and the battle has not even been joined yet. But this is pretty much the essence of the game. It (bottlenecked maps)force you into waging war between individual units rather than the grand battles of the ancient kingdoms which were set piece affairs on open ground. Units are created in villages/towns which sounds fine but once again we are dealing with an abstract depiction - a few huts and structures surrounded by a simplified pallisade and peopled by a few sprites which bustle about to simulate an occupation of sorts. Oh did I mention that this village/town is just slightly larger than a unit of infantry? Must have slipped every reviewer's mind I guess. Even creating units is a puzzlement. Just create a barracks and then instruct your leaders to train this or that and voila there they are-a couple of minutes later. Although some units require that your leader sacrifice honour points to create-Oh did I forget to mention that, must have slipped my mind....Honour is won in the slaying of enemies. In short there is an artificiality pervading the game which rather than enhancing gameplay reduces it to a farce. The Ai prefers to operate with a mob mentality - so much easier than trying to reproduce the model of efficiency and co-ordination which was the Roman Legionary system. Unlike the Total War series which relies upon maps with realistic terrain, Praetorians has opted for an even more simplified version of Age of Empires (the original one at that). Even the camera view is severely limiting because you can only see in line of sight which is not very far in this abstract representation of the real world. The map is revealed - not blacked out- thank heaven for small mercies. Pulling the camera back to take in anything more than a top down view of a small area is impossible-pretty much like playing the game. This even extends to the lack of ability to angle the camera - something I haven't seen in a game like this since I don't know when. PC gamers deserve so much more than a retro update on a much worn out formula given the relative expense of a new purchase - $40 or more for most, including this one. In mere value for the dollar I would be hard pressed to say that at half the price I paid for it ($20) that it is a worthwhile purchase.

Devil May Cry 3 and DMC 3: Special Edition follow the same general formula as the original game. Plenty of combat laden areas and cool looking weapons, a hero and an antagonist seeking power. The storyline of the series has never been the main focus and that is apparent in this game. Characters are brought in almost at random and with cloudy reasoning for their motivations.

What has always set the DMC games apart from the rest is the action packed sequences and boss battles. While DMC 3 has plenty of both you'll end up lamenting purchasing the game due to it's definitively tired controls, abysmal voice acting, broken camera system and poor storyline.

In deciding to make DMC 3 a prequel to DMC, Capcom presents a much younger version of Dante. In an effort to project the younger version Capcom also made him somewhat immature. While you may argue that this decision is appropriate you'll quickly realize in playing the game that Dante resembles a hyperactive adolescent boy. The sequences in between combat are laughable as any time Dante opens his mouth it's an embarrassment to the talented folks at Capcom.

I was so excited for this controller only to be let down... twice. Yep, I've gone through two units, I'm done. The first unit was bought from here on Amazon, the second one was shipped from Razer. It comes in nice shiny packaging, smells great. Lol, I love the smell of new electronics. Anyway, to the pros and cons and overall.

PROS:
-A,B,X,Y buttons are smaller, but as they say ""hyper-responsive"" they're very good unlike the bulky standard 360 controller which by the way I have one (standard 360 controller) that the B button snags on the plastic side as I mash. One of my many 360 controllers in my possession.
-D pad is nice. It has separate buttons like keyboard keys but more solid. They're nice
-Lights up. The A,B,X,Y buttons light up, as well as the M$ guide button and the D pad has arrows on it that light up.
-Programmable buttons are awesome. ""Remapping"" buttons like the select button for Bad Company 2 so you can spot enemies easier.
-Adjustable tension thumbsticks. This is quite awesome. You can make the thumbsticks super tight for people that like it like that, or super loose (like me :P)
-Textured rubberized grip. The controller is overall coated with rubberized material. Its not so rubbery that you can stick you fingernail in it, its just coated.

CONS (This comes from my personal experience with this controller.):

(Controller 1)
-I'll start with big and go to small things. The main issue for me with this controller  is after using it, what, 3 weeks, the thumbsticks became loose. Not as described with the tension adjustable knobs, this it due to clicking the thumbsticks for use in games such as call of duty: sprinting or zooming in with sniper rifle, clicking to hold breath to steady shots, etc. In a matter of 3 weeks I can shake the controller, the thumbsticks are so loose, it will move my character. Not acceptable, especially being one of the biggest gamers on Earth, imo XD.
-More on the thumbsticks. Yes, the adjustable tension is a nice touch, but click the thumbsticks as I said not only led to them becoming loose as I tried to describe to you, they are just overall extremely hard to push. This might have led to the fact that they became loose for me. Razer suggested I use the programmable buttons to replace the thumbstick clicking. I mean, should I really have to do that?  I did this, meh.
-The trigger buttons. Eh, you could call it a positive or a negative. They are more like fish hooks instead of a flat place for your fingers. I think its quite annoying, but if you continue to use it, you will get used to it.

(Controller 2)
-Well, I finally get a new controller from Razer. Thank you Razer for your help, but I wound up with yet another faulty controller. Only issue that has happened with this one is glitching. The controller seems like its short wiring or something because I simply push forward, not even clicking in the sticks, and it glitches. Its like non-responsive. Not sure how else to describe it. After many times of this happening to confirm, I've sense unplugged it and thrown it in the pile with the rest of my non-functioning electronics.

OVERALL:
If you want to gamble $50 on a new controller, go ahead. You might have better luck than me. Yes, apart from everything I have described, which I'm fairly certain I've covered everything, it is a solid controller. Seeing as all the garbage I just described is actual for me, it is therefore not a solid, in other words, reliable controller.
  As for me, I will not be buying from Razer again seeing as the first product I got from them was a Razer Habu gaming mouse. So loved this thing but it was glitchy as well.

This game is just terrible, an insult to the legacy of Yoshi's Island.  It is best summarized by probably its biggest issue: this game uses both screens of the DS for gameplay, but the space BETWEEN the screens is also used, meaning that there is a blind spot in the VERY CENTER of the gameplay.  It is nothing but frustration when you keep getting hit by enemies that come out of nowhere from that blind spot, and especially when you play the levels with moving platforms you find yourself being force to play with your character in that blind spot.

First off, I want to say that the studio who ported it did a pretty good job overall. The graphics aren't as clean as they were on my IBM 386 back in the day, but I can forgive that kind of thing because the game feels the same. You move at the same rate, shooting feels the same, the only thing missing as far as gameplay goes is a keyboard.

The levels are faithfully reproduced- every secret door is where I remember it was, which is always kind of fun for those looking back with nostalgia. It contains all 6 original episodes (although you'd think that, barring some sort of legal entanglement they could have included its sequel Spear of Destiny).

There are two central problems with this port which are the main reasons I can't rate it higher. First, you can't save your game wherever you'd like (which you could do in the original). You can only save at the beginning and end of levels. Nothing sucks more than to make it almost to the elevator when an SS guy comes out of nowhere and guns your last 10% of health away. My other problem is the game's lack of music. Hey, what gives? The original had some classic MIDI tuneage courtesy of Bobby Prince, who also scored the Commander Keen games, DOOM, and Duke Nukem 3D. It's just not the same. Ever tried watching Star Wars wthout the music? It's like there's a key element missing.

For some reason, I got the impression this was a shooter.
NOPE
I'll do the GOOD/BAD review.
Installing:
Uuugh. If you have Vista, prepare for one blocked attempt after another. It took MANY tries to find the patch to download and finally restart my computer and finally play.
Opening:
Good: not much
Bad: The building of a character was very minimal. Not a whole lot of room for changing your character. I guess I got too used to Oblivion.
Tutorials:
Good: Not much
Bad: As you are dropped into your first screen, the tutorials last about 3 seconds and fade away before you can realize what you just read.
Game play:
Good: At first I thought, nice, one hit zombies that get harder to kill and enemies changed somewhat quickly with each task you are sent on.
Bad: The same monsters are all identical. One zombie looks exactly like another. YOUR character movements are very stiff. No, you can not free roam around. In order to go to a new zone, you have to accept a task to go there. Right and Left mouse click seemed to do almost the same attack. Nothing special there too.
Overall:
If you love games like Titan Quest and Dungeon Seige, have fun. It's like they tried to mix them with Oblivion.
It just looks like they upped the graphics from those games and dropped this on us. I saw nothing really NEW here. The graphics aren't bad. Just not all that impressive. Voice acting was nothing to frown on but not really ""acting"" either.

2.0,False,"12 25, 2011",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000BNKSVC,Brent Butler,"Like many, I looked forward to this game for a long time. Unfortunately the game makes itself very hard to like, just through some unfortunate choices made by the developers.

First, and very unfortunately, this game is keyed to having the CD in your drive before it will launch. I thought this moronic style of copy protection was gone many years before this game came out, but evidently not. Especially when you must enter a LONG serial number when installing the game in the first place, you should not have to keep track of and insert CDs for the game to play.

Next, I found the interface to be unnecessarily convoluted, and not intuitive at all. Just the organization of the areas didn't make a lot of sense to me, with some of the buttons you need to use the most being small in size and squeezed inconveniently down into the lower left corner of the screen. Some buttons to interface with the game have tool-tips, others do not. Some seem to have tool-tips only part of the time. LOL

In the play of the game itself, there is indeed a lot of variety, eventually, in the types and functions of units. For example, you can build smugglers for assignment to planets to leech wealth. However, you sort of just have to know you can do that, because the interface for using the smuggler doesn't show up until after you have built one, selected him, and selected a target world.

As others have mentioned, the game is supposed to be suitable for grand strategic play, but it completely fails there. I've played enough small unit real time sims, so I bought this game after reading promo material concerning the ""galactic map"" strategic play. The automatic combat resolution algorithms are badly broken, meaning that if you want to make real progress, you still have to RTS all the battles. Also, a grand strategic play style cries out for turn based moves. If you happen to look up from this game for a few minutes of real world distraction ... days of game time pass.

Finally, I found the game to be, visually, very poorly presented. Even the very simple graphics presented on the galactic map appeared dull and clunky. Increasing the screen resolution in video options surprisingly didn't improve the visual presentation of the game one bit. It was also difficult to do, as unfortunately the dialog to change the screen resolution, on my system, caused the mouse to disappear until I minimized the game and then clicked to bring it back up!",Big Disappointment,1324771200,,,

The issue is that there's no way to mount a battery pack on a DS4 -- it's a smooth, curvy body build without a removable battery pack. So the best solution Energizer could engineer is to mount a battery pack that attaches ONLY though the microUSB charging port. The hope is that it will fit snug in the port / hug the body of the controller. Which is great .... for about the first hour of use. inevitably, things bend and loosen and otherwise aren't perfect, especially on older controllers. One of my two was fitting loose to begin with, and it's only gotten worse as the controller has been used.

From aiming, to switching between weapons, reloading, crouching/lying down/taking cover/goggles/battlefield map, etc., etc., this game probably has the most complicated control system of any shooter. Then you have to gain competence deploying all the various resources the game gives you--at the same time, while taking fire from enemies.  At many points you command your squad which is walking with you, plus a ground vehicle, plus a helicopter, plus an ""eye in the sky"" reconnaisance drone!  The wheeled vehicle, helicopter and drone have no AI, so they don't do anything unless you command, btw!  Not to mention controlling your actual character at the same time.

The other problem is the fact that the character just moves really slowly.  He aims slowly, he reloads slowly, he does everything way slowly, and that gets you killed but quick.  The aiming is just painfully. freaking. slow.  Dudes will blow you away while you try haul your gun around.  I'd say the character moves his gun at about 1/2 the speed a person in real life would.  When you have the scope up on the rifles, that speed gets cut to about 1/6 the speed it would be in real life.  Ridiculously frustrating.

Then there's the fact that you can be blown away with just a couple of shots from enemies whose targeting is impeccable, and who are camouflaged really well.  Add to that the fact that it is about 1 million miles and a thousand bad guys between save points, and that any type of healing is even more rare than the save points are!

I own an HD-DVD player and after comparing the movies and the players HD-DVD ""blu"" the Sony out of the water.  I compared Superman Returns in both format and the HD-DVD version at 1080p is much clearier, less graining, and more crisp then the Blu Ray version.  The ps3 takes forever to load the movies and the system is terribly loud while playing games and watching movies.  I had to turn the volume up in order to not hear the system running.

Next, is the internet service available.  Yes, many would say this sounds cool but I actually couldn't stand it!!!  The interface is absolutely terrible and searching was difficult.  I actually got so frustrated that after the first day of owning this machine I never attempted to get on the internet via the PS3 again.

Online gaming isn't terrible but it isn't great either.  I have Verizon FIOS so speed is not an issue with me, but connections with the server were constantly happening.  PS3 online seemed disorganized and jus tnot as funa nd user friendly as Xbox Live.

The controller is notrious!!! I can't believe Sony is still using this 11 year old piece of junk.  It feels light and flemsy and I was just begging for an Xbox 360 controller.

All the other games have no problems showing the ""hand cursor"" so you know where your are in relationship to the buttons to press.  This game seems to have them about half the time.  The other half, there's a button, and moving your arm around with no guidance on the screen, it's a hit and miss trying to orient exactly where the system thinks your hand is so you can guess which way to move it to hit the button.

Happens every time we play.

Game controls are more of a pain than anything else as well, and this is by far the least responsive Kinect game of all the ones I've got so far.

Doing the skiing is pretty impossible, as it just can't seem to correctly see my movements nor my sons.  So frustration ensues and the game gets put away in favor of the ones that play well.

2.0,False,"12 6, 2006",A2615K4AJSX078,B000E0XX9Q,H.Le,"Overall, this is an excellent game that is still in the beta stage. Therefore, 1) please do not buy this game unless your gaming computer meets the recommended requirements -- not the minimum requirements - that is almost certainly not good enough.  2) even if you can run the game smoothly, be ready for bugs.  3) be sure to download all the patches: either 1.02 or 1.03 beta (they're huge)  4) Go to the NWN2 community web site and see what kind of problems are out there (there are tons of problems - some of which you surely will encounter) I won't go over them because there are simply too many to list and they happen too randomly.  That is, the few reviewers who criticized the ""whiners"" did not experience them.  On the other hand, there are a lot of non-whiners who have absolutely legitimate reasons to complain over a game that is being released at least 6 months too early. I hope to be fair to both group.

With that said, please let me repeat that this is still an excellent game that has major issues.  Graphic is good but NOT spectacular considering the game being a resource hog.  Oblivion, albeit being a different type of gameplay, truly has spectacular graphic for the same system requirement.  However, we all know that games should not be based on eye candies alone but on how fun it is to play, and that is NWN 2's saving grace. Gameplay is a big improvement over NWN1.  You now have almost full control of up to 5 party members - very similar to Star Wars Knight of the Republic 2 (from the same maker, Obsidian) with a touch of Baldur's Gate gameplay thrown in, but do not expect the same level of high precision of control over party members as in Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But that also means that you don't have to micro-manage too much, so it's a give and take situation.  It does take a while, maybe even a great while, or maybe never, but if you can get over the camera annoyances and come to term with it, the game play can really rock as this is really a fun game.

The story is excellent, though not as compelling as NWN 1.  Once you get into it, it will hook you and won't let go.  This is simply what Obsidian does best in this game (and probably all their games).  There is noticeable lack of a central character that you can immediately identify as both the antagonist and a protagonist, and develope a love/hate relationship with, such as Kreia in SWKOTOR 2 or Aribeth in NWN 1.  Regardless, it still is great story telling.

Sound is also excellent but also has lot of minor setback.  To begin with, there are very good theme and backgrougd sound and music, as well as good voice acting.  The complain here is that way too much are borrowed from NWN 1.  If you ever play SWKOTOR 2, you will probably agree that the Obsidian team has plenty of musical talents that does not require borrowed-music.  Perhaps the problem here, as well, is the fact that the game is being released way too early.

As is, my biggest complaint is directed at the corporate suits, AKA the new Arch-Angels of the new God: Profit, that pushes this game to release before X-mas, all for the sake of being able to make the timely offering to their newfound God. My next complaint goes to Obsidian, an extremely talented team (I've played all their games - I've been a gamer since the late 80's) that has the leverage to play hard ball, but instead, chose to bow down or (or bend over) to the Arch-Angels and take it with a smile.

Lastly, I should also complain about us, the gaming community that, apparently, are beginning to think that it is OK to produce unfinished games. Please take some times to think about this.  If you have a real job, you would agree that there is no chance in hell that you can release an incomplete product that did not make it through quality control -- and worst of all, think that it is OK to do so. If you want to be more precise, then here's one: a game should easily run with the stated minimum requirement printed on the box (recommended requirements are purely for eye candies). Do your own research and you will find that is not the case with NWN2.  With that said, I will make myself a reminder to look for Atari's contact email so I can ""whine"" at the right place.

In conclusion, this is an excellent game if you have the recommended gaming rig (remember: recommended - not minimum), and have the patient to deal with the bugs. Your best bet, however, is to wait a 2-3 more months for more patches to come out, and probably at cheaper price, to make it really worth it.

2.0,False,"08 29, 2012",A14ZS48R78ZK2J,B007BGUGVO,SuperGamecube64,"Mario is truly a poly-talented man. He's done it all. Saving princesses, winning the 150cc Star Cup and snagging a few holes in one are all in some of the earliest pages of his resume. On the Nintendo 64, Nintendo decided to let Mario try his hand at tennis (though the series arguably dates back to the NES title ""Tennis""). The result? People loved it! And so they released a Gamecube sequel that added in offensive and defensive power shots as well as gimmick arenas, which was also quite successful. Did Nintendo succeed in bringing this success to the 3DS?

My first impressions of the game on launch day were that the game seemed sloppily thrown together - and that impression still resonates with me. The character select screen in particualr seems very lazy. Instead of the usual board of characters, we get a scroll through list, and the characters even seen out of order.

The controls are simple, and work fine. You move your character with the slide pad, and control shots with the buttons. You still have the same options you always have plus one need shot type. In addition to the ever present lob (A), slice (B), and the various options that come through their combination, you have smash shots (Y). Smash shots are fast, and straight. This game gets rid of the power shots introduced in Mario Power Tennis, and instead uses a system referred to a ""Chance Shots"". At random times, or if certain requirements are met, a small circle on the field will glow a particular color. The colors are coded along side the shot types, and using the correct shot type while in the circle will use the chance shot. For example, if there is a blue chance shot, and you slice the ball (B), the result is a super charged shot that curves outside the field and back into it. Alternatively, if it glows white, you can drop shot(B>A) for a super short drop shot. There is a chance shot for every type of hit in the game, and the most annoying has to be the purple ones. If a player uses the new smash shot while in a purple chance area, you're in for it. The player will spike a super fast fast ball straight down onto your court, and those with slow reflexes won't stand a chance.

Chance shots may sound interesting, but they can quickly become annoying when playing against high level CPUs. It seems that in the higher difficulty tournaments, the computer will always get several chance shots in a row while you just play defense for a couple of minutes. You can call me childish or imamture, ro say that I jsut suck at the game all you want, but there's no getting around the facts - that is an annoying, cheap, and lazy way to make the game harder.

In a never ending attempt to make their games more accessible, Nintendo has thrown in a couple of options for young and newer gamers. Rather than sue the buttons to select your shot type, you can simply tap the touch screen button with the color and name of the shot on it. They also added an option called simple shot, which can be activated via touch screen or by pressing (X). Simple shot will automatically use the most appropriate shot type for your current situation. The shot will be weaker than normal, but I still feel this is a bad idea and will prevent new players from taking to time to learn the real ins and outs of the game.

As always, Nintendo has included some challenging minigames to occupy your time as well as unlock characters, as well as earn coins which you can sue to buy gear - we'll talk more about that in a moment. The minigames are, for the most part, quite challenging. They are very entertaining if you have nothing else to do, but once you've beaten all the difficulties and unlocked all the characters, you'll only be coming back to farm coins. My favorite minigame was Super Mario Bros Tennis, game in which the camera scrolls through a level of Super Mario Bros. world as you collect coins and kill enemies with the tennis ball.

Another feature Nintendo has been including as of late is the ability to play as your Mii. Normally, I groan at this standard, as Mii's generally just annoy me and take away from the game's atmosphere. For the first time, I'm actually glad they included Miis ad playable characters - it is actually well executed. You can spend coins to buy clothing and rackets for your Mii, altering their stats into whatever suits you best (or whatever you think looks cool). You can even dress your Miis up in character costumes such as Bowser and Yoshi.

Possibly the coolest new feature is the use of AR codes. Nintendo has been releasing Ar codes via Nintendo Power Magazine, their official Facebook page, and Club Nintendo which allow you to unlock characters in the game. While this certainly has potential,so far it has been wasted on nothing but some character outfits and some different colored Yoshis. Perhaps they will better utilize this feature in the future.

This is the first Mario Tennis game to be playable online...er..that is that is able to be connected to Nintendo's Wi-Fi network. To say it is playable online would be an exaggeration. Lag and dropped connections are the norm no matter where I connect, be it at home, college, or even McDonalds, the online is simply unbearable.

The graphics are honestly not that great, but there are worse looking games. Everything is fairly smooth and well animated, and as is to be expected of a Mario game the bright, pastel colors stand out nicely. The 3D effect made me a little dizzy, so I just turned it off. If you hold the 3DS vertical, the camera angle will switch to right behind your character, and the character will move a small amount on their own. I found this feature to be utterly useless, and the camera angle screwed me over more than it helped me. If you play this game lying down, the gyro censor will sometimes think you are holding the system vertical, and switch to this camera angle. The best option is to turn the feature off completely in the settings.

Mario Tennis Open had a lot going for it as far as ideas are concerned, but the execution of these ideas is less than stellar. You'll have a much better time if you just buy Mario Power Tennis or even the original for the N64. If you are still adamant about getting this game, I recommend buying used and trying to find the best deal you can- it isn't entirely unworthy of your time, but it isn't worth the full $40, especially with all the other much better 3DS titles you could buy for that same price.",A huge letdown,1346198400,9,,

I just have to accept that and review that game I actually played instead the potential awesomeness I could've played. In opposition to the PC version, the XBOX version has some hastily tacked-on plot (something about having to save your family from an evil baron.) Like I'm sure everybody else did, I choose to ignore all that in lieu of terrorizing the French.

You may remember that Sid Meier is responsible for the insanely addicting Civilization III. Pirates! is a bit of a change of pace in terms of scope - instead of overseeing the fate of an entire civilization for several thousand years, you're limited to taking charge of a single pirate crew in the Caribbean from the mid- to late-1600s. (Since most pirates never got past the wizened age of 45, this makes sense.) After naming your captain and choosing a proficiency (most would choose to improve their dueling prowess, but I choose Wit and Charm for more effective wooing) you're given control of a small ship.

Sailing around and just randomly attacking passing boats can be highly amusing, if not totally broken. Case in point: I was in my insignificant sloop when I saw the Queen Anne's Revenge sail right on by. Channeling my inner Johnny Depp, I decided to go in for the kill. Out-gunned and severely outmanned, I knew the first volley of 15 cannonballs (in opposition to my three) would knock me right out of the water. Instead, I found myself to be... unharmed. I then did what any completely insane pirate would do--bashed my pathetic heap of timber against the legendary ship.

Onboard was the fearsome Blackbeard, flaming beard and all. After a suprisingly easy game of Simon Says that required all of three button presses, I had slain the most fearsome pirate on the high seas and taken his ship. If that isn't evidence of a game in need of balancing, I'd like to know what is!

(Speaking of Blackbeard, my dad is writing a miniseries all about him. Check it out.)

That's basically an apt description for the entire experience: an abundance of strung together mini-games. You've got the ""dancing to win the affections of the governor's daughter"" game, which I prefer to think of as ""virtual finger torture."" Other examples include the ""laying siege to a city"" pseudo-RTS and the ""sneaking into a hostile area"" stealth portion. Needless to say, playing gets to be repetitive in a big hurry.

BOTTOM LINE: I'm not saying you won't be highly amused for a couple of hours. Quite the contrary. Once the novelty wears off, though... I'm afraid you might come to the same horrified realization that I did. You're just playing the illegitimate child of a Mario Party game.",Sid Meier's Pirates,1128297600,24,,

There are notable exceptions of course (BALDUR's GATE II and MAX PAYNE II spring to mind). However, NEVER had I been so DISAPPOINTED with a sequel more than DUNGEON SIEGE II!
Following the innovative and brilliant original DS, the anticipation was so great that minor flaws would be forgiven. With DS2, though, it was one big blunder after another.

Contrary to the original DS (for which one had to physically tear himself from the computer screen) this one is a boring chore. Running back and forth to the base camp to barter equipement is a tedious procedure with all the fun sucked out of it. Moreover, no matter how much you improve your character (either leveling up or equipment-wise), your enemies simply match your abilities (or resort to crowding) resulting in NO CHANGE in the gameplay. I am not talking new enemies, but aren't higher leveled characters supposed to easily wipe out enemies encountered many hours before? This way, the whole game is nothing but a even-leveled blandness.

On a similar note: why was it necessary for **minor** enemies to have so much life? I was bored out of my skin hacking and slashing FOREVER! Increase the damage they can cause and keep it interesting - do not give them a longer life only to artificially increase the game's duration!
Oh, and the enchanting system was a joke - since the items found were much better than anything one could pay to have forged.

Graphically, DS2 is not even one step higher than the original DS. Shadows and particles may have increased, but characters (and equipment) have not. As a result, the heat of the battle (even on high-end systems) will find you in the midst of a disorienting...blur.

This is the...unavoidable expansion. It does not offer much more than a short campaign and some new trinkets. Importing your character from DS2 is a much better idea than choosing one of the badly-balanced pre-created ones - only...a persisting bug will not allow it!

This was the chronicle of a botched job foretold. With the exception of OBLIVION (which was an excellent game), one can count on 2K GAMES to...ruin any game franchise and kill its successful progress once and for all. Gaming history is littered with the relics of their failures: STRONGHOLD II, CIVILIZATION 4 (not until its expansion did this one became a playable game), SID MEIER's RAILROADS - the list is endless...They should probably stick to consoles.

I did not find that to be the case - I thought the handling was poor, lacking in feedback, and frustratingly slow to respond (and the worst is that clanging sound when you try to downshift, no matter how carefully and nowhere near the rev limiter, it will refuse to change gears about a third of the time so there's always an extra couple of paddle clicks).

So, what happened? The game we get is buggy, uninspired, repetitive, and contains poor multiplayer. Yes, it looks pretty and has multi-monitor support - but who cares? The gameplay is weak, and that is why people buy RTS (real time strategy) games.

General and Single Player Complaints:

- Single Player Campaigns too Short. There are roughly six missions for each of the three factions, and the first few for each faction are training missions.

- Single Player Factions Repetitive. The missions for each of the three factions are mirror-images of each-other with only slight modification. Ex: The map for Mission 6 of the Cybran campaign is the same as the map for Mission 6 of the UEF campaign. The goals are slightly different, but (for the most part) only slightly.

- Units are too similar. The units for each of the three factions are almost identicle, though there are slight modifications (the Tech 1 tank for Aeon may hover, while the same Tech-tank for the others does not).

- Linear Campaigns. There is no altering the ""fate"" of the game besides the initial choice of faction. If one general wants you to ""cleanse"" a civilian settlement and another does not, you'll have to do it if the computer says that is your objective - otherwise, the game does not continue.

- Unit limits include too many structures. At this time, building certain structures (including cement barricades) added to your total # of units - a number that has a ceiling. Which would you rather have, a tank that can kill the enemy or a single, immobile concrete barricade (that you'd need ten of to be useful?). The limits simply do not make sense.

- The AI is weak. Don't expect impressive techniques and strategies.

Multiplayer Complaints:

- Multiplayer games were EXTREMELY buggy at the time of this writing. There were known bugs that crashed 8 player games, build bugs, etc... Supreme Commander was simply not ready for multiplayer on release.

- GPGnet (Gas Powered Game's multiplayer connection network for Supreme Commander), is poorly designed. Example: It will load the Supreme Commander Game (taking time and comp resources) when entering a mission room - instead of just using the chat client. Considering many missions fail to launch (parameters change constantly since there is no way to NOT post a mission before setting them), this is simply annoying.

- Lack of Valid Opponents. Most players do not have computers that can support large-scale battles with multiple opponents. Prepare for the game to desync or for people to crash out on a regular basis.

- ""Teching Up"" is still not perfected. Rushers tend to beat techers 9 times out of 10 at the time of this writing. Techers have to use a standard ""playbook"" in order to get anywhere.

- Experimental unit balance is lacking. The experimental units for certain factions are far superior to others.

General Praise:

- The ending and movies for each faction are different, and lends to overall enjoyment.

- Multi-Monitor support is interesting (if you use two monitors).

- The graphics are impressive (for a RTS game).

2.0,True,"11 9, 2010",A2RK3LRI7VKKCF,B0028IBTLG,M. Edgar,"Ok, I am a huge Bethesda Fan, as far as games go.  The stories and over all play.  I have really been disappointed in them with Fallout 3 and FLNV though, because of the complete lack of quality control in the final releases of these games.

Gameplay
The good.
The game is great fun.  If you liked Fallout 3 you will most likely enjoy FLNV.

The Bad.
FLNV uses the same graphic set as Fallout 3 basically.  Example.  Dave's office from Fallout 3.  I ran across this same exact building and interior 3 times in FLNV.  Only change was the arrangement of the furniture inside.  This made FLNV feel more like an addon to me than a new game.  I don't mind reusing textures, but the laziness of just copying buildings and layouts over is chump programming.

Crafting.  Worthless.  I crafted and improved weapons just enough to get the trophies.  If it had not been for trophies (I plat'd this game) the crafting would be pointless.  You get more than enough money in game to buy stimpacks and the rest of craftables are just worthless.  Same with ammo.  Never used any perk to improve loot pick ups and in hardcore, I still had way more ammo than I could ever carry.

The unacceptable.
Crashing.  Just as with Fallout 3, the Havoc engine has many memory flaws in it that can't be corrected by the game designers.  This game just as the last, crashes and it crashes hard.  The longer you play into the game, the more it crashes.  The bigger your save files become, the more it crashes.  This is a known issue obviously since Bethesda has been dealing with it for such a long time now.  It's obvious that nothing will ever be done about it.  Nothing was done about it on Fallout 3 and nothing will be done about it with FLNV.  They will fix scripting errors and maybe some graphic glitches, but the crashing is here to stay.  Forever.

What you can do about it.

Play the game or don't.  That's about it.  For me, because I love the story and there just aren't many games of this type on the market, I played in spite of the crashing.  For the first 20 hours or so I never did get a crash.  By the end of the game, it was crashing every half hour or so, maybe a bit longer.  Just depends on what you are doing.

What you can do to limit the crashing.
1. Never play from a load within the game.  If you want to reload, quit the game out (even restart your ps3) and play from the load clean.  This will reduce most of your crashing to almost zero.

2. If you do play from load within the game, don't fast travel too much without restarting.  Loading new or many textures and areas will cause the crash.  If you zone into an area and notice any stuttering (like the normal small pauses you always get) right off the bat, then save the game there and quit out and restart.  You will almost always crash within a few minutes if you don't.

3. For me and for many others, this was a certain problem area.  If you use the gate to Freeside and move to the corner gate where the casino criers are, save your game there on the street before you get to the criers.  I didn't alway reload here because it didn't always crash me, but it did often.  I would say there was about a 25% chance it would crash just as I got to the kid barking for Mick n Ralphs.

That's it.  I got stuck in rocks a few times and saw some pretty lazy programming during the game, but I still loved it.  This would be a 5+ star game for sure if it were not for the terrible programming issues.  Hopefully the long in the tooth Havok engine will be mothballed for the next Fallout installment.

1. Get one character to 74.
2. Run Ramparts on insane over and over to level one of each class leveled to 74.
3. Buy gear at shops. Don't even try to farm an upgrade. Don't buy it if it's not mythical. Don't spend money leveling it if it's not level 100+. I'm not sure if I would level anything under level 150.
4. Run Alchemy labs on insane survival (4 hour + run). Collect all loot and sell between waves. Level your gear with the money gained. Max all your gear. The run is worth 100 million.
5. Once maxed, Uber monster fest (UMF) on insane over and over for... nothing? Solo you'll get pretty much nothing. You need a team of at least 4 to get anything worth keeping. In reality, you'll never get anything worth keeping long on insane mode, but I really enjoy being backed into a corner and shooting at Ogre belly.
6. Either you're really done with this game or you need to decide: Buy hacked gear with USD from the store, or, find an amazing group of folks that have maxed gear and want to carry you through stuff cause they're nice. Those folks will more than likely have hacked 200+ gear already so you'll save yourself a few bucks.

You can save yourself much effort just by doing step 1, then skip to step 6. In the end, it doesn't even matter.

Sadly, this game has some great potential. None of it realized in the current form. It's not an MMO. Why the best stuff only drops with big teams is stupid. Skill and determination should have something to do with gear drops - it doesn't. I've spent less time Raiding than a DD farming/money run.

Combine the above with the most unstable multi-player solution in existence, and I'm surprised anyone even bothers with this game. Trendy. NET decides to kick you out of game randomly, usually this involves Valves Steam service as it's actually running Trendy. NET. Valve doesn't really seem to care. Trendy can't do anything cause it's a Valve problem. The cost to you is hours of effort gone forever as there's no save option.

What I like:

The army units can take cover in three different types of cover. Depending on the cover, your unit will be given a green shield, yellow shield, or red. This adds a little dynamic to the game, because depending on where your unit is on the map, you will either be well protected or a sitting duck.
The sounds and graphic affects make for a fun game.

You can blow up just about any obstacle in the playing field; such as, artilary, buildings, walls, bushes, even craters are formed in the ground from explosions.

What I don't like about the game and what makes it poor:

You can't zoom out very far.

Rifleman have to exit a building in order to throw grenades or sticky bombs.

I couldn't play my style of RTS. The game forces you to play a certain way. For instance, on one level I was taking control of more strategic points and the game automatically made me take control of the point that makes the german's attack.

The population cap has to be the worst. You can produce very few units before you're told you've reached your population cap. I couldn't build up an army to defend important points on the map. This did not allow for a defensive gameplay style. What I had to end up doing, was just building tanks only and sending those to the enemy's base. This was very effective, but removed the usefulness of the other unit types and their abilities. Afterall, why produce infantry when you can use that population point on a tank? If the tank gets destroyed, just build another...

This gameplay reminds me of the silliness of the old Starcraft and Warcraft. Once you find the dominant unit type, there is no need to bother with the other units. Just mass produce them and send them over to the enemies base. Simple, no strategy required.

Of all the levels I've played, there doesn't seem to be any need for strategy. I feel like I'm playing a shooter from birds-eye-view. I feel forced to play the style of ""Offense"" only and if I choose to have fun by playing a variety of unit types, my effectiveness will suffer.

The good
I believe 10 new characters. High price just for an expansion when it first came out 40 bucks should be only 20 or at least go as low as 30.(but no one anyone asked for besides phoenix wright/vergil/hiryu)
Nemesis(biohazard 3), Hawkeye(avengers), Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, red devil(ghouls n ghost), Rocket Raccoon(marvel s way back work), Strider Hiryu, Iron Fist, Nova, and Phoenix wright.

New mode-addicting card mode

some old rosters have new moves

plenty of characters

character theme music survives

can turn each capcom characters englidh or jpnese voice when beat arcade mode just once.

The bad
The combat is aggressive and messy.(the game very broken,where even push block become useless to unbreakable pro constant offense)
 Infinite assist summon as long he alive and pro players know how to use assist to cover to openings in there offense to point where you have no chance to make a counter offensive without using the one time burst red mode. Infinite combos are too common. Chip damage is too high,giant unavoidable laser powers are too common,large characters or characters with limited maneuvers(Tron bonne/hulk/haggar/thor etc) cant avoid strong zoning and have no chance against characters like dr.doom.-being chipped to death. Meter can be built without even having to clean hit the opponent. At least ultra street fighter 4 has defensive,precise and way more well rounded combat this.-rewarding patience and good defense.
The older air combo games had better structure than this one. mvc2 was loose ruled too,but at least had the characters to back it up.

No balance in the roster, most low tiers have no chance against high tier characters.
 Forcing you to use high tiers in even skilled matches. You can use your characters but if there low tier prepare be killed by high tier a majority of time online. Example-Doom vs nemesis-nemesis is easily out maneuvered by fliers with strong zoning or just strong zoning. Some characters cant even deal with magneto s disrupter spam.

They didn't try give characters people wanted.
Roster consist characters no asked besides strider hiryu, phoenix wright, dante, vergil- people wanted venom,mega man would of been better than many of the ones that no one wanted. Resident evil characters are not for the true fan base of biohazard.-representative are all biohazard 5 versions which biohazard 5 isn't considered a true survival/horror biohazard game.(Jill looks so far off her better version,shes a brainwashed ninja now for some odd reason.) Im pretty sure no one wanted red devil from ghouls n ghost. Hayato has only been in one game why no return? Rubyheart had a interesting move set as well. Jin s robot would had amazing visual treat, seeing a fully rendered blodia robot. Ryu from breathe of fire 3-one of capcoms best rpg character.-seeing him turn into kaiser dragon from 3 would been great. Characters from warzard. So much wasted potential. I could go on but you get point. Most marvel characters are just cause they had a movie.

Did forget they how to do great 2d fighters like history has proven.
 (see Warzard,darkstalkers,Street fighter Third strike,Alien vs Predator,dungeons and dragons,mega man 8 are capcoms 2d treasures)The 3d nice looking but not why older fans love there games, old fans appreciated the hard work on great 2d sprite animation like jins, captain commando, mega man s and venoms in the 1st mvc. Its like they forgot that one of the things made them great is beautiful 2d works. 2d has made great strides if you look at dragons crown-highly regarded rpg beat em up,dengeki bunko fighting climax and under night in birth fighters-sprties are very detailed. Even guilty gear xrd does better job of retaining its trademark look.-kept the fans in mind.

Had better voice actors in previous air combo games.
 Captain America sounds like hes chewing gum everytime he talks. Storm just sounded better in previous games. Steve blum a good wolverine but cannot replace the orignal better voice over. Listen to dr doom in marvel super heroes when hes says ""now you face doom."" sound alot better. Magneto past actor is better as well. Marvel used top class talent for the voice actors.-xmen animated series(the one with the revered opening) had masters at there voicce over careers. Now its seems marvel doesnt really care.

Must pay for jill and shuma gorath if haven't preorder the 1st game of this that has dlc code. You would think they should be free since your paying 40 bucks for an expansion when this first expansion hit the shelf.

Not that much replay value outside of training, online/offline versus 2 modes-card mode(forgot name),arcade

Horrible records which to be expected.-the new low standards capcom lives by now.

Galactus was straight forward and easy, a disappointment really compared to mvc2 last boss which even had more creativity and its my most hated design,Third strikes gill, mvc1 onslaught and tsunoko okami last boss are plenty better/giving a strong fight.

Just makes for an even more tighter fit if you plan to place games in there as well.

Another thing to mention is that this case SMELLS HORRIBLE!!! I cant quite even put it into words what it smells like, but its the inside of the case that smells horrid.

It is a decent case. Just wish it was very slightly more spacious for storing games and a charging cable (I have a NDS to USB charging cable that I currently place in there, but its a tight fit).

I wouldn't order this unless you are OK with possibly not getting what is pictured. But the alternative is not so bad either. Especially considering the price.

Hope this helps.

***UPDATED 03/26/13

WOW!!! Ive owned this case for about 2 weeks now and I would have thought it would have aired out by now, but DAMN!!! The smell is just as potent as it was the first day I got it. I even sprayed it with tons of strong cologne and let it air out for days, but it still smells horrible.

I had my 3DS in it for a few days and now my 3DS smells horrible as well.

I believe I will let it air outside when it gets nicer, but for the cost and trouble, I might just buy another case and toss this one in the trash.

I'm not a very picky person, but this smell is not something I care to deal with. And its also not worth the price of the return shipping as the company does not pay for it (even though I received a different item than was pictured).

I do not recommend this case (the case that you might receive that is not pictured). I can not comment on the actual case that IS pictured as I do not have that one.",Did not receive the case picture and HORRIBLE SMELL!  *** UPDATED 3/28,1363305600,22,,

I had the original NFS Most Wanted on PS2.  I LOVED that game, everything about it was awesome (and granted, I had a long list of things that also bugged the sheisse out of me, but everything else really made up for it overall).  In particular, the handling felt good (not necessarily ""realistic"", but sensible and controllable for what it was) when using a wheel and pedals.  NOT SO ON THIS VERSION.  I started up the game, and immediately noticed the steering (using a Fanatec CSR) was AWFUL.  Also, it seems to have only an automatic transmission, so if you're used to a manual and having that control of the car using the paddle shifters, yeah you don't get that anymore.  And, the brakes don't actually work all that well - they feel either on or off, plus you're supposed to ""tap"" the brake to make it toggle into some kind of drift mode.  Combined with the lack of shifting or good steering, poor braking means an extremely sluggish and frustrating experience anytime you're not just going straight on full throttle.

Bad handling is even more irritating because this game only has two camera angles - either you use 3rd person ""chase"" cam (behind the car), or you use 1st person ""bumper"" cam (you see nothing but pavement in front of the car).  Chase cam lets you see how incredibly laggy the inputs are, too.  You know what makes the camera switch back and forth? The paddle shifters.

I did try to ignore the complete lack of any feeling of control of the car and just drove around for a while, and the city does look cool, but I got tired of crashing into things because there's no feel in the steering at all and you need three times the steering angle to make the front end point where you want it to go.  Again, feels like it's either doing nothing, or it is halfway on, or it is all the way on.  No subtleties that you need when driving at the high speeds this game was built for.

So incredibly glad I got this for only $15 and not its full $60 price.  Even $15 is kind of a waste if you ask me.","Looks good, sounds good, but utterly terrible handling",1396396800,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It requires internet connection to install the game, first to install Windows Live and then Steam.  Then the game installs, only with internet connection, and yet again, internet connection is needed to run the game the 1st time.

This is not good for those of us using air cards or other wireless services, where we pay by the amount of data.  If you have an internet service that charges by amount of data sent/ received, you seriously need to reconsider prior to purchasing this game.

If you are in the military and serving in Iraq or Afghanistan AVOID this game!  Without an unclassified internet connection, you can not install or play this game.  We all know that trying to connect a personal computer on a government LAN is not good.  It's not like Time Warner or Comcast is available for internet service overseas.

What is frustrating is that you are required to create accounts before playing the game. If you are unable to play the game (in my case insufficient graphics card capability, even after updates) you'll have wasted a lot of time, not to mention the cost of this game.

Had the game loaded with the option to conduct a graphics card and system check prior to installing, it would have prevented the past three hours of frustration, and the need to create the account.

Wish that game developers would offer free program to download and test our systems before we purchase the game.  Would have saved $50+.

Also missing are the uninstall options for the Windows Live, Steam, and DoW2.  Uninstalls have to be performed manually and make sure you check for hidden files and folders too.

I played the game for 3 hours and just got frustated. I am pretty good at street fighter but Zangief is a cheat on this game he endures attacks and then grabs you repeatedly and its hard to stop.

Yes, they have in the description that this console version was written from the ground up, so that does provide an excuse.  So to be fair, all I will say is that this version is nothing like the computer version.  It has very few similarities at best and the game play is very different.  They obviously made this for the casual gamer.  Serious gamers will think this version is a joke.

To call this a next generation game would be an insult.  The graphics are sub-par at best and is really nothing better than you might see on the Wii console.  I am not knocking the Wii, I am just providing a comparison.  This console version also lacks the many wonderful musical scores from the PC version.

Background: I was new to the Xbox and to consoles in general, having always been a PC gamer before 2012.

Pros:
The idea was interesting, especially since I had played warrior mages in MMPORGs and role playing(pen and  paper) games before.

I found the breadth and depth of the story fascinating, and the cutscene videos were entertaining.

The number and variety of side missions give you plenty to do in addition to the main story.

Cons:
Controls are not for the faint of heart. You'll find yourself browsing menu wheels, potions trees, skill trees, spell trees more often than you'd like.

Fighting goes like this. Save game. Check out your enemy. Leave. Make a plan of attack.  Create and drink the appropriate potions. Create and apply the appropriate oils to the appropriate sword. Select the appropriate spell as your default, and memorize the 2nd and 3rd spell's location on the spell wheel. Save again(for good measure), attack.  Why 2 saves? the 1st save is if you didn't get the spells, oils, potions, weapon etc right the first time. After you fail to kill the enemy 5 or 6 times, you might want to change your plan. The second save is if you want to try again with the same setup.  <- If this is your idea of fun , then this game is for you.

Lopsided difficulty - side quests and even battles have a very uneven difficulty level. I did an arm-wrestling quest and beat all of my opponents easily before challenging the current champion. Even if he was 2-3 times as good as the 2nd place opponent, I could take him.  I didn't stand a chance. After 20-30 tries, I gave up.  Battles are similar, you'll be breezing through your opponents and then hit an unbreakable wall the defies your unstoppable force. Impass.

Graphics are so-so, late 90's early 2000's level.

Spell Names - The are written in a foreign tongue. I cannot look at the spell and know what it does. The shield spell ""Quen"" should be named, oh, I don't know, ""shield?"" The fireball spell could be called..um...""Fireball?"" Orb of fire? Flaming ball? Any of these would better than ""Igni"".

Summary
There is a lot to like here. Variety of missions and opponents. Deep lore. Fun things to do like beat up peasants and rob them. But the non-intuitive controls , the overly complicated menus, obtuse combat system, and lack of consistency in difficulty led me to put this game on Craigslist. I feel sorry for whomever buys it.

As a side note, I think that this game would be a lot more enjoyable on PC, as long as they replace the menu wheels with hotkeys.","Good idea, bad execution(xbox)",1374969600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
2.0,False,"05 28, 2003",A2L8S4KG702SFT,B00006JC48,Amazon Customer,"Here are the pros and cons of the game; I'll discuss each after the list
Pros
Above Average Graphics
Many different Weapons
Large Game play
Cons
Linear game play
Save feature is also BS
Unrealistic game play at times
Difficulty settings are BS

Pros
From the start, this game looked good.  The first mission is awesome; you hit the beach and have to fight though the chaos of the situation.  The next pro is the number of weapons was great.  You get to use several different weapons for each war situation.  The sniper rifle is a personal fav.  The last pro deals with the size of the game.  From what I have read; there are 19 missions, so this is not a game that you can finish in an afternoon.
Cons
The first con is that this game is that it does not allow for you to do anything other then the list of chore list from your mission list.  So it becomes like a list of chores.  The game even has a list of chores that get checked off as you complete them.
Next, there is no in level save feature.  So in the longer missions you have to be careful not to die at the end of the level, or else you have to do the whole level over again. SO you can spend hours doing the same thing over and over and over again.  I understand that this is suppose to make the game more challenging, but if I have to do a level over 10 times, I will not think, ""Boy that was challenging and fun.""  I'm more likely to think, ""Boy, this game ... .""  The X-Box has a 10 gig HD, why do developers not create in level saves?  It is not like we will run out of HD space!!!
Unrealistic game play takes away from the game.  You can have the shot gun and sneak up on a Nazi.  You then shoot him in the back of the head.  And guess what!!!  He gets up and starts shooting at you!!!!  I understand that one shoot-one kill would not work in a video game, but what the hell!!  A shot gun blast in the back of the head does not kill a Nazi, UNREALISTIC!!!!!!
Ok, my last complainant, The difficulty level in the game is total BS.  I was playing and came upon a mission entitled, ""Arnhem Knights"".  After 5 times of dieing in the middles of this level, I switched the difficulty to easy.  But guess what, I died another 5 times.  Let me give a bit of background to this mission.  You have to fight Nazi's through the streets.  You travel along with a platoon of British soldiers.  First, one would think that having computer led friends shooting at the Nazi's would be helpful, but you would be wrong.  The Brits more or less get in your way and never seem to do anything but die.  So this leaves you to kill the over 150 Nazi's plus the two tanks that are on this level.  I hate to complain, but I do not know of many foot soldiers in World War II that killed over 150 Nazi's in one street battle and also took out two tanks in the process.
All in all, I give it two out of five.  So rent if there is nothing else at the store to rent and you need a video game fix.  Shame on you EA for releasing this game",Suffers from the same troubles as many X-Box Titles,1054080000,,,

The weight of the controller is very light, as this is due to the fact it doesnt have a rumble device in it. The control sticks, buttons, and shoulder triggers all feel clucky and cheap. It was difficult to make prescise button presses at high speeds. The buttons also made loud clicking noises that were louder than your typical controller. You also need to press down on the buttons harder than other controllers for them to actually retract and register. The shoulder buttons are sometimes inconsistent at detecting input, not because they aren't detected, but because you need to press hard on them at a specific angle.

2.0,False,"08 12, 2016",A2NOJVQUPKPTEI,B01CINIAKS,R. Pickman,"Like many, I was excited for No Man's Sky. Allow me to provide you with my frame of reference in anticipation of the title. I love the Fallout titles. While you CAN complete the Fallout games in about 10 hours or so, I generally put 150+ hours into them. This is because I love traversing the wasteland, seeing a structure in the distance and heading towards it. Not because the game tells me to, but because of the excitement of what I will find inside. I'll spend hours and hours just wandering for no other reason to check out what's over that hill or to rifle through old papers in an abandoned factory. When No Man's Sky was touted as an exploration game, this is what I expected, only in space and much MUCH larger.

This was delivered on zero levels... I cringe when the term ""procedurally generated"" is used in the description of any game. Why? Because that means instead of taking the time to hand-craft a world with life and purpose and intrigue, you've decided to craft thousands of lines of code and let the cold/lifeless/emotionless/unimaginative machine figure out the rest. This is ever present in No Man's Sky. It's a game where you see an odd game mechanic and instantly realize the only reason it exists is so no developer had to actually DO something. It's a Choose Your Own Adventure book with no plot or consequence. It's a game about nothing in a universe where nothing happens. If you're still on the fence, continue reading. If you're preparing to flame me in the comments, I'm glad that you like the game specifically, but I couldn't care less about your counter-arguments.

So, the game about exploration. The spirit of exploration, the very crux of the practice itself, is finding something new and unique. You'll be hard pressed to satisfy this criteria even 3 hours into the game. Buildings all look the same and no matter their size you will only be allowed in one room usually with one alien until you can craft keys. Interacting with the items in the room and/or the alien will get you blueprints (which take up no space on there own, but when crafted are mostly useless upgrades and do little more than take up precious inventory space), units - aka money - (which have limited purpose in the grand scheme of the game) or sometimes random items that you can trade for units or blueprints. Flora and fauna all look surprisingly similar even across planets. They do however change the names so it may SEEM like you're discovering more. In the end though, a cylindrical rock formation made of iron is a cylindrical rock formation made of iron no matter the name and you'll find them everywhere. This is especially frustrating as you try to catalog your findings and find that, even though you know you've cataloged a creature, this one is actually somehow different so you just need to scan everything you come across. While some planets are truly a sight to behold, most are desolate wastelands with varying atmospheric conditions, taxing your suit and your resources, with seemingly little more differentiation than a color pallet swap. Exploration proves fruitless very early on and doesn't get any better. Enter a planet's atmosphere, do a fly over the terrain, is it pretty? (yes, land, check it out), is it an ugly/craggy wasteland? (yes, leave and head to the next planet), repeat.

Another fun fact: the game about exploration has no map. That's right, when you're on a planet, there is no map to speak of. Not even a Diablo-esque black screen that updates as you wander. ""Have I been here before?"" You'll wonder. ""WHO KNOWS!"" the game will undoubtedly reply. A revelation that makes it clear that even the developers knew nothing would be worth visiting twice.

The animals mostly act skittish and just run around in the distance. You'll likely stop noticing them. The aggressive carnivores are few and far between and are easily dispatched in unsatisfying fashion as they just charge you - dealing damage if they come into contact. No grappling jaws, knock downs or interesting abilities. They could be untextured spheres or cubes and achieve the same lifeless effect.

That's the problem with the universe that is No Man's Sky. For something so abundant with worlds and species, there is no life to be found. I mentioned the aliens. Most of the structures you will enter have a single alien inside holding a clipboard. You will approach the alien and  instead of a scenario playing out before you  a text box appears detailing what is supposed to be happening. What is this, a MUD? The Alien stands there blinking at you while you read (and I guess imagine) what is supposed to be going on. You make a selection from a list of choices and a text box appears telling you what the outcome was. Regardless of the outcome you may then still interact with the alien as if nothing happened.

Example: I approached an alien. A text box appeared stating that, as I entered, I witnessed a room full of open vaults and this alien transferred items into his inventory. Keep in mind that while Im reading this, we stand in an empty room, no vaults, and the alien just stares at me blinking occasionally. Im presented with three choices; tell the alien to give YOU everything, tell the alien to share, report the alien to the authorities. I elected to report the alien to authorities. The text box updated that I had reported the alien and that he was being punished accordingly. I confirmed and was rewarded with reputation gains from that race. Yet nothing changed. The same alien still stood there in the same empty room. I approached him to speak with him again. He greeted me happily and was glad to accommodate my request of teaching me a new word. The choice I made resulted in NOTHING. He wasn't mad at me, no one came and took him away, even what I was supposed to be witnessing never actually occurred. But its fine because its all in the spirit of procedural generation of assets.

This is the gameplay of No Mans Sky. Approach something, read text, make a choice, collect a reward or take damage. All the while, nothing actually happens on screen.

In addition to exploration, its also a game about resource management and survival. When you are outside your ship, your life support system will experience constant drain. If there are conditions in the atmosphere (toxicity, radiation, extreme temperature), your environmental apparatus will drain (same thing for all conditions apparently). You will need to replenish these items by using various materials you find. However, the materials require are plentiful and generally youll just stroll over to the crystal clusters youve been passing every 10 feet, blast it with your mining tool and you're good. It feigns survival through tedium. Your ships resources require fuel also, but most is readily available and requires minimal effort. It is inconsistent at best and nonsensical at worst.

For instance, you require fuel to take off from the ground. UNLESS you're on a landing pad or next to a landing beacon. Then you inexplicably can take off for free. Theres no animations showing any hidden mechanisms that allow this feat, it just happens. The fuel to take off is plentiful, but you can only leave terra firma 4 times per full tank, which equates to mild annoyance more than survival. You do not require fuel to stay aloft or speed through the atmosphere, however. Gravity operates under the laws of developer convenience in No Mans Sky as further evident in the next paragraph. No Mans Sky is a game about resource management Sometimes When we thought of it

Consider this; I see the HAVOK physics logo prominently displayed in the opening. Im wandering across the first planet I find myself on. I see a large monolith of gold. I use my mining tool and am pleased to see that I can harvest the precious ore using the default tool. Feeling curious, I cut a swath clean through the base, expecting lumberjackian results. Much to my dismay, the upper 90% of the obelisk stays aloft  exactly where it was. So, tons of gold stay aloft inexplicably, but it takes a quarter tank of straight Plutonium to get my little spacecraft off the ground. Sure, why not?

Atmospheric conditions are strange also. For instance, the planet has a toxic atmosphere and its raining. I walk onto a platform for ship parking. There is a roof, but no walls. My sensors tell me that the air is no longer toxic and the rain continues through the roof as if it isn't there No Mans Sky is Science Fiction; easy on the science.

Overall, the game is a battery-powered battery charger thats only good for charging its own batteries. You fly to a planet to collect resources so you can fly to a planet to collect resources so you can And so on. The structures and people offer no narrative of any substance to reward the intrepid wanderer. You will find yourself frequenting structures less and less because you already know that there is nothing in the way of knowledge or material that makes it a worthwhile endeavor. Im hoping that the developers will do a major overhaul, because the concept and foundation exist (albeit buried deep under banality).

2.0,False,"12 25, 2012",A2H0M6QFR26HVA,B0050SYV70,Arg,"I will preface this by saying that I am one of the few that seems to have given Far Cry 2 enough of a chance to figure out why that game was great. It is probably one of my favorite games ever made for the way it didn't lead the player by the hand, let you play your own way, rewarded players for slow, careful approaches, and introduced unique dynamic story components that allowed players to make their own experience by presenting them with a series of dynamic mechanics (the buddies) instead of a series of set-pieces, QTE's and cut scenes. Suffice to say, I don't consider Far Cry 3 a bad game, but rather a bad sequel to an ambitious, but flawed title that has really been overlooked in the years since its release. It certainly fixes some of the problems of the previous game, but generally does so by entirely removing entire mechanics instead of making them more accessible (the worst example being the base take overs). I will be focusing on the flaws of the game here, because no one else bothers to. Its strengths have been covered generously and perhaps excessively at this point.

On a fundamental level, Far Cry 3 is an attempt by Ubisoft to remove every single element of the previous game that wouldn't appeal to the widest possible audience and replace it with mechanics lifted blatantly from other games and, quite often, executed worse. The most immediately obvious example being the towers that you have to climb (complete with the terrible, scripted pseudo-platforming that seems to be required in all AAA action games now) to reveal sections of the map. Only, instead of setting it on fire, you rip open a breaker, and instead of jumping into a bail of hay, you use a zip-line. Not only is it a shallow and repetitive way to add ""content"" to the game, but Assassin's Creed did it better already. And that is just one example of many that prevent this game from being deserving of any Game of the Year awards. It is a prettied up Frankenstein monster of game mechanics that contribute nothing to the cohesiveness and immersiveness of the world (2 things that FC2 focused on that were entirely abandoned here), thrown together for the sake of commercial appeal. And, judging by the widespread, excessive praise for this title, it has clearly worked. If anything has been proven this generation, it's that GTA3 style sandboxes full of pointless diversions, repetitive side missions, and collectibles is the quickest way to everyone cover up a game's flaws in favor of the fact that you can wander around between linear missions. Instead of creating a living, breathing world with interesting inhabitants and engrossing detail, it presents a very large map populated with color-coded mannequins that either crazy sods on your side or crazy sods that arbitrarily hate you the entire game, and stuffed to bursting with piles of inane diversions with no attention to a cohesive setting. Instead of showing how sandbox games can be different, it demonstrates exactly why they need to be.

The game clearly tries to appeal to the very large audience of the Elder Scrolls games, but with very little regard to sense, balance, immersion, or pacing. The hunting system, that is so frequently lauded, essentially boils down to a fetch quest involving going to the location on your map that is marked with the right kind of animal among the ludicrous variety of animals that would not actually live in this environment, getting a certain number of ""skins"" so that you can make an arbitrary item that makes playing the game a bit less of a pain in the ass. Want to carry more than 2 grand at a time? Worry not, spoiled rich kid with no access to anything like a bank account, you must simply get 4 skins of an animal that is not a pig because that's how getting a bigger wallet works! It's a contrived, gimmicky excuse to pat the player on the head for doing something worthless. Then there's the skill system, which is effectively just a list of ""special moves"" that they took away from the player to justify this progression and some health upgrades. In the context of the (poor) narrative, it would seem to be a justified by the progression of Jason (who is a self-centered douche) from a spoiled wussy rich prick into the ultimate personification of Rambo by the end (because power trips are cool). Unfortunately, they refused to use any of their mechanics to meaningfully reinforced this growth, because the average player doesn't like to feel weak. The only thing really holding you back at the beginning of the game is your health, not Jason's lack of skill. He has impeccable aim and seems to have absolutely no problem casually jamming a machete into a pirate's neck after the initial opening sequence. In the very first relatively unscripted encounter in the game, I was more than capable of taking out the base with the skill and efficiency of an experienced, trained killer. Jason is an expert with all guns, blades, and bows as soon as he picks then up. Is the fact that they won't let me take down enemies from above supposed to make me feel somehow weak? No. It just feels like a contrived excuse to give me that option later. And this is compounded by the fact that the previously mentioned hunting system is in no way grounded in your fight for survival. There is no vital need to be filled by poaching these animals. It is simply a matter of convenience. Specifically, the developers inconvenienced you at the beginning and you have to kill some goats to fix that problem (i.e. carrying more than one weapon). Another example of the developer taking away things the player SHOULD have so they can turn them into a progression system later. Which is, in my opinion, the worst kind of ""RPG-lite"" implementation.

And then there's the story. If the interviews with the writer are any indication, it is a poor, cliche-ridden story being justified post release as a satire of those game stories, or it's just a intentional, but still poor satire of those stories. Either way, it is not very well done. The game presents you as a spoiled, rich, white kid stranded on an island with some family and friends. Most of your friends are forgettable stereotypes that fail to develop in any significant way (and then there's the overt implications of rape that they handle incredibly poorly for one of your male friends). While I agree that this story had a lot of potential at the beginning, I think my opinion of when it went downhill may differ from many. It started getting worse after the first missions. Here's why. As I said, at the beginning of the game the developers seem to be setting the player up for an interesting, desperate, and potentially brutal fight for survival. A city kid thrown in the jungle and forced to learn how to survive or die. They seemed to want the player to reflect on the wanton violence and destruction they cause throughout the game, if characters and even Jason's sole redeeming dialogue in one of the endings is any indication, but they never present it as such. In a game like Spec Ops: The Line, combat is presented as necessary, but still evil. In this game, blowing up a couple dozen cars with a grenade launcher from the back of a jeep is described in-game as ""awesome."" Don't mistake me, I have nothing in particular against violence in games, but if you're going to try to make a thoughtful critique, you can't just throw it in a couple of times throughout a standard, mindless, action game. Every single thing they present in this game as something unique and in-depth is only really implied to be, when the execution is almost invariably shallow, standard, ""gamey"" s***. They make a point of patting the player on the head for every minor accomplishment and then at the end, they expect you to feel bad for enjoying it. And this happens in the story, the mechanics, and the level design. On the plus side, the VA for Vaas, however poorly implemented the character may have been in the overall story arc, was excellent and certainly a highlight in the course of the game.

Finally, there is the overworld map: a hyperactive mess, stuffed to the brim with loot chests that add literally nothing of worth to the game except to create middle point between the player and spendable currency, a few boring and repetitive side activities that cover the map in nearly endless repetition, some relics to collect for no apparent reason, and the most stripped down, pitiful ""quests"" I have ever seen. It comes off as an attempt to meld the overused formula from Rockstar that was innovative over ten years ago, with a much, much less interesting version of Bethesda's formula (complete with some of the saddest dungeon design I have ever seen). Like most open world games, it makes a point of emphasizing all that you can do, but aside from the base capturing, which empties the map of enemies because they ran in the opposite direction of each and every complaint ever leveled at the previous title, it's mostly filler put in place so that players don't get bored during their 30 second drive from the excessive number of fast travel points to their objective. Unlike a game like Deus Ex (1 and 3), the content they packed into this world has no context and contributes nothing to the interest of the world itself, but serves simply to fill this big sandbox with cheap toys. It retains many of the dynamic elements of the previous game's combat encounters, but provides only 1 (well, 34) place(s) where the player can actually utilize it, as the story missions are linear to the point that you can get mission failure for something as simple as diving into the water instead of going through their poor excuse for a stealth level. And, as we all know, the key to stealth is magical distraction rocks! The only real variety that is added in the course of the game are your usual ""heavies"" that do too much damage and make no sense. A 50 caliber round is the only thing that can get through that mask? No, that would remove their head and a good piece of their upper body with it, but I suppose that makes sense given the brick wall that is the edge of weapon range in this game. These elements are decent fun for a while, but get tired and repetitive far before the game reaches its conclusion.

Far Cry 3 is by no means a bad game as it stands, but it accomplishes so much less than it could have or has gotten credit for. It is graphically appealing (though, I didn't bother to get it on PC), the controls are generally responsive, the level design is generally pretty good, the weapons generally felt good and effective, enemies were not bullet sponges, and they paid some good attention to make traversal in vehicles and on foot pretty enjoyable. I mostly enjoyed playing through this game once, but it is not a unique experience, aside from the dynamic wildlife that seems to have been arbitrarily selected from several entirely different places in the world. It is not generation defining. It did not do anything new. It is a game that provides simple, stupid fun on a surface level and entirely falls short of its potential for thought-provoking dynamic experience that doesn't pander to the player on a near constant basis. When games like Dishonored and XCOM have presented hardcore, intelligent game design that remains accessible to wide audiences as well, it's hard for me to hold this game up as anything more than a decently fun, derivative sandbox title and a disappointing sequel to Far Cry 2. This is a prime example of why the medium needs to evolve past its open world roots in Rockstar.","Another big, dumb sandbox game lauded for stale design.",1356393600,20,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For starters, the headset features a fairly large inline volume control box. Unlike typical volume controls, this one allows you to control various parts of the sound (i.e. Front, Rear, etc). These extra features increase the size of the box to the point where it may annoying you. Perhaps the largest issue with the box is the fact that the two wires that go into each side of it seem to come loose after wear and tear.

The rubber piece that appears like it should be holding the wire in place is not doing its job. My wires are rotating and pulling out of the inline volume control box. Very bad! Luckily, they stay as long as you don't pull too much on them, so I check every so often to make sure the wire has not been pulled out. Regardless, it's hard to endorse a product when it has such a large and potentially breaking issue.

Another issue is with the cheap plastic used to cover the headphone portion. The headphone band is connected to the speaker portion of the headphones via some sort of axis that allows the speaker portions to have very slight angular movement so that it'll fit different heads better. Placing these headphones on my head causes the angle of the axis to bend outwards, thus putting a small amount of pressure on the outer gray plastic. This has caused the gray plastic to chip away. A piece of this chipped away gray plastic has gotten inside my headphones somewhere and rattles around.

Lastly, the setup for these headphones is a bit convoluted. It requires a large gray box that connects to various power cords. It is very ugly and very messy. I am using these headphones on a PC. Using the gray box in conjunction with my sound card caused a ""whining"" or ""hissing"" noise, so I stopped using it and just used the digital input rather than the optical. If you're buying for the PC, I would check out their USB headphones instead.

I debated on giving these headphones a 4. Heck, if I just rated the headphones on comfort alone, this headset would get a 5. When it comes down to it, I just can't give it a 4. The product has too many potentially ""fatal"" problems with it. It's a great headset, I just wish the part quality was as up to par as the rest of the headset. For this price, you should not be worrying about whether or not a wire is going to stay in place or not.

Update: The plastic surrounding the headphone axis finally chipped away enough to where the right headphone can now detach, hanging by a single wire. I have since replaced this headset and will be dropping the score to a 2 because of the ""fatal"" problem. This headset is just not made well enough and there are better products out there for a similar price.","Comfort and quality, but has breaking issues",1300492800,,,

2.0,False,"11 18, 2007",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B000UUFR12,NeuroSplicer,"This is a game that enjoys one of the most SOLID story-lines that came out of game developing in the last 3 years. Unfortunately, this was NOT enough.

You are Kane, an aged mercenary and former member of a criminal brotherhood known as The 7. The last heists failed, you get arrested and convicted - yet you are a traitor in The 7's books anyway. Having you for making off with the loot somehow, they send Lynch (a psychotic, easily distracted and pill-popping murderer) to first break you out of prison and then make sure he gets their money back. They are sure you will play ball: they have kidnapped your wife and daughter to ensure it.

Now this is a foundation to built a GREAT TPS game! Unfortunately KANE & LYNCH does not reach the top floor as the game demonstrates all the flaws of a rushed release.

The character movements feel too scripted and automatic at some places (a console left-over I guess) whereas they have to be spoon-fed detailed directions at some others. Since one cannot predict where the one or the other will occur, it will eventually get on your nerves.

The squad curse is not lifted for KANE & LYNCH either: the AI of your squad is infantile at best - but you will be thankful that your enemies do not demonstrate a higher one either!
Also, the game is pretty short: it shouldn't take you more than 7 hours on normal difficulty.

Graphically this is a beautiful game - notably though not at par with, say, CRYSIS. Keep in mind that the strength of KANE & LYNCH is its story.
The gameplay and the cut-scenes blend seamlessly and the story flows like an A-List movie. And you will definitely not get bored: from the inside of a prison, to rappelling from a skyscraper, to escaping a packed Tokyo dance club...

- The game is king of wait times, slow menu transitions and every chance to make you wait they do.
- You can't tune before a race. You must exit all the way to the main menu to tune your car. It doesn't sound bad until you factor in the massive load times to get to the tune menu and get back.
- Drivatars seem to be a joke. I can't view how my drivatar does statwise, and the money it make is a few thousands with random $5k days.
- With full damage on it seems that even before you get a ""damage"" alert on the screen you are taking damage. So that drivatar that just tried to drive through you going into a turn may have damaged your car, but you don't know because only major damage seems to be reported.
- It seems that with 16 cars getting packed into a corner, throw in some smoke, the FPS of the game tanks. Maybe that's just me, but I swear there is a huge dip in FPS with a dozen cars and some smoke.

2.0,False,"06 11, 2012",A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B00178630A,Nishi,"After picking up the annual pass last year, I was looking forward to playing this game. I haven't played the previous Diablo games and the only game I have played in this genre are the untold legends psp games (Guardian FTW) so I will just be basing this review on the game itself and not comparing it to the previous games.

Story:

The game takes place 20 years after the events of Diablo 2 an evil is back at it again. I really liked the story, and the cut-scenes were amazing to watch (especially act 1's end scene). You get a CGI cut-scene at the end of each act bringing you into the next. Throughout the course of each act you are given a drawn cut-scenes explaining what's happening so far with the hero you picked voicing it over.
My favorite part of the story though is being able to talk to all the important NPC's. The main characters have new topics to talk about each act, and even get new things to mention based on the quests you're on and what events have taken place. You can also talk to the Blacksmith and Jewel crafter; they even have dialog options before you obtained them when you play new game+.

Gameplay:

This is where the game is both really cool, but really annoying at the same time. The combat itself is really fun, and all the runes are mostly different from one another that make leveling quite fun. Basically you earn skills as you level, and the skills can be modified with runes (1 at a time for each skill) so your barbarian whirlwind could be on fire, or shoot smaller tornadoes from yourself. With elective mode you can put any skill on 1-4 numbers and left/right clicking.

With that said, you start being forced into a few builds in order to survive in inferno difficulty. To me this goes against the tons of variations you can choose from (Yes this is the hardest difficulty, but it was still something promised before the game came out). The skills can be reset at any time during the game, which really removes the reason to even level the same class again if you don't care about Achievements.

Also it seems that act 2+ in Inferno is one big gear check. Normally I wouldn't mind this, especially in game like this where gear is king, but they have stated that the existence of the Auction House factored in the op rate of items (Since people would use the auction house to buy better gear, instead of farming it). That worried me a bit after hearing that since the Real Money Auction House is coming out soon, and if they are getting $1.00 per sold equipment and 15% on commodities, and if you transfer to paypal its 15% on top of everything else. Makes me wonder if that was the main reason the Auction House was factored in.

Another big issue that is a no-no for me is always on DRM. That means you need to log into the game to play, and no offline mode to play by yourself. So if the server goes down for maintenance, too many people logging on at once, or even server lag is all a factor in the game you purchased. Also for something that requires you to be connected the whole time, you would thing matchmaking for public games would be better, but it's not. Most of the time you are put into a game with just one other person and there is no kick option for people who want to grief you. I'm surprised they couldn't have it send you into games with more people since they are able to code LFR and LFD in WoW, or they could just have a game list for people to join.

Now onto exploration, it was advertised to have randomized maps, but this is only partially true. The map itself stays the same every time and only events are randomized (Like a cellar door open on time leading to a dungeon, which could be closed the next map reset). This makes playing through the acts multiple times tedious after a while, especially if you want multiple hero's in Inferno.

Soundtrack:

The soundtrack is pretty cool and adds to the feel of epicness that you can slay tons of enemies to. The main theme is really epic and by far my favorite. You can tell they took their time with the soundtrack to make sure it was up to par with mainstream games. The soundtrack changes based on the theme of each act you visit.
The sound effects of the weapons and attacks are really polished. From the Monks Daibo spinning to the barbarians leap sound great and don't seem they are just stock attack sounds. The voice acting in this game is ok, not the best in the world, but it works. The jeweler acting though is pretty awesome and is the most memorable for me.

Graphics:

I think they did a really good job with the graphics. I like the look of each hero and their abilities, and with the different runes for the skills the looks change and most look diverse from one another. Each act has its own look, from the graveyard to the desert. They are really well designed visually and the first time through them is pretty awesome.

Verdict:

The game itself is pretty fun the first few times through (Cool story, great soundtrack and nice graphics), but it does get tedious after a while without a real randomization to the maps and not just events. Throw in the fact the game has to be connected all the time to the servers could lead to many annoying moments with server overload or lag, I recommend saving your 60 dollars until they iron out all these issues.

Also, I must complain about the lack of mid-mission saves. The missions can be 45 minutes long, and if you die at the end, you'll just have to try it all again. That's terrible in a portable game. Still, Capcom pretty much meant for you to play in a group or not at all.

3.0,False,"02 28, 2006",A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B0009N5O5E,Indy Reviewer,"Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO) is an above average dungeon crawler that has the potential to be a lot of fun for a while with enjoyable instanced quests and lively gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of little things that will likely make the value of the subscription fee here questionable in a month or two, and even early on many will have issues with forced grouping.  Having actually purchased the headstart, I am having a blast - but take a star off of fun for the grouping issue, and two stars off of overall for the rule implementations, lack of PvP, and value proposition, leaving this at 4 fun/3 overall, or 3.5 stars.

With Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) having spawned literally tens of thousands of imitations at the top of the family tree of RPGs, MUDs, and MMORPGS, publisher Turbine has both the blessing of an eager audience and curse of a really tough comparison.  The good news is that they've done an enjoyable job of implementing the heart of the D&D experience, which is the dungeon crawl.  Unlike many MMORPGs, support classes like rogues are a requirement for almost all dungeons - there's no uber single class build here - and a well designed group and careful gameplay is a more important than any particular player, item, or spell.

However, the group aspect is double-edged.  Outside of the first 5 or 6 early dungeons (even less for certain weak combat classes), solo play simply doesn't work - meaning your entire gaming experience will depend on finding a suitable group or guild.  The support for this isn't bad, with ingame voice chat and being able to select exactly what you want in terms of a class and level in group search, but even players within a good guild can have significant waiting times while everyone gets ready.  Turbine could and should have come up with a way for solo players to do something to advance.  All adventure is instanced, which in this implementation makes sense but does mean like Guild Wars the only 'massive multiplayer' aspect of the MMORPG feel is when you're at the taverns.

D&D purists will probably not like the rule implementations either.  Monks, druids, and several races are left out as are any number of skills, but the biggest wildcard is adding 4 class and race 'enhancements' which provide benefits far above even the best feats (like +5 to all skills or +3 in a certain statistic).  Given how the game is set up, it doesn't really affect balance much - can't solo anyway - but between that and loot drops that rival the taj mahal (down a bit from beta, but not much), it does annoyingly throw traditional character builds out the window.  Why bother making an especially stout fighter with high constitution if you're going to get 25 free hit points from the start?

More significant is longer term viability.  Advancement is quick enough so the current level cap (10) was actually reached by any number of people in the 10 day beta.  This will shortly be raised to 12 and eventually to 20, but the real issue is the lack of any alternative to the dungeon crawl - PvP, crafting, or anything else - that encourages people to stick around to pay the $14.95 monthly fee.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm having more fun playing this now than any game in a long time.  The issue is that I can also easily see not playing this in 30 or 60 days from now, which is a real shame.

I found the controls the worst part of the game, they are so non-intuitive that even now I hate them, I'm sorry but if I had known the controls would be like this I would not have bought the game - download the demo and try for yourself! The controls direct Indy in relation to the screen and not Indy, so if Indy is pointing left and you hit the forward arrow he doesn't go forward he instantly turns right and runs away from you, if he is pointing left and you push left, he doesn't turn left he moves towards the left of the screen (forward to him), actually its not directly left as he moves in a big circle while pointing left.
Apparently Indy has been to swimming class as well, for when he is underwater he moves at about 50 miles per hour. He can swim the whole length of levels and back bouncing off walls while underwater.
I feel really bad to bring up so many bad things about the game, its fun to be Indy but the controls and saves ruined it for me and the fighting got boring quickly. I doubt if I will finish it..sigh...",Just so-so,1054771200,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

- Legends of Rock has a nice selection of music. There is a good variety from classic rock to 90s alternative to current stuff. The total number of songs is pretty impressive too.

- Single player career mode is fun, and the difficulty was just right on Easy. I tried on Medium though and got whooped. You'll start off as a nobody and slowly work your way up to superstar status. The progression is fun, although not very original.

- Stage designs are fresh and unique, and look pretty damn good on the PS3.

- Fairly good selection of guitars and characters to choose from.

- Good audio quality, which is a must for this genre.

The Bad:
- Online play is spotty at best. I could typically connect to one match, but then I couldn't get connected to a 2nd match. This was a huge disappointment for me because online play was one of the reasons I bought this game.

- Limited customization of the characters. I know World Tour addresses this issue, but the characters only have a couple outfits. It'd be nice if you could custom design your rocker like on Tiger Woods games.

- No idea how to unlock characters. I beat the single player game on Easy mode and didn't unlock a single character. What gives! I assume you need to beat it on Medium or Hard to open them up. Either way, I was disappointed.

- Limited stats. Maybe its me, but they give you all those nice stats at the end of each song and then they're not stored anywhere. There is no way to see your best % of notes hit, longest note streak, etc. Take some notes from Grand Theft Auto, and gimme some stats!!

- Graphics are OK, but could be better.

For one, the Single Player was kinda meh. It has some twists and plots that were kinda known during some points of the cut-scenes and you could already predict what could happen next. The single player experience was more on the lines of Battlefield: Bad Company style. The acting/cast was decent and it even had some humor parts. At the end of the single player campaign, it leads you with a plot twist, which they will probably pick the story back up in Battlefield: Hardline 2. The campaign achievements are somewhat easy to get, you can get one for every mission/episode you complete (there are 10 episodes/missions). The best part about this game is that you can either run and gun throughout the game or you can stealth this whole game and arrest everyone you see (I tried to do this) and feel accomplished. The single player could have been longer and it could have even setup a better way to start Battlefield: Hardline 2 (if they are even making it in the future).

Multiplayer in this game like with other Battlefield games, the servers are stable More stable than other DICE/EA games to be completely honest. The game modes normally fit in within the whole Robber Vs. Cop theme, you have Blood Money, Heist, Bounty Hunter, Rescue, Crosshair, Hotwire and a few other Battlefield game modes. Basically the same game modes you see in other Battlefield games and a few new ones here and there. The maps are pretty large, destructible, and diverse ranging from the Everglades in Florida (w/ air boats) to the streets of downtown LA (w/ building to building action).

To me the game is worth the $22 dollars (w/ Premium), but it was not worth $60 for those who purchased it for that amount. You are basically buying a reskinned Battlefield 4 game, but with a Robber Vs. Cop theme which they could easily introduced it into Battlefield 4 as new DLC or a standalone game that works with Battlefield 4 in the background for about $30 or so dollars.",A different pace for the Battlefield series,1471219200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Even if you don't find a good one on sale I'd recommend spending $10-20 more to get something that will last. This mouse looks and feels good ergonomically, and if you're not used to a smooth tracking mouse you might not notice but for me the tracking of this mouse felt awful.

My reason for not replacing it sooner was because I thought the issue was with my laptop or WiFi. I hate to be so harsh but if this review saves some people $30 then it's worth being a bit negative.

I bought this mouse on Jan. 17, 2017 to use with my laptop, for work and gaming. It worked OK for general use but gaming with it felt for lack of a better term, bad. I pretty much avoided gaming on my laptop while I was using this mouse.

The Deathadder was bought way back on May 18, 2016 and still blows this mouse out of the water, the tracking is so much smoother... although it cost significantly more at ~$50. As of Dec. 7, 2017 the Deathadder is still going strong but the Naga Hex V2 is actually having issues where it randomly stops working. If I could go back I'd probably get a 2nd Deathadder instead even though I got the Naga on sale for ~$40. That said, the next mouse I try will probably be the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum.

The Bad: Having no guidance almost breaks the entire game, clicking around aimlessly can be frustrating, inconsistent character designs, hand drawn cut scenes are pretty bad, voice acting is spotty

Point and click adventures are still abundant, but good ones are hard to come by, and even rarer are ones that make it mainstream. Gray Matter is a game that has a story a bit more sophisticated than your typical adventure game. You play as both Samantha Everett and David Styles who are probably the most interesting characters of the game. Sam is an orphan who is traveling the world, but her bike breaks down in London and she winds up at Dread Hill which is the home of Dr. Styles. Dr. Styles is researching ways to bring his wife's spirit back after a fatal car accident and he'll do anything to get this research done. The rest of the characters are people you recruit for the research, but their personalities aren't as likable as the main characters.

The story really gets involved and has a twist ending that will surprise you so playing through the game is worth it. The game play consists of your typical clicking on things to find the clues and move on. However, Gray Matter is severely flawed in that you have missions to complete and each mission has a number of points associated with finding things. If you miss a few points you have to scour the huge world in the game to find what you missed. This can lead to hours of hunting and clicking on everything until you find it. Certain events won't trigger until missions are done which I really hate. There is also little to no direction on where to go and what to do in the game. There are different areas in the game you can jump to, but there are so many things to click on that the game is nearly impossible to beat without a guide. Later in the game you run into a labyrinthine maze type area and this will take forever without some kind of guide.

There are a few interesting things Gray Matter does for the adventure genre and these are magic tricks. You get a book of magic and you have to use it to get certain things done in the game. Things brings up a new window that has you following instructions on how to map out the trick. Its interesting and changes the pace a bit. Of course there is a mini-game tossed in here and there, but most of the time you will be running around clicking on everything almost blindly and this really hurts the flow and pacing of the game.

The visuals in the game are decent, but the drawn cut-scenes that are just a few frames really aren't that great. The art is smudgy, and the character design is inconsistent throughout the whole game. The in-game models will be completely different from the hand drawn scenes, but then some scenes will have the characters looking different. I found this very weird and annoying. Overall the art is very nice especially towards the end of the game in the Daedalus Club.

The voice acting is decent at best, but Sam's actress is pretty bad and sounds cheesy. Most of the game is all British actors so there isn't much variety. My favorite character of them all is Dr. Styles who is struggling within himself to go out and socialize, but he feels like a monster due to the scar on his face. The game is really an acquired taste among both adventure gamers and hardcore gamers alike.

If you can stomach the goalless wandering of the game by either using a guide or just aimlessly clicking everywhere you will be rewarded with a rich and dark story. The game also has a decent length that will run you about 8-10 hours and that's if you just use a guide and run through the game.

The main gripe I have with this game is almost nothing happens military wise between opposing AI players. 90% of the time they sit there and demand that you cancel trade deals with one another. But rarely start any kind of larger war with one another. Unless you happen to be nearby then it's break out the troops and stomp headlong into the motherland.

Let me share one of my recent epics through Civ IV. I was the Spanish, carefully minding my own business on an island I shared with the French. Throughout the entire game there were no wars, except for when Civ's captured the barbarian settlements and when the Aztec's decided to obliderate the Russians. (Because they are so aggressive the Aztec's are the only civ that will go to war with another AI civ. As a friend of mine once stated ""If the Aztec's could have a civil war they'd do that too.""

But other than that nothing else happened except at one point the Chineese, The Romans and The Americans all decided that my Civilization was a threat to international security and simultaniously decided to invade. That's it. No other wars took place (even though I turned on AI aggression) - I even checked the logs at the end of the game to make sure.

So other than not declairing wars the Civilizations main goal is to build the rocket ship to go to Alpha Centuri as fast as possible and failing that they'll try to build a superior culture.

The really only other thing I don't like about Civ IV is the new government system. While it is a neat concept to be blending in different concepts such as a communist state with free speech and universal sufferage most times it really doesn't feel like you have a government at all.

I was a big fan of the old government systems, mostly because being the poli sci dork that I am I liked creating my own back stories to the changes in governments and interactions between civilizations. (In the year 1600 the Myan revolutionaries successfully over through the Smoke Jaguar dynasty and established a democratic state. With the singing of the Constitution of the 1600 in....) You see the point. For me it just seems like Civ's are on thier own islands in the world not really doing anything except scientific research.

That aside though the game is beautifully polished and fireaxis games has cut down on a lot of the tedium of Civ III.  Most notably getting rid of some of the unfun things like riots and polution, and significantly speeding up the game play. A game of Civ III could take as long as 24 hours or more to complete from begining to end. While a game of Civ IV can be completed in less than three.

The multiplayer aspect of the game is probably it's best feature. If you play with a number of human opponents the game takes on a feel of what should have been evident when one plays with the computer.

Although I have not played the expansion pack my only hope is that the it address the AI nonagression problem. Otherwise despite the long game play I will most likely revert to playing long draw out games of Civ III to fulfil my global governing ways.",Civilization IV Culture wars or Space Race?

3.0,True,"02 16, 2004",A1AJWJGB89GSIL,B00004U8K3,R. Huffman,"I should announce before we start, that this is review of the single player (non-multiplayer) perspective part of Hidden & Dangerous 2.
I recieved this game for Christmas and was excited about it.
All the cool commercials had me intrigued. I loved the concept, with the whole historical British SAS perspective of the war. The British Empire stretching across the globe,  and the exotic locations and potentials seemed exciting!
My first impressions of the game were great.
The opening scenes were dramatic (but no more than others I've seen, but still impressive).
As cool as the little movies are between each mission, they are not needed for gameplay and slows down the overall game (therefore they should drop them).
On the technical side;
I have a 2.0Ghz computer, and  on the box is states ""2.0Ghz"" or more. However, it runs VERY SLOW!!!! I guess this game is going to force me to buy a new comp. or upgrade my existing comp. just to play it!!!!!
Once I was deep into the N. Africian campaign (and MANY missions into the single player game) and not only did the game automatically turn off my computer (which would happen every 4 hours of game play), but it erased all my saved games.
After getting over my furious-like-rage (and all the time lost), I had to regretably start over.
None of the first person games I've ever played, has this many technical problems!
Medal of Honor is the best 1st person WWII game in my oppinion.
Ease of use, non-memory-hog  and overall simplicity, make MOH a real  blast! (I've played it through, front-to-back many many times.)
That is why I will be comparing Medal of Honor and Hidden & Dangerous 2.
H&D2's main menu and interface is terrible!!  In MOH you go to ""saved games"" and view all the files you saved (sometimes 20 per mission, depending on how careful you are). In H&D2 you cannot do this, and it only states ""Resume"" (...the last time you saved your game.... in other words).
This needs MAJOR improvement.
Some have stated in the reviews, that ""H&D2 sucks because picking up items and handling anything, requires many sub-menus to toggle through"", which the previous reviewers hate. I totally agree, toggling through lots of inventory menus and such, is very difficult and bad design (all while your hearing bullets whistling by your ear!!)!
There are too many commands also. This makes the game too complicated as well. Trying to find the right command requires memorization. I even typed up a paper with all the commands to help me. This game needs serious simplification!
With all this said, I genuinely like the game. I love the British perspective too.
The sound effects are sharp and very realistic (you can actually hear the empty shell casings hitting the ground after you've fired your weapon).
The backgrounds are beautiful too. In many missions the evening skys are breathtaking and very realistic!!. In one mission, I travelled to a N. Africian oasis, and the buildings had great textures on the walls. Some of the buildings in the N. Africian campaign have mosiacs on the walls!
I love choosing your weapon and equipment before the missions. I love having to think about the possibility you could run out of ammunition during a mission (something that would never happen in MOH).
Overall, I really like this game. It's too bad I have to upgrade my computer just to play this game more fluid (and smoothly).
It's also too bad that H&D2 is so complex, making gameplay suffer.
I also believe that like a good portion of the computer gaming world, I do not play multiplayer ""online"" games (and don't have the required DSL or Cable internet lines to support it). Therefore a high percentage of gamers lose out from the multiplayer focus of the game makers (of H&D2). (Which is another reason why this game falls way short.)
I am hoping I'll be able to finish the game before I lose my passion for it (due to all it's short-comings).","Great Game, but very frustrating",1076889600,,,
3.0,True,"04 28, 2011",A3R1Y85ER0LCRC,B002BS47YE,Raymond Wilmott,"Overall this is a good game. Good graphics, cool story, fun to play. I didn't run into any bugs or crashes while playing it, which is always a good thing - too many pc games get rushed out full of bugs, and this one seemed pretty solid.

On the down side, I just didn't feel that this game was as good as the original Crysis, or even Crysis Warhead. As others have said, it just felt too linear. Yes, in the original, you were always being guided from point A to point B also....but it always felt like you could stray off the path a bit, or take a slightly different, less-direct way there.  In Crysis 2, it's a more confined, straight-forward path that you are forced down.

I also deducted one star on my overall rating because of the lack of graphics tweaks/settings, and the removal of cheat codes.  Most PC games allow you to adjust many different graphics settings, so that you can get the game to look the way you want, or work optimally with your PC. This game offers only 3 graphics settings....they should have allowed more freedom with the settings.  Also, I have heard that when the game was first released, you were able to access the ""developers console"" while playing the game, and type in cheat codes (for 'god mode', unlimited ammo, etc).  This was removed via later patches. One of the main reasons that I play PC games instead of the console versions is to be able to access cheats, which many PC games offer. The original Crysis did. This one should too. I can understand developers removing cheat access while playing multiplayer obviously, but cheats should always be available during single player games. I play a fair amount of PC games, and usually end up using cheats at some point to get past particularly difficult areas. Call me lame, but I paid my $50 for the game, and I want to be able to finish it!  (I did end up finding a 'trainer' program on the net to allow cheating in Crysis 2, but they should have just left the cheat access in the game itself).","Good, but a step down",1303948800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"02 11, 2012",A2Y47HN5IP85J,B004L4G8UC,M. Richardson,"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Shadow Wars is a fun shooter strategy game. Customization aspects are limited for your units, as you can't change classes or really do much of anything in terms of customization except deciding between similar pieces of equipment for your guys. Classes themselves differ mostly in terms of their equipment, although these allows enough variation to be satisfying. Most of the classes (sniper, medic, heavy weapons guy, etc.) are are fairly balanced, but there is at least one class (assassin) that is so overpowered that it takes away most of this title's difficulty.

 In fact, most of the difficulty in this title is artificially imposed by time limits and such, although when enemy units are gunning for your weakest team member, it can add to the challenge (one universal fail condition for any of these missions is if any of your guys die). I recommend only playing on hard mode, as normal mode poses no challenge whatsoever.

 The multiplayer for this game is awful. There isn't even any typical local play. No download play either. You have to pass THE SAME 3DS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PEOPLE when you want to play multi-player! This is so insulting that I wish they would have just integrated the so-called ""multi-player"" missions into the single-player campaign.

 The game's cut-scenes are atrocious when they try to show any kind of actual animation, which is why the game mercifully limits most of the cut-scenes to dialogue boxes between different characters.

 Story-wise, this is mostly uninvolving. It involves an attempted take-over of the Russian government by a cabal of ultra-nationalists who wish to unseat the current, more democratic administration in power by instigating trouble in neighboring countries. It's okay, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. The characters are flat and stereotypical, but this didn't bother me too much.

 With all of that out of the way, I'd like to note what the game does right: quite a bit, actually! The 3D effect is hit-and-miss at times, but it can add a lot of depth to the battlefield, so I usually play this with the 3D enabled. Atmospheric effects are actually pretty good, although they can kill the frame-rate at times. The single-player content is quite a bit of fun. The gameplay mechanics themselves are very tight. Gameplay style is actually unusually varied for this genre of game, which I was definitely happy to see. The main campaign is of a decent length, and then there are extra ""skirmish"" missions on the side that mix things up a bit. I had a lot of fun with the single-player side of things.

 Overall, I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this, but as an under-$30 title, this is a great value for strategy fans.","A fun, flawed budget title for the 3DS",1328918400,,,

I LOVED them in every way. Well, the 'wire' shorted out at the sound box, so it was time to buy something else. I decided to try the PS3 Sony Wireless Headset, for it was time to go wireless, and they were about the price the PX21's were when I bought them. I wasn't just slightly let down, I was disgusted.
First of all, 7.1 surround? Well if that is 7.1, i'll take my px21's sound over that ANY DAY... also it doesnt monitor your voice like the Turtle Beach models do, so i was shouting because I couldn't hear myself (noice cancelling) when I was playing with friends. That not only made me feel tired and strained, but I could see that making others around you become annoyed to hear you yelling, around you and online.
The worst part is how uncomfortable they are. They are bulky. I could only play like 2-3 hours and I just had to quit from the discomfort and even a headache from them. The discomfort is my number one complaint. Cloth from TB's are more comfortable as well, than the leather of these rubbing my ears raw.
As far as sound, the volume levels do not go up as high as TB's so distinguishing footsteps isn't as easy to surprise opponents. A also the adjustment for the voice verses game, is a slide bar, that i could NEVER seem to get a sweet spot on, either I couldn't make out what my team was saying, or I couldn't hear the enemy running around me...

3.0,False,"12 25, 2007",AQS0FWGVAQ51C,B000EP3ZLC,TigerNightmare,"I loved The Longest Journey.  The story was amazing and original and had a talented and charismatic lead actress, Sarah Hamilton, who injected April Ryan with warmth, depth, humor and charm.  And in April's long, long journey, she traveled the worlds and met many different people, becoming to most of them a symbolic representation of what everyone should strive to be: someone who rises above themselves to accept the challenge because it is the right thing to do.  Not only was the story enjoyably epic, it was a lot of fun figuring out what to do with all the things you pick up, as you would in other traditional adventure games like this.  One of the things that made The Longest Journey so accessible to so many is that, like in Grim Fandango, it was impossible to die, lose or make an irrevocable mistake, you only had to figure out what to do next.

With that said, I was anticipating Dreamfall with great excitement for a long time.  The simple prospect of April Ryan returning so we could experience the next chapter in her amazing life was all I needed to know.

Unfortunately, while I hate to use this term, I'm afraid the developers sold out.  To make the game more accessible to the masses (IE, uneducated button-mashing FPS junkies), they side-stepped the traditional adventure in favor of an adventure with the action element of combat.  The problem isn't merely the existence of combat, but that it was done poorly.  The control during combat is unresponsive and a bit unpredictable.  It's not terribly difficult to down an opponent, it's just annoying.  I know one button blocks, one button does one kind of attack, another button does another kind of attack, and if I hold down one of the buttons, I do a strong attack but leave myself vulnerable while I wait for it to execute.  What I do is basically a stick and move kind of strategy; I wait for them to move and then get out of the way so I can attack while they're throwing punches away from you like a jack ass.

A lot of people here have complained about the control and I really don't see what the problem is.  Of course, I have a gamepad.  Come on, people, they're not that expensive.

On the plus side, the environments and graphics are absolutely stunning.  You get a sense of true immersion in the beautifully rendered locations you explore with a fine attention to detail.  Unfortunately, the talking animations have the characters looking stiff.  Their lips, jaw and eyes move, but the character models lack a naturalistic touch that gets their whole body moving like a real person would.  Some minor characters can't even open their mouths while they talk, too.  They also don't have tongues and this combination of no tongues and awkward facial animations made for the weirdest looking on-screen kiss I've ever seen in a game--and I've seen two skeletons kiss for Pete's sake.

The voice acting is also very well done, but I get a sense that the humor and charm that were in the first game are very much absent.  Aside from the sexy accent, there really wasn't a lot of personality in the new main character, Zoe Castillo.  She had a nice, sweet scene near the very end of the game, but aside from that, I didn't fall in love with her like I did April Ryan.  As for April Ryan in this game, she's turned into a sour puss.  She's bitter and angsty and, while she still wants to do the right thing, she's just lost her charm completely.  I found Kian to be an interesting character, a religious crusading zealot who turns out to have so much more potential.  The saving grace in the humor department is, of course, Crow.  He is consistently funny and gave the story much-needed comic relief.  Like this line, for example: ""Stay brave!  We're not giving up until you're safely out of here!  Or, dead!""

The story is the real strength of the game, and fans of The Longest Journey are used to long exchanges of dialogue, simply because it is well-written, well-acted and very compelling.  The problem with Dreamfall is that there isn't much gameplay to accompany the story.  There's way too much sneaking around and doing the same exact puzzles with Zoe's mobile software.  I don't have a problem with sneaking or simple mini-games, it's just that there isn't anything else for you as a gamer to do.

Back to the story, though.  I had bought this game last year and put off playing it after a few chapters.  Once I started over and got back into the game, I couldn't get enough.  Despite the flaws of the game, the story was enough to keep me invested in playing.

In the beginning, after a short introduction, we see Zoe in a hospital room in a coma while her father sits in vigil and then we flashback to two weeks earlier and we start the game.  And at this point, while trying to reveal as little as possible, all of our heroes are against the ropes and it looks like the bad guys are going to win.  We finally reach full circle and see how Zoe ended up in a coma.  And then ... the credits roll.  My eyes widened and I said, ""What the hell?""

Cliffhangers.  Lots of them.  I don't normally dislike cliffhangers, but they just don't work in video games, especially when completion of the sequel is years away.  I felt like the third act, or perhaps the third, fourth and fifth act, were missing.  It felt like half a game.  Just when the three main characters are in the same place at the same time, before a satisfying conclusion can be reached, it ends.

What infuriates me is that the sequel will be released, eventually, in downloadable chapters over time and most likely they'll all be available in one box at retail stores after they're all out.  My Dreamfall installation takes up 5.73 GB of hard drive space, so you can see my reluctance with downloading files that will take days to complete.

Despite its flaws, the gameplay is forgivable and the story is enough for anyone who loves a good story, but I simply cannot recommend Dreamfall at this time, at least not until the sequel is out and fully realized.","My exact words were,",1198540800,,,

I picked this up (rented, thank goodness) to see how it was and if I could maybe learn some language while at work since I have a lot of downtime to wait. After playing it for about 30 minutes, I was done with it.

I don't think I'd have cared so much if it didn't force you to do the mini-games until you obtain a mastery score for a certain word. And certain mini-games didn't really force me to learn anything at all. For instance, the ""Word Find"" puzzle just made me remember that the days of the week end in ""-youbi"". Which, it's great to have learned anything--but it didn't help me learn what day is which.

I can see how someone might enjoy this game, and be able to learn a bit from it, since it does give pronunciations, but it also lacks the romanji all-together, it seems.

3.0,False,"10 30, 2013",A9PAC5VFTDQHF,B00C7103DO,Thomas Riccardi,"Throughout the years there have been many video games based off of comic book characters. However, none of these games have been so good as the Batman series. There were a few that were flawed but most gave the player an immersive experience and that was no truer than Arkham series. Starting off with Arkham Asylum you were put in the role of Bruce Wayne trying to stop the Joker. Arkham City was another excellent entry in the series giving you a huge environment to explore. Now the third game in the series called Batman: Arkham Origins has made its way onto consoles but is this a game you should experience?

Arkham Origins is a prequel taking place five years before the events unfold in Arkham Asylum. Set in a wintery Gotham the caped crusader has only been fighting crime for only two years. The police department has no idea whether or not it is a masked vigilante or some urban myth created by people on the street. On a very blustery Christmas eve Batman is being hunted down by eight killers who want to claim the bounty set on his head. The 50 million dollar bounty put in place by a figure only known as the Black Mask wants him dead. While taking care of the black mask's minions you will run into familiar faces such as the Joker and Penguin.

Gameplay is similar to the first two games as you can take your opponents on in one of two ways. You can use stealth to your advantage as you can glide , grapple and sneak around the map to take your targets out quickly and quietly. You can also go in using a variety of gadgets at your disposal such as the batarang, explosive gel and smoke pellets. When you need to travel to a new location you can call upon the batwing to give you a much needed lift instead of going there on foot.

Also included in this game for the first time is a multiplayer mode.  One of the modes is ""Invisible Predator Online"" in which you can choose from one of three sides. You can choose to play on the side of batman and robin or the gangs of Joker and Bane. The gangs get points by killing off each others reinforcements while batman and robin gain points by intimidating the gang members. Earn enough points and you can play either as Bane or the Joker.

With a rich storyline, great voice acting and multiplayer modes it's clear that if you loved the first two games you need to pick this one up.",Batman the early years,1383091200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"07 2, 2011",A1Z0K3LNNGE24M,B002M6VSOM,Amazon Customer,"When I first heard about this game, I think it was actually in danger of never being released due to publisher issues or budget, can't recall which. So I jumped on it when I later found out it had been released, and got a good deal on the collector's edition.

As the title says, I really wanted to like this game. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil & Silent Hill series, as well as other titles on the genre spectrum like Siren and Fatal Frame. Add to that the location setting of Tibetan mountains and Far East mythology, and it sounded like an awesome entry into my library. Alas, I was to be disappointed.

Some people have stated the game was slow, but I agree with others that say that for survival horror, it's pretty standard, so I didn't have a problem with that. I was even enjoying the story and main character, for as far as I got. What killed my enjoyment was the controls and laggy response in the combat system. Encounters with one or two monsters was manageable, but the controls were clunky enough that more enemies than that made it extremely difficult to keep going and eventually I got frustrated and stopped playing it.

The game mechanic of 'slashing' the enemies with the Wii-mote was intriguing, but the way the programmers implemented it, was far too twitchy to keep the game fun. I would vastly have preferred something like the glyph system in Castlevania: Dawn Of Sorrow. For those not familiar with it, different monsters were defeated by a particular glyph you drew with your stylus. Something like that would have been fairly easy with a Wii-mote. Instead the game had trouble registering basic movements with it, probably due to poor programming.

It really was a shame, because I was looking forward to this game. Perhaps some day I'll go back and try again, but I have a lot of other things to play first so it doesn't look very likely. I'm sure plenty of 'hard core' gamers out there will think I'm just a wuss with poor skills, but I literally own about 800 games across a dozen consoles and the PC. I'm not a top-tier 'twitch' gamer, but I think my skills are pretty good most of the time.

3.0,True,"05 21, 2008",A14NA0W8ESGDSI,B000QW9D14,T.L.,"One of the first things you'll notice as you begin to play Blue Dragon is that the game's story revolves around a simple good versus evil dichotomy with little variation in character outlook from that. The good characters are sickly good and the evil characters are deviously evil --- there are no characters with real depth. It's for this reason I find it hard to see in any of the characters human characteristics or relate to any of them.

The models as well are childish in nature and make the characters (which the manual states are in their late teens) look like they're all under the age of 10.

The plot from the very beginning is also easy to read and lacks any sort of depth or any form of twist to keep the player engaged. It's like reading a story after reading a summary of the plot --- you just don't find yourself surprised when something happens because you knew it was going to happen. If an RPG doesn't shake your worldview in the slightest I consider it a complete failure.

As for the great mechanics I mentioned in my title --- I found the game design to be wonderful despite it's flaws with an actual story. The usage of the charge bar keeps the user engaged and I found the enemies to level up progressively at a reasonable pace similar to your own growth so it kept things somewhat enjoyable. The idea behind making random encounters random but allowing the user to attack them was also very cool (Secret of Mana style meets Final Fantasy < 12 JRPG battle system sort of thing).

The real problem with the mechanics, however wonderful, is that it's very very very easy to get higher levels simply because the enemies tend to be plentiful but easy to kill in one or two rounds from the start on once you've gained any sort of advantage. Your fighters will have mow down techniques which hit the whole first row for nearly the life of the enemy which could easily allow you to rack up experience points if that was your intention.

Quickly want to mention the shadow system. It allows users to attach a different class to their shadow to gain skills which can be set to other shadow classes they use. To put it simply I level up my black magic class and get the ability to use black magic level 1 spells on my fighter class by assigning it the skill I learned. The classes all have their own stats so it does have variations in terms of attack power in or out of the class but as others have mentioned can also allow you to create 5 distinct clones of each character with little trouble. I didn't, however, and found the system to be fun so it's really whether or not you take advantage of the system which will affect you in that regards. It could have been made better though, I agree, and more class selections would have given a more unique feel to the process as well.

Music was wonderful though and the graphics were pretty despite its cartoon feel. In general it's a good game and had the story been even somewhat decent would have been an unforgettable JRPG.",Great Mechanics with Horrid Story,1211328000,4,,

I do have some complaints on realism though - a lot of this is in comparison to the old ""Close Combat"" series I enjoyed a few years back.  The AI for units in COH is not that good.  If you order them to approach a building or fuel dump or whatever, they will go right up to it, even if there are enemies there!  They should stop and find cover.  Also, the fact that they can walk right up to Germans (even ones with machine guns) over open fields is strange.  Try that in close combat (and I expect real life) and you will never make it.  Also, even at very close ranges, it takes a Sherman several shots to knock out and armoured car, and a Sherman and Panzer IV can hit each other several times even in the side and rear before one blows up.  All the fighting takes place at short range - even if you try to hit something from a ways off the unit will move closer (often way too close) before firing.

The whole ""resources"" orientation (ammo, fuel, manpower) is not that distracting, but there are some pretty unrealistic capabilities like being able to repair a badly damaged tank in a few minutes.

3.0,True,"11 25, 2013",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B00EN1IF7C,Trenton Bennett,"When I first started playing Forza Motorsport 5, it was a magical time typical of most modern racers:  new challenges, great graphics, fun cars, and the Top Gear hosts' voiceover work (and tracks) made the game a joy to experience.  As racing games go, it's still got great graphics and fun things to do, many of which I outline here...but then some bad decisions in the game's design started to catch up to me.  For instance, menus really require me to be patient enough to move in and out of places to get what I need, like when I'm playing a series of races and can't quit until I finish loading the next race and listen to the voiceover.

But the big thing that's started to spoil the fun has been the way I run into dead-ends that want me to pay my way out of them.  It's one thing to offer DLC for a price, but quite another to invite me to an event that I then find out I can only participate in if I buy the DLC that gives me the one car I need for the event...which I then need to purchase using my in-game money.  Gift me a nice car that I can't use, and I'm now likely to think this is preparatory to releasing a ""buy me"" track pack.  It's nice to be able to choose whether to spend game-money or tokens to buy things, but I'm starting to notice how tokens are the FM team's way of getting me to plunk down money to buy more tokens.  I'm also not happy with the fact that neither my Logitech Driving Force GT nor my G27 (nor any other wheel made prior to FM5's release) is supported:  you are expected to buy into the newer, more expensive generation of racing wheel hardware.

For those of you new to this series, the Forza Motorsport games are a racing simulation that let you try and buy all sorts of cars, race them in many different types of competition, and as you earn money and experience, you get to then pour that into upgrades and modifications.  The graphics are just as beautiful as the commercials show you (and if you've been anywhere near a TV in the last month I'm sure you've seen them) and the variety of content and gameplay seems to suit every style.

What makes Forza Motorsport 5 so spectacular is the level of control you can have over your game.  If you are deep into simulation, you can tweak every single detail about your car down to the tire pressure--and you'll feel the difference.  You can upgrade just about every part, and you can even do so simply if you'd rather:  choose a Racing Class and Forza can automatically apply exactly the upgrades that are legal for that class.  Switch upgrades back and forth:  once you buy one, it's yours to add or remove.  Playing wins you both money and Tokens, and you can choose which to spend when purchasing a car or an upgrade...however, tokens will also let you buy your way into higher levels of gameplay if you really don't want to slog through every classification tier.

If you're more of an arcade-style racer, Forza will explain every step of the way as you build a career.  Make a mistake and you can rewind the gameplay, rolling it back and trying to avoid the accident this time around.  There are Driver Assists aplenty, and they can be tweaked.  For example, I don't like having Steering Assist or Braking Assist, but I do like having ABS.  Some people turn off Traction Control and drift more than I do.  You can decide if your tires, fuel, and damage should affect the race or if you'd rather be safe and just run the track without those worries.  When I turned it on, I would get detailed messages about which part(s) were damaged in a collision or when I ran off-road, and the suspension and steering would start misbehaving.

That's not all though:  Forza Motorsport 5 has an online aspect that's also as much or as little as you want.  As you drive, the game learns your habits and driving patterns.  It generates a ""Drivatar"" that's a virtualized version of yourself.  When you're offline, your Drivatar will go out and run races for you, earning a bit of money here and there and keeping its own leaderboard scores against other drivatars.  When you race, the game isn't injecting AI-driven drivers:  it's generating your opponents from other drivers' Drivatars.  It appears to do a good job matching them to your level, and as I got better some of my opponents dropped out and new ones that were less squirrely on the curves started running against me.

It's inevitable that you should be able to race against other opponents online...but there's also a way to compete up the leaderboards on the side, too.  As you play, you'll be offered a chance to challenge other racers' records:  play the track solo, racing to beat their time, and you'll see a ghost-car version of the player running the course with you.  It's loads of fun, and I found myself beating their record, then seeing how much better I could get with a few more laps.

Each racing type has many tracks to choose from, including more than one variation of the Top Gear test track.  If you're a fan of the BBC series, the three hosts of that show narrate parts of the game all over the place.  It was fun listening to Richard Hammond talk about how Rally Cars boil down to STIs and EVOs...but both owe a debt to the Ford Escort RS.

Still not enough?  Well, there's design.  Paint, decal, and stripe your car any way you want to.  Pick factory colors, make your own, save your designs and upload them for others to share.  I bought a 2005 Subaru WRX STI and for free I could pick a mirror-finish pattern someone made with Top Gear logos.

Despite loving the gameplay, I have to admit that there are some drawbacks to Forza Motorsport 5.  First, any racing game is really best experienced with a wheel, and so the gamepad is only so good.  The XBox One Controller puts force-feedback into the triggers and it helps, but using a wheel makes a huge difference.  Next...if you have a wheel, it's not going to work.  Yes, this is my biggest complaint.  With XBox One, the developers made a conscious decision to only support the next generation of racing wheels.  What I'm seeing of what's to come is amazing technology and part of me can't blame them, but I still feel bitten that my Logitech G27 doesn't at least minimally work.  I would love to see an update that would grandfather this bit in.  I also don't care for the slow plod towards trying to get me to pay more to keep playing.  I've bought plenty of downloadable content in my day, but typically it's more to enhnace a game I'm playing instead of to unlock something I probably should have had available in the base game.","Great, but Only To A Point",1385337600,5,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519zmWMnbkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41YYTR-P8LL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51igs1gzvNL._SY88.jpg']"

3.0,False,"05 11, 2012",AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B006D3JT0U,Brittany Rose,"The fact this game has been out for only two months and is already discounted to stuff-pack level basis should give you a pretty good indicator about how well it's (not) being received by the Sims community. The primary problem? It's severely lacking in originality. It both borrows from TS1's Superstar and elements of TS3's Late Night & Ambitions, without really offering anything new. While in theory many people have been clamoring for the return of celeb careers, Late Night really introduced a lot of the elements that Showtime builds on.

The gist, really the CORE, of the game comes from the three new professions that were added - Magician, Singer, and Acrobat. Much like the Ambitions professions, you can follow your Sim 'to work' where they perform at various venues, or if they're just starting out, on the street. When not actively performing gigs (impromptu or scheduled), they can also work on various skills and increase their celebrity level to push their career forward. You do control how they perform at each gig by selecting the sequence of songs / tricks / moves, and there's a small element of responding to the relatively easy-to-please audience's whims, but that's about it. With every level, your sims' performance skills improve. Magicians learn new tricks, singers have new songs & moves, and acrobats have new elements to perform. In addition, you'll unlock new costumes (which can be customized with the new 'Career' Create-A-Sim option) and be less prone to screwing up, and more likely to book bigger and better venues. It's pretty easy to move up the career chain, particularly if you anticipate the skills your sim needs to develop prior to hitting adulthood (ex: working out as a teenager paves the way for a great acrobat career as an adult). And since you're a celeb, you'll also be treated to pretty hefty payouts, with single gigs at big venues netting over $10,000 for just three sim hours of time.

Admittedly the game has come a long way from TS1's Superstar, whose random mini-games were enough to drive you mad. But the gameplay here isn't much different than Ambitions (read: it's repetitive), and you get half the amount of careers to play around with. The only long-term novelty is to try it out with sims of each gender to see slight nuances / differences, but even then that's only six goes through each job.

In addition, the game sort of buggers up what Late Night does, rather than smoothly interacts with it. Suddenly you've got clubs AND venues (the latter of which are nearly impossible to self-create), and no real harmony between them. The sheer number of venues you need in a town are staggering at this point, unless you want to perform at the same handful over & over & over again - the exception being Starlight Shores, your new town, which is jam-packed with venues, but lacking in 'true' nightlife clubs unless you add some new places or update the existing venues with Late Night items. Really, seeing as how Late Night introduced the concept of Celebrity, this game should have been rolled into that one (just like Generations should've been looped in with Pets) if you really wanted to give people a tangible, major addition to their game. Because really? There isn't anything else to comment on.

The decor / clothing is predictably 'lifestyles of the rich & famous' oriented, although a little wackier / more ostentatious than what was rolled out in Late Night. There aren't really many new interactions other than ones related to the new professions. There ARE a lot of classic TS1 / TS2 items that have made a thankful reappearance, including stuff like the gyro-ride, mechanical bull, karaoke machines, and pool tables...all of which really had a place as far back as Late Night. Maybe you *like* the idea of going back and updating all of your Late Night clubs to become venues or updating your Showtime venues to be like nightclubs (there's certainly room) but it's all just a lot of work for the average player I think. There's also the new Simport feature, which has been buggy ahoy and something I've actively avoided, where you can send your sim to another player's town for a 'tour', and if you're thinking this review isn't complete because I didn't include it, *Shrug*. It was never a feature I was craving.

Altogether I'm disappointed with Showtime, as I have been with the last 2 expansions. But to be fair, I wasn't expecting much from the last 2 expansions either. If you're a diehard fan, you'll pick this up anyway. My advice is to wait it out though.

The parkour element is done really well and fighting was really exciting.  As you play the game you will get experience points and new abilities so you're constantly getting new abilities and the game is slightly changing as you play so it doesn't get too repetitive.

Yet the game still felt too repetitive. After playing it for nearly 10 hours, I was bored with the game. The fighting became kinda boring even though I had new powers, it was the same type of thing, just over, and over again.  This might have to do with the fact that the storyline is pretty much non existent and is told in a somewhat original yet confusing way. This isn't much of a spoiler, but you basically consume people and see their memories. So the story is told in pieces and bits of memories. The problem is, is that none of the memories are really in sequence.  And all these bits and pieces come in 15 second chunks which basically never draws you in.

The game was a lot of fun. I don't deny that at all, but at the end of it I was left not really wanting to play it anymore, and not very satisfied.

Oh and if you're looking for a game that'll give you easy achievement points, this isn't one of them.

After all, I am a huge SW fan.  I even liked the game a lot after I had gotten it and had played through the first couple levels.  The problem is, as you progress further in the game, you realize ""I'm not having any fun.""  A lot of the levels make it totally unclear where to go, so much so that you'll find yourself wasting 1/2 hour just wandering around through areas where you've already been and wondering how to move on.  And the lack of camera control is fine in the early levels, but once you've gotten the jetpack and you have to do a lot of jumping around from platform to platform, it really gets annoying when you can't see where to go next because the camera won't move while you're hanging from a ledge.  My final criticism is that the actual bounty hunting seems cool at first, but winds up just being an annoyance.  When you get your first 5-10 bounties, you think it's a great new idea that makes the game interesting.  But then you go on, and you'll be in a situation where you have 20 guys shooting at you, and you can't take the time to scan for bounties without getting killed, and you can't control Jango's targeting efficiently enough to only shoot the guys who aren't bounties. And you start thinking, ""how is the bounty hunting really adding anything to the game?""  And you start wanting to just ignore that aspect of the game entirely and just treat it like a normal FPS.  But then, if the central theme of the game (i.e. bounty hunting) seems pointless, that's a sign of a big flaw in the game design.
Now I'll talk about things I liked...
The FMVs, voice acting, sound effects, music, graphics

Nothing is more frustrating than using a joy stick to go from letter to letter trying to type a message..it takes forever.

There is so much wrong with it, so many aspects of the gameplay that are either good ideas handled clumsily or just plain bad ideas... yet despite all that, it's still pretty darn fun to pick up and play. It looks great, and it has an interesting story, endearing characters, and a nice brisk pace. The basic gameplay is solid and entertaining, yet it just can't seem to stop tripping over itself with poorly implemented gimmicks.

Among what I would consider the major problems are:

- Opening the menu does not pause the action. I can appreciate the touch of realism they were trying to add, but in practice, all this does is make item use, or any other menu-based function, completely untenable during a battle.

- The Connect system. Again, it sounds cool in theory, but in practice it's just too awkward and time-consuming to be practical during a pitched battle.

- The maps are massive and confusing to navigate. It's easy to get turned around and start travelling the wrong way, and the mini map is not much help. In addition, it's sometimes not clear where you're supposed to be going next-- a character might tell you what town you're headed for, but there's no overworld map and no way to know where the town actually is in relation to your current location.

- Sparse save points! It can get really annoying when you've been playing for 45 minutes without spotting anyplace to save. And there's absolutely no excuse for not putting a save point before a boss battle at the end of a long dungeon.

- Too many junk characters in the party. With almost 20 main characters, there just isn't time to develop all of them. The core group of Capell, Aya, Edward, and Sigmund are well sketched and even memorable, but aside from them and a couple of others, the rest fall by the wayside. There's just no reason to have to manage nobodies like Kiriya and Kristopher, especially in a game that might well take you only 18-20 hours to beat.

The most frustrating thing about the game is that it puts it worst foot forward right off the bat. The first couple hours of the game are stuffed with questionable ideas, including a ""stealth"" section where the already tough navigation is hindered by darkness and a disabled mini map, and several unintuitive mandatory Connect sequences. The thing is, once the game gets going, it starts dropping the gimmicks and focusing on the core gameplay, and becomes infinitely more fun. It's such a cliche to defend JRPGs that start slowly, but this is one instance where the game really does get a lot better after the intro. After such a poor first impression, though, it would be hard to blame someone who just put the game down rather than giving it another chance.

With a little bit of tuning and editing, this could have been a classic game. Instead, it's a deeply flawed game that still contains a lot of opportunities for fun. The question is whether it's worth your time to go digging for it. Personally, I would still recommend the game to JRPG fans, but you should know what you're getting into.","Fun, worthwhile game despite major design flaws",1251849600,9,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

You can feel the love of the developers have for ""metal culture,"" and that love remains apparent throughout.  The story was actually pretty good, and it hints at something running much deeper, although I doubt we will see a sequel in the next decade, if ever.  Even before I had gotten far into the story (2 or 3 missions) I was already questioning the decision to make Brutal Legend an open world game.  It was fun to drive around for a while, but the thrill of running over creatures and finding ""artifacts"" to unlock songs, stat increases, etc. wears off quickly.  Very quickly.  All of the ""side quest"" type activities are repetitive brawls, turret defense, hunting missions, and races.  These are largely mindless and leave you unsatisfied.

The game really loses steam and never recovers when you're introduced to your first stage battle.  These stage battles are boring, simple, and repetitive (there's that word again...).  I played on Brutal difficulty, and I only ""lost"" one, which I then restarted and won in about ten minutes.  I don't even see how hardcore RTS fans could enjoy these.  Every one is almost identical in terms of strategy and tactics, even when you're facing different ""factions.""  After sitting through a couple of these stage battles I would audibly groan when the scaffolding would start shooting up and the stage lights would come on.  I didn't bother trying the multiplayer (a rarity for me) as I had no desire to do stage battles online.

If you grew up watching Headbanger's Ball or are otherwise in love with metal, you should check the game out simply because it will really bring back some good memories.  For everybody else, Brutal Legend is cheap enough that you won't be taking a great risk trying it for yourself.  Just expect to be left wanting in the end.",What a Shame...,1343001600,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Dead Space: Extraction is a quality on-rails light-gun shooter, which is exactly what the Wii needed.  Sarcasm aside, it isn't revolutionary or cutting edge, but it succeeds at everything it attempts to accomplish.  Basically, it's the same exact thing we've seen in Resident Evil: Chronicles and House of the Dead.  What the game does, it does well, and if you're into this sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy the heck out of it.  If you don't like on-rails shooters, you probably won't enjoy the game.  I would have rated this game higher, but it really feels like watching smartest kid in the class just scrape by with the bare minimum amount of effort.  It is definitely good, but the game and license have so much more potential than we see here.

PROS:
+++ Great graphics.  This game definitely pushes the Wii's graphical capabilities.
+++ Great sound.  Very moody.
+++ Decent story that fills you in on what happened before the original Dead Space game.
+++ Precise shooting controls.

CONS:
--- The first-person camera is way too jumpy at times and can be frustrating.  I managed to get motion sickness a few times as well.
--- Compared to the first Dead Space game, this is a much shallower offering.

GAMEPLAY: As stated previously, this is a light-gun shooter.  The game presents itself in a first-person perspective and handles all movement for you.  You use the pointer, pull the trigger and stuff dies.  The game takes great pride in the dismemberment mechanic, encouraging players to shoot legs and arms of enemies off with wild abandon since head shots and body shots are of little use against most enemies in the game.  The game offers a wide assortment of weapons with different firing modes, which gives quite a bit of variety.  Every weapon can be upgraded by grabbing upgrade powerups as your progress through the levels.  What's really great about the game is the drop-in/drop-out two-player co-op mode.  Whenever you have to kill zomb... er... necromorphs, it's always more fun to do it with a friend.

GRAPHICS: Amazingly good, for a Wii game.  No where near as slick as the XBox 360 game, but this game is a stand-out title on the Wii.  Unfortunately you will spend a lot of time being led about in the dark and the color palette is a bit dreary in an effort to give the impression of an oppressive horror scene, but it all looks very good.

VALUE: The main game is pretty short, but like many other light-gun shooters, the levels offer branching paths that encourage you to replay the levels to see parts that you have missed.  Additionally, there are some entertaining challenge modes that add several hours of time to the game.  Not a bad package as a whole.  The two-player co-op mode definitely adds to the value of this title.

STORY AND PRESENTATION: Mostly good.  The story is entertaining enough, although it is a bit campy and predictable.  Seriously, the game opens up with two characters planning their date for the evening, and I knew immediately who was going to die.  Rule #37 for surviving a zomb... err... necromorph invasion: don't make any evening plans with a member of the opposite sex.  Predictability aside, the story is decent and well-presented with some dark humor sprinkled about.  If I have any serious complaints though it is that I don't know of any way to skip the cut-scenes, which get a bit long-winded at times.  You'll probably find yourself thinking it would be nice if the characters would quit yakking and get back to letting you shoot stuff.

COMPARISONS TO DEAD SPACE: I thoroughly enjoyed the first Dead Space game on the 360, despite its many flaws.  The choice of making Extraction an on-rails shooter is decent enough, especially considering the first game was very linear as well, but I would have preferred having gameplay more akin to the original.  The story is presented better and the characters have a bit more depth, especially compared to Isaac, the main character from the first game who may as well been a murderous puppet in a space suit.  I would have much rather preferred the upgrade system from the first game, because the weapon upgrade system in Extraction just feels shallow and lame in comparison.  Extraction is a decent addition to Dead Space brand, but I can't help but feel that a lot of short-cuts were taken when designing the game.

Overall, I recommend this game to fans of the on-rails shooter genre since this is one of the best on-rails shooters produced yet.  If you liked Resident Evil Chronicles or House of the Dead, you will probably enjoy this game.  Even if you don't like on-rails shooters, fans of the original Dead Space should at least consider renting this game.  If you aren't a fan of either of those things, I can pretty much guarantee that you wouldn't like this game.  It's good for what it is, but it isn't really for everyone, especially if you are looking for a something with deep gameplay.

[EDIT: Some readers have asked me to go back and re-evaluate my criticism of the ""jumpy camera"" because there is a camera stability option that can be set.  I neglected to mention in my original posting that I had set the camera shakiness to 0 for my play through, so my original assessment still stands.  Thank you for those of you who questioned me on this point and asked me to clarify.]",Yet another quality on-rails shooter for the Wii,1254268800,14,,

3.0,False,"01 23, 2013",A2SSBTV5US30QL,B000QB058U,James Hunt,"Character creation:  Select male or female. About a dozen faces and hairstyles for each.  Facial hair options for male, piercings and earrings for females.  Select skin color and hair color.  Create name (shows up in written dialog with other characters).  Can adjust height and bulk.  Select Class - 2 each for 3 different factions.  One uses swords, another is sort of a magic user, and the third uses
sci-fi type weapons.  (the first 2 factions also have selected firearms that can be used so they aren't as distinct as they could have been)

World - Not open world but not strictly linear either.  As you play the game you open up new areas.  There are dozens of them but almost all fall into just a few types:  underground (with corridors and rooms), streets, dry river beds, and large indoor museum type buildings.  There are often several branching paths to take but it doesn't take much time to explore them.  After awhile they become very repetitive.  Stations are sort of ""safe houses"".  They have a healer, merchant, and quest givers.  There are a few vocalized expressions but almost all of the dialog must be read.

Enemies - A large number of different types; zombies, demons, etc.  Some physically attack you while others use ranged weapons or powers.  Movement varies widely, some jump, other walk, some can burrow underground, several fly or float in the air.

Inventory - A figure representing your character is used to equip armor and 3 weapons or weapon sets.  A grid is used to hold other items and loot.  Armor and weapons can be modified and upgraded.  Unwanted items can be broken down into components which take less room in your inventory.  Loot is not at all logical.  Any sort of creature, when killed, can yield money, armor, weapons, etc.  All over the environment are crates and boxes.  About 40% of them, when broken open, yield some sort of loot.

Economics - Not logical but it works.  You never have more money than you can use.

Combat - Generally works good although it is more arcade-like than a typical rpg.  Every little distance you travel you encounter another horde of enemies.  There is no stealth function.  There is a huge variety of firearms - pistols, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, etc.  The visual and sound effects are very good.  It is fun to try the new weapons you obtain just to see and hear the effects.

Quests - Must accept to open up new areas.  A main quest line plus many, many optional quests.  Almost all fall into 2 types:  kill x number of a certain creature or kill a specific ""big boss"".

Stability - Very good.  It would freeze occasionally.  Note I installed the patch.
The save system was unique in my experience.  There is no manual save.  It automatically saves your progress as you go.  Just quit the game at any point.  When you start playing again, your character, equipment, quest progress is all there.  The only thing not saved is your location.  It always starts with you in the last station you visited.

Overall thoughts - (from the perspective of a role playing fan)  What the developers did is very well done.  The problem for me was not enough variety.  For the most part you just go to an area and kill everything you encounter.  There is no real feeling of exploration.  After awhile it feels more like work than fun.  It is addictive though and I played it for many, many hours before moving on.  It is worth a look if you can get a used game at a reasonable price (under $10.00).","Role playing/action, 3rd or 1st person perspective",1358899200,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

That is minus one star.

They throttle itself functions fine. I actually prefer the more simple design and slide motion. Less things to go wrong or break.
The hat switches are comfortably placed and easy to reach with your thumb. The three buttons on the front are placed nicely for my hand. I can use my pinky, ring, and middle finger for them and have my index finger on the hat on the front of the throttle. The amount of buttons/switches available on the throttle is fantastic.

There is no center or 50% dent. I added my own by opening the throttle and locating the half-way point and carving in a dent for the slider's ""feet"" to bump down into. I did this after trying the velcro mod others have used, which I found to be next to useless and felt awful. There are no stars off for that since the center dent is subjective. Some like it some hate it. I personally like it to have control of my reverse thrust power in space sims. I do not mind a simple mod to add one in.

The second star off is the CH Throttle input itself. In their own software it shows the limitations of the 8bit system being used with a constant ""jitter"" of the throttle axis, which is sent directly to the games. Since it happens all along the range of the throttle, there is no way to really get around. If they would update their design and parts to leave the 1980s but keep the simple functions and general configuration of the devices, these things would be a five star rave review.

I no longer use this throttle, but keep it on hand in case I ever need a throttle on short notice. If CH updates their components to 16-bit I would definitely buy the updated version. As it is now with the 8-bit system in place and its limitations and the issues that introduces into current video games with a constant jitter on the axis, I cannot recommend the product to others.

3.0,False,"11 25, 2006",A1XGRRDCOZ83OK,B000F1UK3Q,M. Holland,"First off, I'm pretty confident in saying that Superman Returns: The Videogame is the best Superman game to date. Now gamers will quickly tell you that's a big feat in it's own, but that doesn't make it a good game by regular standards. From the get go Superman Returns has two things working against it, the fact that it's a Superman game and the fact that it's a movie tie-in game. Usually either one of those is enough to ruin a game right off the bat.

As a Superman game I would have to say that for the most part this game has succeeded. You do in fact feel like the Man of Steel overall while playing. As most know by now one of the most entertaining aspects of the game is flying, which I believe is done quite well. They seem to have really nailed most of the signature Superman flying poses that mirror what you've seen in the Superman movies. Powers in the game are handled quite well in my opinion also, you can quickly access three of the classic powers and they all have their varying degrees of usefulness. As far as the strength is concerned I think there really is the sense that you are, at least on some level, pretty close to Superman's power. You can pick up anything from cars to tankers or even fishing boats that can be used several ways in combat; anything from simply throwing them at your enemies to batting at them or hurled like a javelin.

As a game however, and an ""open ended"" game at that, I'd have to say I really wasn't all that impressed with Superman Returns.  The missions you'll find yourself in follow a very simple formula. Once in range of a mission you generally have the same objective (save for fire missions, boss fights, or a handful of unique scripted missions) you'll have to dispatch a number of bad guys who are attempting to destroy the city. You'll pretty much have about  five or six different types of enemies that you'll fight throughout Superman Returns, ranging from robots to cloned flying dragon esque creatures. The numbers will vary generally depending on your progress through the game, although the highest number you'll fight at any given time is usually around 15, save for your fight with Riot ( a villain that is able to duplicate himself). You'll quickly get tired of missions as they all pretty much start to seem the same, the game will simply mix up the types of enemies you'll fight, i.e. sometimes just robots, sometimes robots and clones, sometimes flying robots and clones, etc. So although the travel may be open ended I feel that by no means are the missions. Aside from a few mini-games (playable Bizzaro, high speed races, and finding 100 kittens) the game is pretty linear and doesn't give you much else to do.

The story of Superman Returns: The Videogame has little to do with the movie. Which from my experience with movie tie-in games they usually turn out to flop for generally the same reasons. The main reason being that it's difficult to make a 6-10hr game where you take control out of a in this case 2hr + movie. More often than not you'll find the tie-in game trying to drag out parts of the movie, that may have not been entertaining in the first place, so to counter this they take liberties with the story to basically fill in the game. So where an actor in a movie may have opened a door, in the game you may have to kill 20 guards, steal a nuclear sub, and hijack a helicopter to open the door...it will definitely fill that level. This isn't always a bad thing if done right, but more often than not it just feels like the whole game is being thinly drawn along to the next cutscene. Superman Returns seems more like a game set in the Superman universe in general, that happens to have a couple of cutscenes from the movie. Which you honestly can't bash them too much for adding in all of this extra content because Superman Returns the movie didn't have that much action. Much like many first movies in a series (X-Men, Lord of the Rings, etc.) it's meant to establish or in this case reestablish the characters.

From a technical stand point I may not be the best to listen to for a review of this angle of the game. I recently purchased a 360 (just for this game, that's how big of a Superman fan I am) so I haven't had much experience with what the system is capable of. Although from the other games I've played what I've seen from the system so far Superman Returns does seem to be graphically sub par. Now I'm no game designer so there may be tie to the amount of what the system has to render at any given time, keep in mind the Metropolis in the game is around 80 square miles and has over 9,000 buildings in it. So although I was pleased over all with the graphics, it doesn't seem to be up to the full or maybe even near full potential of what the 360 is capable of.

The game's audio seems to be pretty solid, nothing really stands out from a standard beat 'em up type game. The flying audio bits are great, the subtly of the cape flapping while flying around and the sound of the wind rushing past and eventually a sonic boom while speeding about are very satisfying. I have mixed feelings on the score however. My biggest issue is that the game doesn't draw from the Superman soundtrack, neither that of the new work done by John Ottoman...or the original work done by John Williams. This was really disappointing, Superman has such a march to it that seems to be ingrained with the character that's it's hard to think of Superman and not hum the Williams fanfare. I guess for non-Superman fans this could be related to playing a Star Wars game and not having the Williams theme included. Now in the defense the original score done for the game isn't bad, although at times it can seem somewhat generic. One of the nice touches that really helps the feel of the game is the change of pace of the music while flying. While flying lower near the streets and weaving through skyscrapers the games plays a pretty peppy fanfare esque tune, as you move higher past the rustle of the city into the skies above the music calms and shifts to a much slower melody.

Now although I'm trying to be objective as possible I can't say that I didn't like the game. I myself am a Superman fan, and a big one at that...there are still pictures from Christmas day of me in my Superman outfit standing proudly. So for me any opportunity to take the wheel of the Man of Steel (excuse the rhyme) is something I enjoy, and so far this is the most entertaining opportunity that gaming has presented. To be honest if all you could do in this game was fly around the city I would have still bought and not felt cheated. Obviously there are many that aren't able to take this much joy from certain aspects of the game so if you're looking for an XBox game that allows free open ended game play, challenging and engaging enemy fights, and a great story...save your money.

The game simply doesn't have the depth of previous installments. The battles are simpler and can even be automated, while the plot progression and navigation follow along a strictly linear path. There is no exploration to be had or curiosity to be satisfied. This design approach leaves me at a loss, because the potential was clearly there to build massive, immersive 3D worlds. If the company can demonstrate Final Fantasy VII in HD, surely they can bring the fascinating concepts of that game to their modern productions.

Much has been made of the series becoming more marketable, or mainstream. First off, I think many conclusions about the progression of the series are based on faulty data. Most of the installments have sold very, very well. Final Fantasy is one of the best-selling franchises outside of the profligate Wii titles. Final Fantasy VII was one of the best-selling games on the PlayStation. There was, and is, a market for legitimate titles in this series. I don't expect that to change any time soon. More to the point of XIII specifically, many of the changes can simply improve the series, so long as gameplay remains strong.

The graphics in this title are stunning. They set a new standard for what I expect from blockbuster titles. The graphical style seemed to have been planned meticulously, and the cutscenes are truly of cinematic quality. You have to credit Square Enix for bringing these kind of graphics to aging consoles. These presentational advances do give me hope for the future of the series. Square Enix surely realizes the mixed reception this game received, especially for one as hyped and long-coming as this. I trust them to bring back the power and enjoyability of the job and turn systems from older entries, while continuing to push ahead with beautiful worlds.

However, I was disappointed at some of the choices the programmers made.  Let me first state that my favorite part of the previous games was ""Crash"" mode.  In the new game, ""Crash"" is nowhere near as fun as it was.  First of all, you can't simply play ""Crash"" as a stand-alone game.  And as other reviewers have noted, the start mechanic takes away a lot of player control.  And crime of crimes, they've done away with the instant replay!  Restarting takes way longer than it should, and the crash courses just don't have the same ""I gotta do that again"" feel that the other games had.  In the regular racing mode, some of the obstacles are too hard to see -- you find yourself crashing into things that you didn't know were there.  On the plus side, it is indeed fun to rear end cars and knock them out of the way.  The graphics and car handling are excellent.  My advice: if you're new to the series, buy Burnout 3 instead.  If you're a fan of the series, you should rent this before you buy it.  If it was $20 (as it will be 6 or 8 months from now), it'd be a no brainer purchase.

The Unreal 3 Engine used to power the graphics looks stunning when maxed out and excellent even when not. Moreover, these settings can often be maxed out on lower-end/notebook PC systems with no appreciable frame rate drop.  The downsides include mildly repetitive game play, a rather poorly implemented targeting system for hand-to-hand, ranged combat and jumping, as well as yet possibly unresolved technical issues for some users. As a personal experience, the only true issue I ever encountered was the so-called ""umbrella bug"" where the Umbrella weapon, used for blocking attacks and literally impossible to play without past early levels, could not be reassigned as other keys can without breaking its functionality (even after being reset to default settings). However, this could be fixed by using a text editor to very easily change the default key in the games text-based configuration files. The procedure is easily available on the internet. Still, I am not aware of any patch to address this issue by EA. And this is potentially a game breaker, as noted earlier. So product support is not superb for the PC version and bugs at one point even afflicted console users. Likewise, EA included some special dresses that were in the basic game, but only available in a special version (on-disk DLC) and again were easily accessed via configuration file changes anyone can do. EA seems to have dropped the ball in these areas. Still, not a bad game -- lush environments, hidden platforms, side-scrolling mini-platform games, imaginative enemies, tooth collecting, slides, interesting outfits with different powers and a variety of upgradable weapons all help keep things going despite a perhaps predictable ending, targeting inaccuracies in both aiming and jumping and sometimes inscrutable conditions for victories against major enemies.

Therefore, it pains me somewhat to criticize the final entry of the Resistance franchise, but I must be honest with how I felt about this game. You should probably play it if you've come this far in the series, but it's a step backward for Resistance.

Somehow, the graphics in this series keep getting worse, which is confusing. Resistance 1 looked the best (and it was a launch game!), Resistance 2 took a step backward as it became grayer and muddier, and #3 is the ugly duckling of the bunch, continuing the downward spiral into the ""bleak"" style of graphics that have been so popular for this console generation. There was one segment where I could just barely, barely see where I was going for a PROLONGED period of time, as I blindly stumbled about in the dark. It wasn't scary or suspenseful- it was just frustrating.

The other HUGE letdown for this game was that Insomniac threw the one feature that really set Resistance apart right out the window (with the exception of Halo): They make you shoot human beings. I understand they were trying to create the desperation of a post-apocalyptic world, but one of the best things about the world of Resistance is that it's an FPS series where you get to shoot nothing but aliens and monsters (up until this point). It's fun to cut loose in an FPS without getting hung up on the moral quandaries of battling those of your own species, simply because you happen to live in different countries with opposing agendas.

Finally, the ending feels rushed, and quite frankly, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. For a series that started out with such a fascinating and gripping narrative, it's disappointing to experience such a lackluster finale. I had hoped for so much more.

Resistance 3 certainly has its moments... the standout, for me, was your experience in a Pennsylvania mining community, where the religious locals have become convinced that Satan inhabits their mine (it's really a giant Chimeran alien, as you can imagine). You should certainly play it if you've come this far in the battle against the Chimera, but if you're new to the series, stick with #1.",An okay finale for an outstanding series (campaign review),1346544000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

However, the controls for the wii are terrible!  It's like the creators really tried to work in the functionality of the wii remote (moving it, turning it, etc.) but did a poor job as such.  I find myself quitting the game out of frustration of not being able to perform the simplest of tasks.

For example, soon into the game you have to buy spices, and visit the spice man at the farmers market.  He eventually tests you, which you have to move your controller in a specific pattern in order to be accepted to buy his spices.  Try as I might, I could only get 2 out of 10 correct.  Mind you I'm an avid gamer, and not at all uncomfortable with handling the wii remote, or winning, what not.

Another frustration is peeling lettuce, yes sounds simple doesn't it!  You have to get the wii cursor just right, and keep your hand orientated, or else you'll fail and get ""poor"".  It doesn't feel like natural motions whatsoever.

Lastly something as simple as flipping a burger isn't easy.  You must perform the full flipping action, then the game ""accepts"" what you do, and you see an on-screen result.  There is a split second where you don't even know if you did it correct, and you start to try again.  Same goes with flipping pancakes, or omelets, etc.

I find to get the best control in the game, I have to be right in front of my tv (not off to one side or the other on the sofa), and very much concentrating on the task at hand.

Good luck with the game, but know the controls need a little work to be on par with some of the nicer wii games out there.

*** Update ***

I still give this game 3-stars for terrible controls, but if you have enough patience, you can figure out strategies that work with foods.  For example, Lettuce is easy now, you click, HOLD, and just move your control rapidly left/right.  I still have the most trouble with carving, and haven't found a good reliable way to do this quickly.

As for the spice chop game, you have to be directly in front of your tv, then imagine a 2foot x 2foot square in front of you.

It's slick, it's fast, it's immersive and it's good fun - battles are more challenging than they've been since around Final Fantasy IV and V, and the whole system is clearly well thought through.  Perhaps it's more reminiscent of Baldur's Gate and Summoner than of Final Fantasy; and that does leave it feeling unlike Final Fantasy at times.  But all the same, it's very slick and well made.

The trouble is the characters.

Try as I might, I can't care about them.  I don't like them.  Only Balthier of the main party is remotely interesting.  The villain, too, lacks any presence; there's no real Adversary here.  Oh, you know who he is, and who you're going to be up against; but there's no conflict.  You're fighting an Empire, and he's part of it, but there's no PERSONAL adversary, like Cloud versus Sephiroth, Seifer versus Squall, or Tidus and his old man.  Or diverting to a less well-made but better written game, the challenge between title character and deceptive demon in Summoner.  The enemy in this game is more complex in terms of motive; but because the game doesn't have the space to really explore it in depth and develop a real DARKNESS to him, you end up with an opponent who tends to seem washed-out and weak more than he feels sophisticated.

You just can't stand him up against the other Final Fantasy villains, and not think that he's a pale shadow of them.

It simply takes too much time waiting to build to a real conflict.  The story may be good - albeit badly told at times - but that's not enough without strong characters to pull it together.  A good story with weak characters is worse than a weak story filled with genuinely interesting people.

Like other people have said; side-quests are most of the fun of this game.  That's where the game engine can come into its own, and you can ignore the story altogether.  And unlike other Final Fantasy games, you feel no pull from it; no drive to continue.  If it was a book, you'd have stopped reading.

That said, it is not enough to bring the game above three stars. There is far too much 343 did wrong to this game and, really, to us as gamers. First and foremost, as we are on the topic of multiplayer, there is NO split-screen option to play locally with friends. That was a major mistake. The biggest draw to the original Halo (and original trilogy) was the ability to play with your friends. I have many fond memories of this. Even now, as I reach my late-20s, I still have friends over. While our gatherings no longer focus on video games, we almost certainly always wind up playing something. As much as we'd like to play this new game together, we simply can't. How big of a shame is that?

The story mode, as others have aptly said, feels like a slap in the face. It feels rushed and forced. If someone was to give you a 30-second summary of the story, you'd probably think it sounded like a great idea. In fact, it IS a great idea! But it was executed so poorly with what felt as little feeling or callback to what made the stories in the previous games so engaging and enjoyable. I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi story, but this was just very upsetting.

Warzone is one of the better improvements made to the series. Thinking strictly in terms of the Halo series, it is a GREAT addition. I almost exclusively play Warzone, as its a lot of fun, and the big-team battles are really something. That being said, the REQ system is also another slap in the face for dedicated players. There is a lot to get into here, but the system is very familiar to anyone who has seen the ever-increasing amount of in-game purchases everywhere.

I play enough, but even still I find the system frustrating. I can easily see how it would be a major turn-off to a casual player.

If we're going to be fair to this game, we need to take an unadulterated look at what the game is and does instead of its history.

Let's lay those answers out right now: Too Human is merely decent, and it doesn't do all that much. What it does do is present a loot-intensive dungeon-crawler in Nordic clothing. For those of you who aren't familiar with Diablo, the conceit is this: Choose a class of warrior, each with differing strengths and weaknesses. Then cut through hordes and hordes of peon-style enemies. Then collect the piles and piles of money, weapons and armor they drop. Also accumulate experience points with which to increase your dude's abilities, which can result in any number of damage-increasing bonuses.

It definitely goes beyond the mindless dreck that is Dynasty Warriors. There are tons of ""runes"" scattered about which you can insert into open slots of your weapons and armor, reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII's materia system. These runes serve to increase your damage potential, defense, probability of special effects (such as slowing down your enemy), and more.

So, certainly, there's quite a bit of content in Too Human as far as the collectibles and bonuses are concerned. The problem, though, is in actually playing through the game in order to get to that content. The combat is touted as fluid and accessible. Based mostly around the right analog stick, at first it seems as such. Pointing and holding in the direction of your enemy to attack is as simple an activity as you could hope for in an action-roleplaying game, and perhaps too simple: It starts to feel brain-dead very quickly.

So the game affords you the ability to mix it up by launching enemies into the air, assaulting them with any number of firearms, unleashing a ""Ruiner"" special move (not unlike a smart bomb in a space shooter), deploying your mechanical spider companion to cause bonus damage, and executing a combo finisher.

The good news is that this all remains accessible, as the commands to pull these off are simple button presses. The bad news is that it's mechanically and visually clumsy to launch your enemies into the air, which is a key component of combat. Double-tapping your analog stick to launch isn't difficult, but it just feels uncomfortable, especially given that you'll be doing it quite often. There's nothing pleasant about it. Visually, your enemy just kind of floats in the air while you follow it up and start to wail on it -- as if you're both standing on invisible platforms. It takes some of the physicality and even skill out of air combat, leaving you wishing for the visual stimuli of Devil May Cry -- the original Playstation 2 game that was released seven years ago.

So, you've got this odd phenomenon of mindless, almost boring combat that somehow takes more focus than it should simply because it's uncomfortable. You've also got environments that largely consist of wide open, mechanical-looking rooms. With the exception of some different color hues, everything looks very similar and thus gets old really fast -- just like the combat.

Yet, as with any loot-based game, it remains compelling for the simple prospect of collecting that next great piece of armor or that new sword. I'd personally stopped playing it after one playthrough in single-player and a few hours of multiplayer because the gameplay simply could not keep me interested past slightly-more-than-minimal due diligence, but I can definitely see the appeal there. Tinkering with your weapons and runes is a great time-sink diversion, and sometimes there's nothing better than coming home from a tough day and laying it all out on enemies that don't do much to resist.

In sum, then, Too Human has its merits. It doesn't do much, but if you fit the mold, it does enough. It isn't that great, but depending on your mood, it doesn't need to be. Nonetheless, here's to hoping that the next two installments of the trilogy are more involved and more varied.

The Bad: Shallow fight system, only 12 characters, lack of modes, lame story

The PS2 wasn't without its fighting games, and most were solid. The Bloody Roar series started on the PS1, but has seen rocky acclaim ever since its first entry. Competing with games such as Street Fighter, Tekken, and Virtua Fighter at the time, people didn't see the need for another Japanese fighter. Bloody Roar features some interesting characters that can turn into Beast form which unlocks a new set of moves and some devastating attacks. Bloody Roar 3 has great visuals and solid controls, but lacks a large roster and modes that fighters are known for.

First off, the game only has 12 fighters. That's tiny even compared to other fighters with small rosters. The characters, however, are unique but there is a serious lack of female fighters (only 4). The stages are busy and well designed, plus the game looks great even for today. The fight system is simple compared to most Japanese fighters, but I preferred this. There is just punch, kick, and beast form as well as a dodge and block button. The game has no move list, so this is for button mashers which is just fine here. The controls are smooth and responsive, and there is a lot of visual flair. The characters' beast forms look really cool, and it is fun to see them all.

Another main disappointment are the lack of modes. Just arcade, survival, and versus really. There's not even a main story mode, but the arcade mode does go through all the characters stories. I found the story to be pretty boring and unexciting like most fighting game stories. Most Japanese fighting fans will mainly dislike the lack of depth in the fight system, but I really didn't mind it.

Overall, Bloody Roar 3 is a solid fight game, but just feels bare bones. The fight system lacks depth, the character roster is small, and there's only 3 modes. The game look great and the controls respond well, so this is a love it or hate it type of game.",A decent but thin fighter,1347926400,,,
3.0,False,"10 18, 2010",A19N698DWTYPHD,B003UT9XII,Ryan,"I'd like to reiterate what's been noted above - this is NOT a real simulation.  I don't think there are any console games that come even close to reality (though I haven't yet tried GT5, Forza 2 is definitely not, but closes in on reality).

First, so I can stop being jaded, let me get through the major annoyances and go on to the positives - and there are a lot!):

1) Physics suck - not realistic in the least bit even in full ""sim"" mode, it's an arcade game easily accessible to any level of ""driver"".

2) You can't look where you're going!  This makes it tough to drive.  When coming to a really sharp turn, where you'd generally swivel your head to see where you're going, you CAN'T.  This makes learning a track tough.  Especially since you can't even review a track map whilst in the pits!  There is an on-screen map, but since you're arriving at the corners quickly, you can't actually see the corner until your past it.  Annoying.

3) In the rain, it's dark.  And yes, I know that's the point!  The graphics are amazing to me, but the raindrops don't move (they should theoretically streak back, no?) and since we're not driving realistic cars, why do I have to strain my eyes to see where I'm going?  Also, if you're driving in the rain, you're likely to have a clear visor, not a darkened one.  There's no in-game brightness adjust, and for the life of me I can't figure out why, other than to make you blind.

4) Replays are annoying.  The cameras are great EXCEPT for the ""TV"" view, which changes cameras every 2 seconds and does this annoying shake routine and it's nearly impossible to get a consistent view of what you just did.  Would be nice to do that.

5) No way to compare telemetries.  Why can't I come into the pits and review my telemetry to see where I'm braking, if I'm braking consistently, how quickly I'm getting to the throttle out of corners, if I'm going truly flat through corners, and where my team-mate is making up time on me?

6) Noticed today that braking distances are exactly the same in the dry and in the wet.  That goes again under ""physics SUCK.""  Oh well.

7) One more little thing - the force feedback sucks.

NOW, sorry for the rant, on to the great!  Note: I'm using the Microsoft XBox FFeedback Wheel

1) The graphics are amazing - I love them!  The details are phenomenal.

2) TOTALLY accessible!  Again under the heading that Physics SUCK, but so what, it's fun and you can drive a wicked car around your favorite F1 track!  It's cool, and anybody can play it and come up to speed with reasonable success.  It makes it fun when anybody can jump in the seat and go for a whirl without fear of being too embarrassed.

3) Career mode is really cool, realistic enough, and fun!  It really puts you in the place, just about as much as it should.  =)

As it stands the last three should outweigh the first bunch for almost all people.  For the simulation junkies like myself, this game is fun and still challenging enough to be fun, but it's not quite what we were hoping for.  One would hope they'd give us the impossible realities just to experience it.  Ah, such is life.

Its pure violence as you pummelled shocked the gaming world and sent parents into outrage. The violent scenes as you ommitted your characters specific fatality move on your oponent had those uptight parents fainting with shock. Because of this, it almost makes me sad to see how much this games violence has been toned down. If anything, the violence should have been pushed to even more brutal heights to make the experience more gruesome and fun. Over the past few years, preceding this particular edition MK much like other classic button mashing fighter games, they adopted the 3D platform with more complicated controls. Many old school fans didn't like this, which has led to a big change into the control system of this particular chapter.

This instalment, as you can probably tell by the title pits MK legends against DC universe' finest. Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel, The Flash, Joker, Catwoman, Darkseid, Wonder Woman, Deathstroke & Lex Luthor for Team DC. Raiden, Liu Kang, Shang Tsung, Shao Khan, Baraka, Scorpion, Sub Zero, Kitana, Jax, Kano and Sonia for team Mortal Kombat. In regards to characters, if your favourite isn't there then don't fret as it's been confirmed that we should expect downloadable content which would include new characters, so there's a possibility your favourite may show up there. I'm personally hoping for Doomsday so I can kill Superman, in a classic comic book way and hopefully Bain.

This isn't full of different modes, it's 3 very simple prospects to get your head around. There's the classic arcade mode where you take one character and fight your way through the ranks, ending with a really tough character who you will have to have a few goes at before you get that win. Kombo Challenge which is possibly the most difficult thing I've ever played on a game of this kind. Basically every character has the ability to perform a massive attack combo chain and this challenges you to perform that. Keep in mind the difficulty is due to the fact that it needs precise timing and accuracy in your movements, which can get a bit frustrating. Story Mode is the main aspect of this game and I'm sure is the main thing all fans will play first. It's split into two seperate stories, one being from the MK perspective and the other from the DC perspective. You enter into a number of different battles while the story explains exactly how the universes came together.

I mentioned the game mechanics earlier and it's something I need to touch upon in more detail. This installment has gone a step back from the newly created 3D style of movement and gone back to it's 2D platform routes. Moving in a 3D fashion is still available making use of the analogue stick. They have now also introduced a number of minigames within a match such as Klose Kombat, Test your Might and free fall. Test your might enters you into a little test as you force your opponent through a number of walls and button mash to increase the damage level. Free Fallin is on the same level as that but you throw your opponent off an edge and jump after them, punching and kicking them as you both fall. I've not tried Klose Kombat so can't really comment on that particular feature just yet, but my review will be updated when I have.

The effects are absolutely amazing and manage to effectively give both a cartoon feel and a realistic look to both MK and DC characters. Superman and Green Lantern looking most like their page counterparts and remaining loyal to their specific traits. Flash's moves are easily the coolest as you move at almost the speed of light to batter your opponent from every angle. The only problem I have with this is that Flash uses it to his advantage when he's your opponent and basically gives you no chance to get a hit in and before you know it you're dead. There are no real extra features and the online is pretty simple as you enter chatrooms and challenge people to a bout.

All in all this is a very good game with a lot of fun to be had, though with very minimal unlockables it's already gotten tired for me and I'm now looking for the next best game which is unlikely to arrive until the new year.

The ""futuristic"" weapons are fun to use and offer a bit of fresh air on the traditional ""pistol, shot gun, flame thrower"" mix that one usually expects in these types of games. Furthermore the enemies are challenging, and to successfully defeat them you have to ""strategically"" target various body parts to most efficiently put them down, simply put the combat is very very fun. Next the environments are beautiful, the various places you will go are reminiscent of a big budget sci fi movie. On the negative side the story is quite poor and does not develop/conclude in a manner that is at all engaging or satisfiying. Furthermore the game is quite short, it is a 10-12 hour experience. Now even though the story is dissapointing, those 12 hours of gameplay are very challenging and very fun. If this game had a more fully developed/executed story this would be a 5 star game.

The two minigames can be fun, but are a bit simplistic for a game this dark. Either your scratching through people to find and eliminate worms, or you're playing ""pop the bubbles before they burst"". It's hard to mess them up even intentionally, and I was hoping for more plot/thought driven puzzles to be mixed in.

There is no thought involved in getting through this game. Areas you need to go to are always highlighted, helping to avoid needless wandering but also any bit of thought on where to go. There can be several highlighted areas at once but after one you can just go to the next with little to no penalty.

Text is very very long, and when you combine that with localization issues what you end up with is long sprawls of people talking about events you get the gist of but not a lot of details. After a while it will start to put you to sleep. To make things worse your response options to the average bit of dialog go like this:

1. Caring answer
2. Snarky answer

Sometimes there's a third option but it doesn't really add anything. A saving grace at least is that somehow the vocal track always makes more sense then the text, so if you're lost try to stop reading and just listen to the dialog. Unfortunately not all parts are voiced. Odd as it is the game is still kind of fun which is why I gave it a 3 but on a 1-10 scale it's probably a 5.

3.0,False,"05 9, 2014",A306153FTKS9PL,B00HRKE1SI,Turtle502,"I've used my fair share of Turtle Beach headsets, both wired and wireless. This product is as basic as they come, while providing critical functionality with the Xbox One. They are good, but not necessarily great.

Since these are wired, there's nothing to charge. There are no buttons or switches on the headset. There's a permanently wired cable that comes from the bottom of the left ear-cup. The boom-mic plugs into a jack on the bottom of the left ear-cup. Ideally, I wish it were made so you could plug the boom-mic into either ear-cup, in case you have a preference. I find the cable a bit short. While it works great from controller-to-headset, it's a bit short for other applications -- such as using it for listening to music on a PC or phone, for example.

The headset has a good construction, very unique as compared to other Turtle Beach headsets I've used. The head band flexes firmly as you pull apart the ear-cups to place the headset on your head, but doesn't close too tightly. Disclosure: I have a small head. There's a strip of leather-like padding that sits on top of your head. I keep a permanent buzzcut, and this padding feels great for long periods of time. The ear-cups are padded with a simple foam and cloth material instead of leather, which in my opinion keeps them cooler -- and you feeling cooler -- while using them. The ear-cups extend lower so they can be sized to your head, and they swivel to provide a decent fit.

I've used these for hours at a time with no discomfort.

These sound good, with decent overall sound in terms of bass and treble, but I find that the midrange -- especially voices -- seem to be a bit weak. This is surprising considering these are a complete solution, with voice chat being a major feature. Since there's nothing electronic about this headset, there's no way to compensate for this. Additionally, when listening to music or podcasts from another device, your control of the sound is limited to the controls available on that device. Additionally, the volume output is limited to the power that can be provided by your device. Phones are less likely capable of driving these at higher volumes.

These are specifically marketed for use with Xbox One, because it includes the headset adaptor which snaps onto the bottom of the Xbox One controller. I ran into trouble performing the update. While my first attempt to update the controller (more of an Xbox One issue than the headset's) failed, a second attempt was successful and provided full functionality. The headset adaptor allows the Xbox One console to send chat AND full game audio to the controller, which is then passed to this headset (or any headset) plugged into it.

Unfortunately, it's not a completely wireless solution because you'll always have a wire going from the controller to the headset. If you need to get up temporarily, you either need to take the controller with you (say, to the kitchen) or take the headset off. This is why I wish the cable was longer, because it would allow you to move around your immediate area if you need to put the controller down temporarily.

Sound quality wirelessly through the controller is actually quite good. Full game audio is clean and crisp and sound full-spectrum from my perspective. The adaptor on the controller offers the ability to mute chat, change the volume between chat and game audio, and control overall volume. There's no mute, though, for game audio -- which is a bit annoying if somebody walks into the room and needs to ask you a question.

The product also includes the necessary in-line amp and cable solutions that can be used with your Xbox 360 and PC.

If you are looking for a complete chat and game audio solution for your Xbox One, and don't desire any bells-and-whistles, then you should give these a try. They are pretty much plug-and-play, then forget it. They sound good, fit good, and work well with the Xbox One.","Completely wired, no bells and whistles",1399593600,,,

3.0,False,"02 17, 2009",A1VDI1GQKNVA7U,B001AH1CX6,Judah,"Important note -- the full version of Fate #1 comes as part of this game!  If you don't have either Fate game, this is the one to buy.

This game is basically Fate #1, but requiring more mouse clicks and equipment with elemental resistances (they pushed magic in this game, it was weaker in the first).  Instead of one normal dungeon, you have two realms.  A forest realm with an insect theme and an ice realm with arctic creatures.  You need to defeat a boss in each of these realm dungeons before the 'normal' dungeon (copied directly from the first fate) opens up, containing some of the new monsters from the realms.

What I mean by 'more clicking' is the realms aren't designed well at all.  Your stash and the enchanter only exist in the ice realm, but each realm has two characters which exist only to take out gems, and these characters are centrally located so you accidentally talk to them.  The healer in the forest realm is off to the side and surrounded by tree stumps, which are at the exact angle for your character to get stuck behind on the walking approach.  It's truly annoying because if you are doing the forest realm, you don't want to go to the ice realm and hit four screens of loading just to visit your stash.

Also, because of the way the dungeons scale, you'll have to keep going back and forth between the realms on the 'higher' difficulty settings (I played on hero), since the monsters can become too much for you to handle.

The other annoying thing about the game was when you unlock the 'final' dungeon, suddenly all the NPC only give quests for the 'final' dungeon, and not their realms anymore, restarting at level one.  I ended up blowing through the first 20 levels of the 'final' dungeon in one sitting (without realizing this), so did without quests for the last few hours of the game.  This wasn't very fun.

As far as I could tell they kept the same equipment from the first game.  They added more fish types, but all the new pets walk so slowly they are essentially useless in combat.  They also added 'fate' cards, where if you are lucky to find 3 cards, you give them to a fortune teller.  The rewards are useless, usually normal gems or 4000 gold.  A big letdown.  Oh, and there are two new types of quests.  A hunt down 'multiple moving objects' quest that gets old after doing it once, and shrines.  I liked the shrines until I realized the firewall spell answered the defending/attacking dilemma perfectly.  Then it was just waiting one minute while spamming the spell.

Overall, this game takes a LOT longer to finish the the original fate with not much added.  So if you are heirlooming up items for deep-delving, you are better off playing the first game and only importing your character if you want to try the ice or forest dungeon as a change of pace.

Personally, I found it less fun than the first fate.  You do get the first game with the second one, so if you don't have the first one, getting the second one is a good package deal.

Vendetta has museums, prisons, streets, pool halls, police stations, observatories, fish factories and...Nakatomi Plaza, again.

It's a shame the RPG element of the game wasn't developed more. Instead of being yet another first-person shooter with the Die Hard name, a lot more could have happened if the gameplay had evolved from just running around and shooting. Fun it may well be, but a lot more it could have been too.

3.0,False,"09 30, 2005",A31GVQQQOX0056,B0006FZUHC,Cosmos,"Touted as the ""First D&D Real-Time Strategy Game"", Dragonshard certainly brings some new fare to a genre that can often seem rote.

The ""D&D"" aspect of this game should be addressed before delving further. Based in the new D&D campaign world of Eberron, the graphics, storyline and overall feel of the game certainly captures the unique flavor of the campaign setting and gives a sense of the depth found in it.

Unfortunately, that is by and large where the ""D&D"" in the title ends. The game mechanics are not at all representative of Dungeons and Dragons and the reality is that it is D&D in name and flavor only. What little of D&D it parodies, outside of setting, it doesn't follow very closely and I suspect that most D&D fans who were hoping for something true to the game system itself will find themselves sorely disappointed on this count.

If you took away the Eberron setting I might half-jokingly suggest that it would border on the criminal to continue to call it a D&D game at all. Certainly those players familiar with D&D but not with Eberron will find this anything but a D&D title.

If you can get past that in the hope of finding a fun game underneath, and are willing to engage the necessity of learning an RTS in which knowledge of the D&D game system will fail to help you with in the least, you may find yourself both entertained and perhaps a bit addicted.

Graphically the game is well done and holds much in comparison to Warcraft III, but is more refined and detailed. The environments and units offer a lot in the way of eye-candy and the voice and sound that accompanies it are all very well done and convincing. In particular I found the Lizardfolk to be exceptional in this respect.

Beyond mere appearance, the actual game play is engaging and offers a plethora of strategy along the way. It doesn't really come into its own until you have become quite familiar with the varied troop types for each of the ""civilizations"" in the game. This is made more difficult due to the mechanics of the game as well as a lack of consistency between the traits of one unit to those in another civilization. Allow me to speak toward that a bit more in a moment.

As with most RTS games, a scissor-rock-paper model exists that require a player to form armies capable of countering the enemy while avoiding being countered at the same time. In Dragonshard the main means of holding to this model is through ""resistances"", of which four types can be found; magic, poison, fire and physical. Virtually all units in the game are resistant to three types of damage and are weak to one.

Some special units, such as Champions for which a player can generally only have one active at any time, do what is called ""fierce"" damage, essentially ignoring any resistances of their target.

This, by and large, works well enough though it requires a bit of memorization to be effective and is not entirely consistent from one civilization to the next. For example, Lizardfolk warriors deal melee damage and are weak to magic, their equivalent in the ""Order"", the dwarf barbarian, deals melee damage and is weak to melee damage, and yet the final variety of warrior, the Umbragen Wraith Knight, deals magic damage and is susceptible to fire.

With ten unit types available to each side, not including champions and juggernauts, this disparity between comparable unit damage types and resistances can cause a fair bit of mental juggling, particularly as you try to get accustomed to the rest of the game.

Along with these considerations, many if not most of the units have several special powers which become available as they increase in level. These powers range from healing and buff spells to direct and area of effect attacks, all par for the course. However, their use is frequently hampered by user interface issues that can leave you fumbling about the keyboard as a frantic battle ensues, all in the hopes of trying to utilize these unit powers to best effect against enemy units you have hopefully memorized the weaknesses of in the process.

If that sounds like it might be a bit tedious or difficult, you would be right. At least before you've become accustomed to these requirements of the game it can leave a person a little confounded.

Naturally, the best way to overcome this and gain familiarity with both the mechanics and user interface is to simply play the game a lot! Fortunately, even when lacking as a player the game hints at a gem underneath drawing you in further and further, and imbuing some familiarity along the way.

Perhaps this is because, for all the similarities with other RTS titles, Dragonshard breaks the mold a bit by combining attributes from the best of them while introducing a new layer that I don't think has yet found its way into the genre--dungeon adventuring.

On the surface world, the area where you engage army against army, defend your city and outposts, and generally manage the strategic aspects of the game, periodic rains of ""dragonshard"" fall from the sky providing a necessary resource to send your troops out to collect.

However, below the surface exist damp and dark evils into which you must send the captains of your above ground armies seeking out treasure and gold, the second primary resource needed to build and create your forces.

This below ground adventuring helps add a lot of interesting depth to the game, in both single and multiplayer games. It also, inevitably, divides your attention between the gathering of dragonshard above and gold below, even as your troops engage enemy civilizations and creeping monsters on both, earning experience to level up all the while.

This division of attention, of forming both armies and adventure groups to obtain resources and defend or attack with, adds a dimension of strategy to the genre that simply can't be found elsewhere. Kohan comes, perhaps, closest to the same offering and its influence in this game can readily be recognized in many aspects.

Truly, as you play it's likely you'll find hints of other games abounding. The above ground realm and the variety of troops immediately conjures up moments from Warcraft, Majesty and Kohan, while the below ground spelunking is reminiscent of Baulder's Gate/Icewind Dale and to an extent the more recent Dungeon Seige 2.

Amazingly they have incorporated the more unique features of many games, both inside and out of the RTS realm, in a largely seamless fashion resulting in a game of a different sort than you might otherwise expect.

Most importantly, despite its failure to live up to the D&D name (in terms of game play itself), it rapidly grows on a person with its fun and multi-layered demands for strategy and foresight.

Detracting from this fun game play stands only two fairly brief campaigns and a wholly lacking online multiplayer community, at least so far. It also begs the question as to why only two campaigns exist when there are three civilizations featured in the game.

The longevity of this game, in terms of replayability and any notable online community are at best questionable. Certainly the online aspect of this game is absent so far and there doesn't seem to be any indication this will change soon, perhaps condemning most players to the short single player campaigns before hanging the game on a shelf to be forgotten.

In the end, while I really do find the game enjoyable, I have difficulty recommending it while it teeters at the $50 range. It has a lot of potential left unfulfilled even as it introduces some aspects which hopefully won't be ignored by the next generation of RTS games. It certainly could be worse and can't be coined a total failure, by any stretch of the imagination.

Yet with only a moderate level of replayability, deficient online play and an almost complete failure to offer what was advertised outside of setting alone--a D&D RTS--I can only feel it appropriate to recommend waiting for this to hit the bargain bin before spending your hard earned dollars.

Pro:

* Engaging and fun game play

* Pleasing graphics and sound/music

* Mold breaking strategic design, with above and below ground adventure

* For those inclined, the Eberron campaign setting

Con:

* Not really a D&D title, as per game mechanics

* User Interface design is lacking in some key parts

* Two short campaigns

* Virtually no online gaming available at the moment

* Undocumented (and perhaps broken) game editor

* Moderate to steep learning curve

* Some notable bugs reported for some even after a first patch",An attempt that simply missed the mark,1128038400,62,,
3.0,False,"07 23, 2007",A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000OPPR2C,Michael Kerner,"With the success of video games like Dance Dance Revolution, and Parappa The Rapper which recently got re-released for the PSP, many gamers have eagerly welcomed games that really were more about the music in them. Guitar Hero has been one of the most surprising games that really has worked very well in that success. The previous editions have made gamers want to kick their licks, and jam to their favorite smashes like Heart-Shaped Box by Nirvana. While gamers are anxiously awaiting a new version for the upcoming Playstation 3, those who own the PS2 get their chance to hit the stream of the 80's in this band.

Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks The 80's for the Playstation 2, is a spinoff from Activision popular music game that tries to tide over fans awaiting what will be in store on Guitar Hero III. The gameplay is very simple as you jam along with your favorite songs from the 80's, from guilty pleasures and one-hit wonders, to acts that were just hard core. The variety is already mixed with legends like The Police on Synchroncity II and Electric Eye from Judas Priest, to some acts that only feel like it is the 80's like The Vapors smash Turning Japanese and The Warrior from Patty Smyth and Scandal. The graphics and control deliver nicely, but I just wish that there could've been a lot more in the way of rock that should've been included. I was honestly hoping for acts like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Pat Benetar and R.E.M. who really wrote and performed great Rock songs to be highlighted on this game.

All in all, Guitar Hero Encore: Rock's The 80's isn't a bad game but isn't quite enough to tide fans over who really want to party on down for a really good time. It still isn't a bad purchase for anyone who hasn't played Guitar Hero on the PS2 before, but you're better off awaiting for Guitar Hero III later this year, or just keep rocking on with Guitar Hero I & II in the meantime.

3.0,False,"12 22, 2008",A17M1HL6U2GS7M,B00149ND28,Storylover,"I am a game lover.  My wife and I play games together constantly.  We are solid gamers, each of us able to polish off most games on the ""normal"" setting pretty easily.  We are not spectacular players, we are not honed machines of video game grace.  But we play for hours every week and have done so for years, so we are not newbies by any stretch of the imagination; please take my complaints about this game with that in mind--if you are a polished videogame diety, then you will have less trouble than we did.  If you are a newbie, well then, pay extra attention--this game's fun quotient (which is very high at times) is seriously hampered by its bizarre controls and frustrating requirements.

This is a visually arresting game--the style is clean and modern, beautiful to look at.  It is as if the entire city agreed to a limited but brilliant palette, and keeps everything really clean.  The buildings are interesting to look at, and the places that you play through are full of fun things to jump on and over.  My wife and I are fascinated by parkour in real life, so finding a beautiful looking game that focuses on parkour made us really happy at first.  We also like the style of animation--very Adult Swim cool.  We were a little confused as to why the game animation style varies so greatly from the story animation, but overall that is not a big deal.  Both are fun to watch, and the animation is great both directions.  The story line is interesting and keeps you moving, even when you are contemplating pulling the disc out of your PS3 and lighitng it on fire.  Or kicking the game designers in their collective shins.

So yea, first person parkour was way cool.  At first.  Then the frustration began.  This game is essentially a platformer (our favorite type of game, we usually rock at these games) with first person moves.  And in all fairness, when things flow, it is really fun.  Not quite as fun as moving through the streets for the first time was in Assassin's creed, but close to that fun.  You jump from obstacle to obstacle, under pipes, over huge gaps in buildings...breathtaking.  The downside is you can't see all the cool moves you are getting to do, and that is kind of a shame.  You have this superbad character you are playing, but you never really get to see her in action.  I'd like to see a replay option in 3rd person as a bonus.

Unfortunately, there are many times when you are under pressure--either someone is shooting you, or for some other reason you have a time issue.  This would not be bad if the game were better at directing you...but it sucks at this.  ""Ah!"" you exclaim, ""but that is the beauty of the game! You must find your own way!"" you say.  Well, that is a legitimate point, within reason.  There have been more than one occasion in which the way forward can only be reached in a single fashion, and the secret is pretty well hidden.  That is fine if you aren't getting shot at...but if you keep dying because a sniper is shooting you and you don't know where to go...and if it happens 10-15 times...and if you keep getting set back in front of a difficult obstacle you have to conquer first, and that also kills you 10-15 times...then somewhere the game designers didn't really think about what they were doing.  Yes, we got past all of them eventually, but the repetition it took us (and we are good gamers, mind you) got really boring and frustrating.  After a while it wasn't fun any more, and when a game becomes not fun, then it makes you wonder why you are playing it.

And while I am on the subject of snipers (and other gun toting baddies in general), whoever designed the combat portion of this game deserves to be taken out back and forced to fight like our heroine.  Guns are few, far between, non-flashy or exciting to use, have no aiming aid (a real bummer), and are essentially temporary--you can't store them on your person.  And guns are the good part--your personal ability to fight is there...she does have some moves (nice spin kick!), but executing them in any reasonable fashion against their bad guys is not easy to do, and you die a lot.  A lot.  A lot.  Once more, frustrating, why am I playing this game?

Also, I have a huge issue with the controls.  Some people have complemented DICE on the controls.  I say that whoever designed the controls for the PS3 needs to have their head examined.  L1 is jump? The single most frequently used button in the game is L1? Really? Oh, and the second most used control is L2? OK, if you are willing to buy into L1 is jump, then L2 as duck makes sense.  But I respectfully suggest that allowing some control re-assignment would be better for those of us who are used to X being jump--because 5000 other games have taught us that x=jump!  And whoever made the virtually useless R1 ""insta-reverse"" should be shot with a water gun full of curdled goat milk.  ""Insta reverse"" is very useful in some jumping situations, but R1 has often been ""Fire!"" or other things in other games, and let me tell you that hitting R1 in a fight can spell your rapid death.  Sounds simple.  But whatever.  In this day and age, there is no excuse for controls that a player doesn't like not being completely reassignable--or at least having alternative control schemes.  Something.  My wife and I both think that this was our number one complaint.

Wow, so after reading that, you must think that there is no reason to play this game at all.  And you would be wrong, because when the frustrating portions of the game are not bothering you, this game is one of fluid grace, of breathtaking running, jumping climbing excitement.  She moves like a dream, when she is allowed to do so, and for those moments when things are going well, it is just magic.  Pure magic.  I loved those portions.

In the end, I would not buy this game again, knowing what I know.  It was tons of fun for a few moments, and then some fun for a lot more moments, but not much fun at all for about half of it.  I would consider buying a sequel if the game designer takes some of these complaints into consideration--and I know that I am not the only one who feels this way--other reviewers on professional sites have had the same complaints about replaying levels over and over again until they get them right.

So how do you know if it is your cup of tea? Rent it!  Check out a demo!  If you dig it, don't hesitate to throw down  the 60 bones for a really unique experience.  But if you have a hard time, then renting is really a better choice.

I felt like the original Yokai watch was one of the most detailed and beautiful looking games on the 3DS just because of how you could really tell what the items on the store shelves are. What I mean is, the creators worked hard on even the small details and their efforts altogether made Yokai Watch such a pleasing game for the eyes.

The same can be said of the sequel....however, that's both a good thing and a bad thing. Most of this game takes place in exactly the same place that the first game took place in. So I guess if it looks just as beautiful thats kind of a given...since it's the same stuff..... I expected a brand new adventure with Yokai only to find out that I'm basically doing what I did in the first game....again. Different story but in the same places! That was such a huge disappointment to me. I was really looking forward to exploring more stunning areas in the world of Yokai Watch and it just comes across as a little bit lazy to me.

  --inFamous takes place in a ruined city--

  inFamous: Action, medium-sized open world, fast combat, upgradable powers.

  This review contains no spoilers.

  As stated above, inFamous takes place in a ruined city ravaged by plague and anarchy. You play the hero (or anti-hero, you later decide, based on your actions) Cole. You were told to deliver a mysterious package. About halfway through your delivery, you are told to open the package. Upon opening it, a tremendous and devastating explosion erupts from it, destroying everything around you, killing everyone - except you. After picking your way through the ruins to safety, you find that you have attained amazing electrical powers. As you progress through the story, you quickly gain new and powerful abilities. I will now list the pros and cons of inFamous.

  Pros:

  Engaging storyline - The inFamous storyline takes you through the triumphs and struggles that come with mastering your new powers. People in the story will try to dissuade you from your path, and many would like to have your powers as well, even if they have to go to dangerous lengths to get it. The ending, no spoiler, will blow your mind. Guarenteed. No one will/has ever seen it coming.

  Tons of things to do - While you always have the storyline to turn to for a good time, you also have multiple side missions that later define your character. (As discussed in a later Pro-con). You can also collect what are called Blast Shards, shards left behind from the blast that gave you your powers, to further enhance your powers.

  Good at making you feel powerful - Of all the games I've played (an unending plethora of them), none have made me feel as powerful as inFamous did. You can literally destroy everything in sight (besides buildings, of course) cars, crates, barrels, people. Your massive array of powers will undoutedly give you a feeling of almightiness. You can (maybe a tiny semi-spoiler) later unlock new powers as you progress through the story, some of which allow you to glide, throw shock grenades, and many more.

  Open World - inFamous doesn't have the biggest explorable world ever, but it certainly is fairly large. Again, plenty of things to do, improving your character, and blissfully wreaking havoc wherever you see fit.

  Good or Evil? - Many players like being able to decide whether their character is good or evil. The missions and actions that you complete throughout the game define the character you are. If you are good, citizens will cheer for you and praise you, but if you're evil they will throw rocks at you and certain evil bosses become fond of you. The road that you decide to ride on the good or evil interstate determines some powers that you can attain later on, each standing having its own power.

  Cons:

  Not the best graphics - Not the best graphics... Few games have really made ""best graphics"". The graphics in inFamous are a little shoddy, but not to the point of un-playability. Movements of the characters, such as tilting their heads or flinching in your presence are abrupt, quick. Anyone who has played Sucker Punch's earlier game, Sly Cooper, should have that recollection. Overall on the graphics, they could be better, but definitely meet the standards expected in a PS3 game.

  Comic book cutscenes - Some people may find this to be a pro, maybe for being a creative idea on Sucker Punch's part. I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm sure some people may have some complaints about the fact that inFamous uses what looks like flipping comic book pages for cutscenes. They have small blotches of paint in the sides, which fans of the cutscenes should like. The only noticable flaw in the cutscenes is that it steals away from the action, whilst normal cutscenes would make better use of explosions and such.

  Limited enemies? - While not following the storyline (i.e doing miscellaneous quests) the player will find special, character determining side-mssions. Upon completing these side-missions, the player will receive an occasional reward, but the area in which you completed that mission in will be cleared of enemies. This will definitely be fun until you actually complete them all. Eventually the entire game will be cleared of enemies, and when combined with the fact that you've completed all the side missions, you'll be left with only the storyline, if you haven't completed that, and the collection of Blast Shards. You can awlays choose to avoid these side-missions, though.

  Ending - This con (or a pro, can't decide) contains no spoilers. I doubt that the ending will disappoint any players, but it may baffle many of them. An interesting and certainly unexpected twist in the end will more than likely leave many players scratching their heads, though the sequel is coming out/has come out.

  This is neither a pro nor a con, but inFamous does not have any blood, very little cursing, and no sexuality. It earned its T for teens rating because of all the senselss (and eerily fun) destruction you bring upon unsuspecting citizens.

  Overall, I would give inFamous 4 stars, maybe 3.85% out of 5%. not the best yet still fit the request graphics, no maturity features aside from rare-swears, gleeful destruction with the use of insurmountably devastating powers, engaging storyline, limited (though limit-ness can be avoided) enemies, and an unbelievably astonishing ending. Now that the price has gone down a bit since release, inFamous would be worth a try, though it's probably not worth $60 (some people may say differently, it's how you determine it). I'd give it an 8/10 rating.

3.0,False,"06 17, 2012",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B006FRNBB2,Elias,"""Katamari Damacy"" has always been somewhat of a favorite series to me. It has special emotional meaning to me as well, due to the fact that the first game in the series was the first present I ever received from my best friend. I've played every entry in the franchise, excluding ""Beautiful Katamari"", and every single one I've enjoyed thoroughly. With their excellent music, great gameplay variety, humorous dialogue, and loads of content, Namco's cult hit franchise is always a surefire hit. This time, however, things don't turn out so well. ""Touch My Katamari"" for the PS Vita is a total disappointment in all areas, and both as a gamer and longtime fan, it comes across as a complete slap in the face to the people who turned these quirky games into a strong franchise.

The King of Cosmos has been up to some wacky antics again... wait, no, not this time. This time around, the King has lost all of his strength due to years of complacency. He's turned into a slob, and lost much of the franchise's fanbase because of it. Turning once again to the Prince, he requests the rolling of several stars to fill his belly and restore his energy, and in turn win back the hearts of ""Katamari Damacy"" fans everywhere. With the hub world taking place on the side of the King's head, the Prince takes various requests from people, always bent around one core theme, to restore the series' strength.

How ironic that, from a fan's perspective, this is probably the most pitiful entry yet. The last time the series went handheld was on the PSP with ""Me and My Katamari"", which is actually one of my favorites in the series. That entry had plenty of gameplay, incentive to replay things, and multiple characters to play as, much like the console versions. This time, with higher res graphics and more ability to expand content, Namco-Bandai instead downsized the amount of things to do in this game.

The most glaring flaw is that, despite a new ability to morph the Katamari's shape using the touch screen, rolling up things in this game is an immensely unsatisfying experience. Sure, the gameplay is about as polished as it's ever been, but there's nothing to really do with it. The biggest thing you'll roll up in this game is probably a city or two... in the last level... out of 13 stages. About half of these are also side-missions, not the main ""Make It Big"" missions. Anybody who's played one of these games before will tell you that they're endeavors that can last quite a while until you beat them. Not so with this entry, which you can probably clear in anywhere between 2-4 hours. That's right, in one sitting, you can see most of what this game has to offer. After beating the main story, what's left? Well, you can get funny outfits for the King, and you can get quirky little collectibles by scouring the stages. That's about it. The bonus content in this game is thinner than a late 90's Kate Moss, and way less enticing.

Also a disappointment is the music, which has always been one of the best parts of the ""Katamari"" experience. The soundtrack in this game is a sorry affair, with barely any tracks, and most of the tracks there are very bland and uninspired. I wanted to find myself nodding along to these tracks, like I have in past entries, but I just couldn't get into it. In an attempt to match the quirkiness and variety of past soundtracks, the developers have lost sight of what made the past games sound so great.

Like a Katamari devoid of many objects, this game looks cool, and is intriguing in concept. However, much like that skimpy orb, it quickly makes it's lack of substance and ability known to players. Even though the gameplay is incredibly polished, and the imagery behind the stages is funny, and the plot is rife with laughs, this game is missing the soul and passion that made the others such memorable classics in the eyes of fans. If you're new to the Katamari franchise, this might be a good place to start. But if you've been playing for years, you might be better off not rolling it up until it's in the bargain bin.

Plot: 8 (Funny, but not as clever as previous entries.)
Gameplay: 6 (All rolled up, but nowhere to go. Not enough content.)
Graphics: 7 (Vibrant and pretty, but environments quickly stale.)
Sound:  6 (The worst part in a series built around great music.)
Overall: 6.75 (Fun for newcomers, but veterans will be left with a sour taste in their mouth.)

I left the theatre with bitter taste because the third installment of the Alien series wasn't even up there to be compared with the previous two movies.  What a disappointment...
I wouldn't be disappointed as nearly as I was disappointed that day if there were no such things as Alien, or Aliens.  It was bitter disappointment because I was left with no choice but comparing with two great predecessors.
Playing Ray Crisis gave me exactly same taste/feeling, which I felt when I was walking out of the movie theatre.  First installment, Galatic Attack, also known as Layer Section in Japan, was an awesome shooter games.  It was great enough to be compared to be those great shooter games out there such as Radiant Silvergun and Shienryu.  It was beautifully drawn, each level was designed with lot of thought, even the title of each stage was inspiring, coupled with excellent music by Zuntata.
Second installment, Ray Storm, which is an excellent game, not as good as the first one in my opinion, nevertheless, a GREAT game by today's standard.  It incorporated more of 3D looking yet the graphic was BELIEVABLE, not those choppy graphic.  The game play was also excellent, not as challenging as the first installment(but provided more than enough challenges), but surpassed Layer Section in terms of music and ending.  The ending of the first installment was good, meaning it was better than other typical games where it only shows credit.  However, Galatic Attack did something more than just showing credit.  Moreover, Ray Storm, which has to be the BEST ENDING EVER for any shooter games.  You gotta play the game to the end to see it for yourself.  With the story scrolling up, with EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT MUSIC, it raised itself from just mere shooter game to something even more.
Now, with all the good things said about first two games of the series...  Trust me, I was dying to play this very game.  When I played it through, I was left with this emptiness.  I might have enjoyed it up to certain extent if I haven't played the first two installment.  However, first two installment were way up there in terms of gameplay, graphic, music, ending, etc, Ray Crisis just does not live up to the 'legacy' of the series, just like Alien 3 the Movie.
I don't want to get into the detail why I was disappointed, gameplay(what happened?), GRAPHIC(it looks worse then Ray Storm???), music(not intuitive), etc.  I thought about how to describe this disappointment and came up with perfect description.
NO 'SOUL' HAS BEEN PUT INTO RAY CRISIS, PERIOD.
It's a decent game.  It's good enough to be enjoyed.  However, it's no near to be in same level with either Layer Section or Ray Storm.  What a disappointment, what a disappointment...

3.0,False,"10 28, 2006",A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00004U8KR,Daniel Jolley,"I've had the three Blair Witch computer games ever since I bought The Blair Witch Experience set several years ago, but I've never really taken any of them for a spin until now.  Given the pathetic nature of the second movie, I had to wonder what kind of content might be stretched across three whole games.  The Rustin Parr case makes a natural choice for the first volume, as it's really the most visceral and disturbing part of the fictional Blair Witch legend.  You all remember Rustin Parr - the guy who killed seven kids in his basement, walked to Burkittsville to announce he was finally finished, and testified that the Blair Witch made him do it.  You don't actually get to meet Rustin Parr in this game, but you do sort of follow in his footsteps.

In many ways, so they say, this is a sequel to Nocturne.  It uses the Nocturne engine and borrows the character of Elspeth ""Doc"" Holliday, a sort of pre-X-files agent investigating weird stuff for the ""Spookhouse.""  After a rather annoying but somewhat helpful tutorial-type workout at home base, you (as Holliday) are dispatched to Burkittsville to see if there's anything to the whole Blair Witch story or not.  It's 1941, just after Parr's arrest, and you have to explore the town, interview townsfolk, and - of course - explore the dark forests where evil is said to lurk.  The locals are rather tight-lipped and pretty darn lacking in personality, and your contact with them mostly consists of cut scenes - so there's not much challenge there.  You'll spend most of your time in the forest, which can be rather mazelike.  I don't know why computer game makers think we enjoy wandering around lost in a maze so much, but there you go.

You do get to kill things, though.  Since you can't go around shooting the residents of Burkittsville (unfortunately), the game makers came up with the idea of zombies, wild dogs, and stick creatures wandering the forests.  It's quite a stretch, really, as the whole Blair Witch thing sort of fades into the background of ancient Indian folklore (as recounted by a strange Indian living in the dark forest).  Clearly, gameplay and story depth are not this game's major strengths.

What makes the game interesting and, in its own little way, somewhat impressive is the atmosphere provided by the Nocturne engine.  The look of the game is quite effective, as are the sounds.  As you walk through the forest, your ears are treated to the sounds of the leaves crunching under your feet and the eerie sounds of children's voices somewhere off in the distance (some of whom are calling for help), while ghost-like images of children as well as beasts pop in and out of your sight.  The creepiness multiplies when you get the chance to explore the infamous Parr house, where shadows of children suddenly appear in the corners before fading away before your very eyes.  None of this is going to make you start calling for your Mommy, but there is a definite level of creepiness to this otherwise bland gaming experience.

In the end, though, the lack of challenging gameplay (and all the ridiculous wandering around in the forest trying to find your way) trumps the creepy atmosphere.  There's just too little to do, with too little payoff for your time and effort.  Different camera angles make for awkward control at times, and the third-person perspective keeps you from really being drawn into the action.  The ending is particularly blas, and so it is that I must declare The Blair Witch Volume 1: Rustin Parr a decidedly average gaming experience.","Great creepy atmosphere, but decidedly lacking in terms of gameplay",1161993600,3,,

I like sound that has good deep bass and clear sound. The 500's did NOT do this for me... Seriously, I've learned a very important lesson when it comes to gaming headphones that NO one tells you about (Because the average gamer doesn't know).... Gaming headphones and virtual surround are made for gamers who 'NEED' to hear footsteps coming up from behind them.

Saying that, most gaming headsets in virtual sound will mute or dumb down bass or environmental sound so you can hear things like footsteps very, very clear. Here's what I learned on my third pair of headphones... IF you aren't a FPS gamer and play all sorts of games, get a amplified stereo headset and save yourself a $100 or so dollars. 7.1 / 5.1 and all those gaming presets are for FPS gamers. I say this because I ended up going back to my TB X12's which are $40, I've had them for 5 years and the bass and treble are really well balanced and the bass rumbles in my ears. I went back and forth testing the X12's compared to the Gold's and 500s and I couldn't deny the difference AND they are only $40.

SO, as of yesterday I returned my 500's to Amazon and I'm getting the PX24's. This advice I'm giving is coming from someone who plays a lot of different types of games, I don't need to specifically hear footsteps, I want good low rumbling bass and want to hear the heaviness of a gunshot or engine. Don't bother with the expensive surround headphones, they are all hyped. Most people review these and rave about them because they've never owned any other type of pair or compared them to several headphones. They don't know any better.

My wife was laughing while I was testing the 500's because I kept yelling, ""HOW DOES A $40 X12 Headset beat a $100 7.1 surround set??"" It was frustrating because I wanted the 500s to work but for now on I'm sticking to the cheaper ones and getting better sound. Side note, I just bought No Man's Sky and used that game and Just Cause 3 to test the sound on the headphones. The 500's drowned out the phasers and engines. I ended up skipping the surround sound altogether and sticking with the 'Bass & Tremble' setting... WHICH IS essentially the X12's and Px24's.  I also threw in GTAV and Metal Gear Solid V.  Same results.

Also, just to point out, the Gold Wireless lacked any bass whatsoever.  I was shocked but then discovered that the reason for no bass is the reason the 500's sucked...  It dulls / plays down a lot of atmospheric / environmental sounds including gun shots, etc...  This is to give the playing a major edge in FPS so they can hear footsteps, clips reloading, etc.  ONE more time, if you aren't a FPS fanatic and don't care if you hear footsteps coming up behind you, get cheaper amplified headphones.  Even with the X12's I could get somewhat surround but it keeps all the sounds at a full level and balanced.  Just frusturuing because most reviewers don't know this and take it for what it's worth.","I've owned the x12's, PS Gold's and the 500p's.  Ended up going back to the X12's.

I'd never played games with similiar control schemes like the Resident Evil games myself so I'm not used to the choppy control style and the lack of platforming (no jumping period). The cinematics were wonderful and dramatic. Whoever designed the visuals deserves a raise, but I HATE the controls. The worst thing about the control is that manuevering is a 2 step process instead of a more intuitive and efficient 1 step process.

For example, let's say you want your character to walk to the right. You must FIRST rotate him in the direction you want to go THEN press forward on the directional pad (this ain't an FPS). He rotates way too slow. They try and compensate for this by using another button to pull off a quick 180 turn, also your character will often automatically face the next enemy the AI thinks you will want to strike. When you're surrounded by three enemies, your disadvantage is compounded. Some may say this is challenging, I just call it what it is, crappy play control. Also, the fact that you can simply just tap the attack button and watch your character slice several enemies in sequence without doing anything else is not a plus in my book. I want a game that actually requires me to play it, not tap a button mindlessly. I think this exemplifies the meaning of the term ""button mashing"".

If you want an action packed and cinematically impressive hack-'em-up I highly recommend ""God of War"".

If Saboteur was going to steal things from other games make them better or at least similar.  My pet-peeve would be the climbing aspect of the game.  When you climb you have to press the X button, not press and hold, but press the button over and over again until you reach the top.  That's just annoying.

I climbed on the certain locations on the bridge to plant explosives, but I couldn't.  There wasn't any shadowy like explosive to indicate that I put it on the correct location.  In fact it did do anything.  I basically had to give up.

Forgive me, it's not un-polished... it's UNFINISHED!  Certain things on the game makes no sense.  Like the size of the steps on the big cannons during Mr. Wong's missions.  Also, the character can get stuck when he is in a small gap.

Your walking down a street.

You check your weapons before going to the gun dealer.  You have full ammo for the two rifles you can carry and enough grenades, dynomite and timed explosives for any mission.  You look up and see a Nazi guard tower.  You decide not to plant a bomb up there since you tired of climbing and their seems to be a lot of balconies that would make this climb a hassle.  You want to drive, even though the driving is a bit annoying, but what can you expect its the 1940s.  You get attacked and fail.  You want to re-start the game again, but your given a choice, load a game save or head back to HQ.  Both option reveals the you will lose all of the money and weapons.

Nintendo. It was a side scroller, so
I saw Samus (the character you control)
from afar, and I actually
believed Samus was a robot, not a woman in an armour.
Metroid was fun, because you got to run around in several
worlds with different environments, get new guns, shoot down
scary monsters, and you got to play
around with the thought ""I wonder what it's like for Samus
to stand on that platform right now. Isn't he (she) afraid of heights?
What is it like to look at this world through Samus's eyes?""
So several years later later Metroid Prime enters the scene,
and my last question was answered: Technology has made it
possible to now see the environment through Samus's eyes,
and we have video sequences now that clearly state that Samus is a
woman.
I always thought that it was I who was getting older, since
games fascinated me less and less. But maybe, it was the games
themselves. Metroid Prime is dull. The game leaves nothing
to the imagination like the first Metroid games.
Everything you see (through Samus), is what you get. What was
fun with Metroid was that when you jumped and missed a platform
you would get a stomach sensation as if falling. Why?
Because your concentration was entirely on making that jump.
In Metroid Prime you just know you missed the jump, because
you just fell down, no way of knowing where your feet are,
or where to place them to make the jump.
So I guess that's my point about Metroid Prime. Mario made it to 3D,
not Castlevania, and I guess not Metroid either. Give the player
some limitations, and see the player make up for it in imagination:
When the mind is communicating with the game, see the game thrive.
In Metroid Prime, the player has everything she or he needs,
no imagination required.. So the game feels more like a chore,
than a game. Make a stand for 2D and bring Metroid back to its
original place. Maybe I'll just buy a gameboy advance, just
to finally make that jump.",Better in 2D,1082332800,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I do think it was a bit tougher (or maybe I just wasn't making good use of the bonuses) than the original Cradle of Rome. I say that because as I recall I got to level 50 or so in Cradle of Rome before I started having to replay levels due to failing/running out of time. In Cradle of Rome 2, I started having trouble around level 35. Like I say, I may have just made bad choices about using the bonuses, but for whatever reason, I ending up playing most of the levels from 35 on more than once.

On the plus side, having to replay a bunch of levels does extend the gameplay!

N,"After Mega Man X4 debuted for the PSX back in 1997 (well, there is a Sega Saturn version too, haha), I though I had played the best installment the X series had to offer.  So when the sequel came out, a mere two to three years later in 2000, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the game only delivered an above average experence.

Gameplay wise, all the elements that make up a Mega Man game are present: select a stage, beat boss, gain weapon, take on the next boss, rinse, lather, and repeat. While this is all well and good, and what us Mega Man fans crave, X5 includes is share of problems. Most of the boss enemies are extreme pushovers, as most don't even require any specific strategy, hence you don't even really need to use the weapon they are weak against. Add to this fact Zero can almost crush the entire game with a single attack makes for somewhat shallow gameplay. The boss enemies also have really dumb names (if you know your music you'll realize each Maverick takes its name from the original members once-great band Guns 'n' Roses). Why Capcom ditched the tired and true ""ability-animal"" names and went with this stupid band member theme is beyond me.

X5's story is the game's highlight. Still I don't know why Capcom didn't choose make use of FMV's like in X4 to tell the story (obviously money was an issue here). Instead we get lame still shots and text telling the story. As far as X5's story climbs, there are some serious holes that hold it back. Add to this that Mega Man X6 ends up ruining any successful, logical, and believable continuation of X5's story, and you realize things are not so well in Mega Man land...

Overall, X5 is good game and a worthy addition to the series. Still, the fact that this game marks the point where Capcom got sloppy with the series will ultimately put Mega Man X5 near the end of most Mega Man fan favorite games lists.",The beginning of the end for the X series...,1108598400,,,

3.0,True,"05 1, 2016",A1G7SBE1W49DNS,B00ZRZTT3W,BRIAN SOLOW,"My review of Star Fox Zero & Guard

Part 1 Star Fox Zero

Pros

Fast pace arcade feel - Thanks to Platinum Games the game not only retains its arcade feel to but also has Platinum style in as being a fast pace action game.

Good Amiibo support - Like last year Mario Maker you do have the ability to unlock new arwings (the Black and the Retro Awring) in Star Fox Zero however if for some reason you don't have the Falco or Fox Amiibo don't worry you can still unlock them the old fashion way (by collecting 70 medals in the game)

Love the new vehicles - Beside returning vehicles like the Landmaster (which control better then it did in Star Fox Assault) 2 new vehicles are added. I love the new Walker and would love to see it be used in future Star Fox games and I did enjoyed using the Gyrowing (which I found easy to use despite the odd control scheme in Star Fox Zero).

its playable - Probably the most controversial part of Star Fox Zero is the controls. However there are way to make the experience better. By have the motion control come on only when you tap the fire button (ZR) and pressing the select button to switch to cockpit I found it to help make the game more enjoyable (at least that how I see it)

Cons

Little to no replay value - Outside of collect medals (That unlock challenge mission) and unlocking the sound tests there really isn't much to do. No online leaderboard (You can post your high score on miiverse but that it) or any form of multiplayer (offline or online)

The Controls - As I said early Star Fox Zero is playable but not easy to used thanks to Nintendo decision to force the motion controls and the screen on the gamepad. This make playing Star Fox Zero very difficult and there are times you will get frustrated with the controls. It would have been nice if Nintendo had at least give us a traditional control scheme for those who don't want to used the motion control or the 2nd screen. I feel as though Nintendo was so desperate for the gamepad to be used for something in Star Fox Zero (Then again Nintendo really didn't do a good job selling the gamepad in the first place).

Part 2 Star Fox Guard

Pro

Good uses of the Gamepad - Unlike Star Fox Zero Star Fox Guard actually used the gamepad the right way (like Mario Maker did). Basically you tap (or move before or during battle) on the camera on the gamepad and you move the camera with the right analog stick and shoot with fire button (ZR). The TV screen act as your security camera while the gamepad screen act as your map to show where the enemies are.

Very Challenging - While the game starts off a bit easy the difficultly does pick up in later levels which to me is a good thing plus with different types of enemies (and different of cameras to used) the game encourages to take different approach to defeat certain enemies.

Fun online multiplayer - Similar to Mario Maker the game lets your make your own maps (or your own robot army) and challenging others players online.

Cons

Ok amiibo used - While not exactly bad the amilbo support isn't great either. Basically you used scan the Fox & Falco amiibo before each mission and and during each mission you can call in a squard of arwings to help you. Its ok but I do wish there was an option where you can used the metal (in currency) to call in a arwing air strike rather then having to scan the amiibo every time. Plus the feature can only be use once a day and cant be uses in certain mission.

Overall - Star Fox Zero for me is a mix bag for me. On one hand the game is a return to what make Star Fox 64 a great game. On the other hand the decision to force motion control and the gamepad does hold the game back from what could have been the best Star Fox game since Star Fox 64. Star Fox Guard on the other hand is a good game. Its just a shame that a game like Guard is being release around the time the WIIU (and I know not everyone will agree with me on this) is pretty much dead.",A good game held back by questionable controls,1462060800,,,

Sure, I think some games are violent and gruesome, like the original Manhunt, but that's why it has a mature rating.  The game experience is very bland and any sense of adventure becomes plagued by so-so graphics and somewhat boring characters.  The objectives seem all too passive and the back-story altogether generic.  I don't think the sequel was made by the same folks behind the original, because it just doesn't have the same feel to it.  When I first played Manhunt, I was actually nervous for my character.  And it was a challenge not to get caught and killed by the maniacs faced.

The crucial gimmick is that you can write in any object (not quite any, but out of a vocabulary of thousands and thousands of words) to make that object appear in the game.  The game presents puzzles and obstacles, and challenges the player's imagination to add whatever tools it takes to get through.  It's amazing.  Among the words I tried were mech, suspension bridge, snow, jet pack, grappling hook, shovel, dog, rail gun, velociraptor, shrink ray, invisibility cape, flood, tornado, unicorn, assassin, truck driver, submarine, scuba gear, and fire, just to name a few.  It's an amazing idea for a game.  I didn't have too much trouble encounter words or terms the game doesn't have, but it's vocabulary is huge and imaginative.  And it can be used to overcome over 200 levels.

That's the genius side of the game.  Unfortunately, that's not all there is.  The chief problem is control. The same control is used to move your character as to manipulate all the stuff you write in.  And it's never very precise.  The result is often selecting an object when you want to move, or moving when you want to select an object, or getting the that right but not being able to move to the spot you want.  This proves to be quite annoying.  The game has some other minor flaws (the most important to was that I like stories and the game has none; it's just puzzles, which was disappointing to me at least) but none that interfere the fun as much as the controls. It's also perplexing sometimes how, despite all the objects the designers got right, there are some that just don't seem to work in a way that makes sense, which can be annoying when you've come up with a clever idea only to find out object X doesn't work like that.

Starting with the positives, I love the design of these, they LOOK cool as hell.

- Car customization is just right. There are enough upgrades, both performance and visual, to spend hours pimping your ride.

The Bad:
- Maybe I'm in the minority, but I hate having to drive around to find races. This isn't GTA, I just want to race. It is a real pain having to track down the race you want, flash your brights, etc.  Sure it may seem more realistic, but again this isn't GTA.

Conversations that plod along, endless elevator rides, running around trying to find bits and pieces.  I was expecting an FPS with a strong story and ended up mostly bored.

But the biggest nit?  Not being able to save during combat.  A couple of the battles were tough and I hated making it most of the way through only to have to start all over again.  And the final battle against the Big Boss was impossible.  I've only ever used cheats on 2 games and this was one of them.  I had to give myself the SuperGun to kill the guy.

It was supposed to allow you to experience the role of an utterly powerful Jedi/Sith like no other game. And it does, sort of. Overall the game does a pretty good job of maintaining the illusion of being a super powered bad dude. But its the minor imperfections, and there are a lot, that drag it back down towards mediocrity.

As an adventuring game with a large amount of platforming the camera gives me a large amount of trouble. There are situations where it will fix in place and make maneuvering very difficult. It will also occasionally cause you to miss landings and fall to your death. There are also a large amount of spaces that you would think you are able to maneuver your character to, only to learn they aren't part of the stage as you fall to your death. Without good camera control you aren't able to ever get a good look at these areas before you commit.

The combat can be fun, but suffers from very poor targeting. There are so many times you try to scoop up an enemy only to have your target change. So you lift a rock as a droid pummels you. And for being a guy with a light saber there are a huge amount of enemies equipped to fight against you. You would think that after watching the movies you should be able to cut a bloody swath through most of your enemies. But not so. It turns out a large amount of things you face in combat just happen to be lightsaber resistant. Which manages to kill the fantasy a bit. There is nothing like being unable to get past the guard of a bug creature because he claw can't be cut. You would think everyone in the Empire fights lightsaber wielding Jedi everyday. For finishing the tougher enemies there is also a button sequence you will have to go through. I often find myself hoses as I go from madly attacking directly into the sequence with no warning. Which causes my poor guy a world of pain until I get on the right page. It also distracts from the action on screen. The boss fight sequences are some of the best of the whole game and its easy to be caught up watching the action and miss hitting the right button.

I experienced a number of glitches during my playthroughs as well. I managed to get stuck in walls several times. And there were a few stages I wasn't able to force manipulate items needed to complete the stage. For the latter issues I was forced to quit my game and load it again to sort out the issue. Not too bad but with the poor save system it could mean playing through the entire stage again.

Overall I did enjoy my time with Force Unleashed and will probably take a couple more play troughs. But being this game is already short I would recommend it as a rental most people.

3.0,False,"11 1, 2008",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0016BVY7U,Aiex Halo,"This is precisely the sort of sequel expected from the Red Alert franchise.

First I should say that I read early regarding development, and heard that the game would ""play up the silliness"" in design.

That immediately turned me off from it, as Red Alert was so blunt, unpolished, bleak, and gritty as to be a frightening game for its time with the mix of a shockingly realistic Joseph Stalin in cutscenes, and a seemingly brutal AI in a game that never allowed for cheating or difficulty adjustment beyond that at the start of the campaign.

Red Alert 2, in comparison, upped the ""silliness"" to a point of complete cheeseballs, and was a huge disappointment to many fans.

At the very least, stupid cartoonyness aside, I thought Red Alert 2 was great.

And so Red Alert 3 manages not to go overboard with playing up the ""silliness"", but it does come off as a cartoony sort of game in Red Alert 2 style.  The video cutscenes are of course sharp and beautifully acted, and while at first I was disappointed in the choice of well-known actors (Tim Curry in particular), I've found that they produce some of the best characters for the game.

Tim Curry is the first believable Russian Premier of the series, holding little of the terrifying dread of Joseph Stalin, or the Russian-style ""engrish"" and goofball antics of Alexei Romanov in Red Alert 2, but making his own Russian Premier, a clear-cut and defined character who could be a legitimately real person.  George Takei has clear authority and gravitas as the Emperor, and his grand declaration on the Russians of Japan's divine mandate to conquer is overwhelming.

The gameplay itself is nothing really special, something much of the same sorts as seen in Command and Conquer Generals (I haven't played C&C 3 so I can't judge there), with a vast improvement in graphics since Generals, but still a sense of slower-moving action (not just from graphics overload).

The gameplay as well is very much a balanced sort of cartoonishness which at one moment even managed to convince me that it was normal to see Russian conscripts marching alongside a trained scout bear and a series of tanks that walk like spiders (Soviet Stingrays) to attack Japanese samurai with lightsaber-like swords.

While the game itself is terribly average, and barely an improvement from Command & Conquer: Generals, the mere presentation of it---the menu design, the epic soundtrack by Frank Klepacki, the cutscenes and acting---manage to hook me and keep me wanting to hear and see more in between each mission.

UPDATE: Storyline.

I won't post any spoilers and any details on it save for one.

Like I mentioned on an ignored discussion page here, the game brings up a highly interesting plot element involving Dr. Zelinski contacting the player in all three campaigns, mentioning the Soviet Premier having travelled back in time to change the future/present.  In the Soviet campaign, he randomly disappears for no reason after telling you this.  In the Allied campaign, no one cares except when he tells them about a Soviet base on Cuba.  Only in the Japanese campaign does anyone seem to care about what Zelinski is saying, and by the end it doesn't even matter anymore.

Zelinski's message involves a supposed 'break-down' of the time-space continuum.  And yet after all the campaigns, not only is this idea not expanded on in the least, it is practically completely ignored.  If anyone remembers Yuri's Revenge, a 'break-down' of the time-space continuum caused by Einstein lead to a ""merging"" of the two timelines, causing Yuri to be destroyed and General Carville to come back to life in the ""true"" timeline.

Another highly interesting plot point completely ignored is Yuriko.  Absolutely no backstory is provided on her, nor is she given a FMV actor to portray her.  There is a clear distinction between her, Yuriko the Japanese Psychic in Red Alert 3, and Yuri the Soviet Psychic in Red Alert 2, and yet this is not explored in the least in Red Alert 3.  The storyline, while on its own interesting, is a colossal disappointment in context with Red Alert and Red Alert 2.

Solidly 3/5, perhaps at best 3.5/5.

Or lukewarm. It just doesn't taste the same, despite consisting of all the same ingredients. Which brings me to ""Bioshock 2."" I loved the original. It was one of the greatest, most original and atmospheric games ever released. It may have been the spiritual successor of the equally amazing ""System Shock"" series, but it was entirely its own thing. As for its sequel, well... I liked Neil Marshall's horror flick ""Descent"" too, but that didn't mean they should have made ""Descent Part II,"" a pointless, unoriginal retread that had very little new to offer, and what was new wasn't very good and reflected negatively on the original. I feel exactly the same way about ""Bioshock 2.""

I never saw the need for a sequel to begin with, in all honesty, as the first ""Bioshock"" wrapped itself up quite well. Now, ""Bioshock Infinite"" is in the works, almost acknowledging that a straight ""Bioshock"" sequel was always a bad idea in much the same way as the ""Prince of Persia"" franchise decided to go back to what worked with ""The Forgotten Sands"" after that next-gen reboot that might as well have played itself. Granted, ""Infinite"" is trading an underwater city for a flying city (very imaginative), but it's DIFFERENT. It has the potential to do what ""Bioshock"" did the first time around -- take what we love about that game but make it fresh again. Basically, everything that, I feel, ""Bioshock 2"" failed to do.

In ""Bioshock 2,"" you get to play as a Big Daddy out to rescue his abducted Little Sister, and that's about as far as the game goes toward forging its own identity. You still tool around in Rapture, which looks almost exactly the same as it did when you last left it. You still scavange everything you can find while squaring off with those Adam-addicted freaks. The gameplay is identical in almost every way, but with one difference -- we've already done this, and there's no compelling reason to do it again when you could just as easily pop your far superior copy of the original ""Bioshock"" in and give it another playthrough. Even the game's most tauted feature, playing as a Big Daddy, is weakly executed. You feel every bit as fragile as you did in the first game, and aside from your armored hands filling the screen, it's hard to tell you're not the same protagonist from game one except for the fact that you can now march around with a Little Sister riding on your shoulder and directing you toward the next source of Adam.

I think critics put on the kiddie gloves when this game stepped into the ring earlier this year. My admiration for the first ""Bioshock"" doesn't cloud my judgment though when it concerns the sequel -- in fact, quite the opposite. The overwhelming feeling of sameness just kept creeping in on me during my time with ""Bioshock 2,"" like I'd done all of this before only better. The first game's story was far superior on top of it -- especially the ""Would you kindly?"" revelation near the end, perhaps gaming's best ever ""Gotcha!"" moment. There are no such moments here, although the chance to see things from an entirely different and very eerie perspective near the game's conclusion is certainly the best moment in ""Bioshock 2."" But it can't hold a candle to learning the truth about your supposed benefactor in the original game.

And that's the problem. There's just not enough that's new here, and what is new just can't compete with what came before. Even the whole playing as a Big Daddy angle, were it executed better, still wouldn't be all that fresh since something similar essentially happens at the end of the first game. Basically, there are two camps of people who ""Bioshock 2"" is for -- those who missed the first one (Why?!), and those who played the first one several times and still can't get their fill of Rapture. On those grounds, this glorified expansion pack is certainly worth its weight in gold. But if you loved the first game, and let's face it you probably did, but expected much more out of a proper sequel, you'll probably be just as disappointed by this return to Rapture as I was. This makes it a hard game for me to actually score, but let me put it this way -- I was playing this and ""Metro 2033"" at around the same time, and constantly found myself being wooed away to the mutant-haunted tunnels of Moscow and turning my back on the undersea mess that was Andrew Ryan's supposed utopia...",It sinks...,1306800000,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around. Thankfully Blue Shift comes with the previous expansion Opposing Force.

Blue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.

The gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominos.

The negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.

There are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.

In all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game.

After a while, especially in levels 17 to 20, Dr. Mario becomes a pointless game. It just goes on and on to no end. The most unbelievable challenge is levels 18 through 20 at high speed which I found them just inhumane and robotic because I thought the game was for kids? That's just plain stupid. All in all, Dr. Mario is fun for a while and then not so fun anymore when it gets serious. Below are the strategies in how to beat the game. Check my youtube videos per stage by typing in ""Mr. Math Expert Dr. Mario,"" so you can see what I mean. I have a record of beating levels 17 to 20 at high speed.

1-15: Nothing to say. Just too easy.

16-18: The game is getting more difficult, and level 18 is the beginning of the nightmare. The speed is insane and makes the game too hard to beat. It took me a lot of tries to beat it. What level 18 requires is 10 to 15 minutes of absolute focus. If you let your mind wander for at least one second, game over. You can't depend on luck either.

19: For a while, I never thought I could beat level 19 at high speed (Okay, you understand me? high speed), but I did it. How to do it is to restart the game, pick level 19 with high speed as it will randomly generate a puzzle, test it and see if it looks feasible to solve it, and decide to stick with it or not. In my opinion, given the output of the pills, some puzzles are unsolvable. So, just keep flipping through until one can be solved with the favorable pill output. Watching the video of myself beating level 19 gives me a headache. It's safe to say that I'll never beat this one ever again. This one requires 100% focus and determination.

20: Again, I never thought I could beat level 20 at high speed (Okay, you understand me? high speed), but I did it. How to do it is to restart the game, pick level 20 with high speed as it will randomly generate a puzzle, test it and see if it looks feasible to solve it, and decide to stick with it or not. In my opinion, given the output of the pills, some puzzles are unsolvable. So, just keep flipping through until one can be solved with the favorable pill output. Level 20 consitutes the end of the game for you. If you beat level 0 to 20 at high speed, you won. Move on. The levels beyond 20 are just insane and not worth bothering about. Watching the video of myself beating level 20 also gives me a headache. It's safe to say that I'll never beat this one ever again. This one requires 100% focus and determination.

Yes, Killzone 2 looks amazing, probably one of the best looking games of the generation (even 3 years later). Killzone 2 definitely goes for the ""cinematic"" philosophy of design, and it sure is nice to look at because of it.

Unfortunately it seems that Guerrilla utilized all there talent in this single department, as nothing else about the game really stands out from the immense crowd that is the modern shooter. The premise is ridiculous from the get go: you play space marines who fight space nazis. This may not have been such a bad thing had the game not taken itself so seriously. But both space marines and nazis have been played out so much in modern shooters that their combination results in a feeling of staleness rather than potential freshness.

What makes even less sense is the contemporary weapon set given to the players, which doesn't fit the space or the nazi themes. There isn't any creativity going on here in the weapons department, aside from a single gun you get later in the game that isn't really all that unique anyways. This is where the game could have really shined, but instead we get the usual assortments of assault rifles, smgs, shot gun, sniper, etc. Nothing you haven't seen before if you've ever played a shooter in the past 10 years.

Another curiosity is that even though the game takes place on another planet, most of the time you'll be shooting it out in urban/industrial environments. You know, the same ones that EVERY SHOOTER EVER has taken place in. Sure, they're rendered better than any game before, but there's still no creativity here. Killzone 2 disappointingly takes no liberties with the potentially exotic setting. After you beat the game, there will be very few set-pieces that will stick out in your mind, because they all feel bland; just another brown or grey urban/industrial level...

That's not to say that Killzone 2 is a bad game, because it's not. Everything on display is pretty much perfect. The game is great to look at, tight to control, enemy AI is great, guns are satisfying to shoot... But absolutely nothing on display here can't be found in almost any other shooter released in recent memory. Nothing at all sets this game apart from the pack. It's simply an old shoe that's been polished so much that there's hardly any leather left. If you're still new to the genre or you just need a mindless ""popcorn"" game to pass the time, Killzone 2 is definitely worth checking out.

While the strategy here is not as complicated or in-depth as say, Final Fantasy Tactics, it is fun and engaging to play. The only real problem with the strategy is that because of how the leveling up system works, character choices in the context of skills become less and less relevant as the game goes on. What I mean by this is that at the beginning of the game there are far more skills than points that you have to buy with them. But as the game goes on you end up getting enough points to buy basically everything that is possible. What this means is that for both you and your opponents the uniqueness of your character disappears because by the end of the game every character already has so many of the same skills. This problem could have easily been taken care of by reducing the number of average points throughout the game, or at least during the second half. This is a significant balancing flaw that should not have been overlooked.

As for the rest of the game, there simply isn't much there.  The videos are boring, the voices are mundane, and the plot is paper-thin. Microsoft seemed to put its heart into the strategy portions of this game and skimped on everything else.

All in all this is a great game if you love turn-based strategy and a not-so-great game if you don't.

-mods are available
-great variety of vehicles to play with
-very challenging on extreme
-easily 200 hours of gameplay for OCD completion freaks
-hilarious amalgam of famous dictators (Mao, Marcos, Baby Doc Duvalier, Kim Il Jung, etc.)

The bad
-PC bugs
-irritating and time wasting game mechanics

Bugs and basic game mechanics make this game a little irritating to play.  Little things like having your black market weapons/vehicle purchases disappear if you die or exit the game.  Having manual saves put you back at checkpoints.  And there are a couple of bugs on the PC game.  The one that really sucked was when you are sent to blow up an offshore oil rig.  If you attack it and destroy more than 15% but less than 85% and then die, you will not be able to finish the mission.  That's because when you start up again, the program doesn't register what you've already destroyed in your fist attempt when you blow it up again.  And you need to get to 85% to finish the level.  So if you blew up 30% of the targets in life 1, your maximum possible score in life 2 is 70%.  It took me a while to figure this out, and I wasn't the only one.  To fix this you have to completely exit the game, and then restart it and that will reset the damage meter.

This game really could have used more dev time (although what game doesn't?).  Refining the game mechanics and eliminating the bugs would have made this a easily a 4 star game.

Other thoughts: My favourite two mods were playing as Kane (the hot helicopter pilot) instead of the grizzled dude, which made the game easier on the eyes.  And there is a program that loads your save files and then displays what and where you are missing on a high rez map.","Good, but Irritating game",1289692800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

First, level design must not be confusing.  Use of different textures can help make rooms look different, and doors shouldn't have anything sticking out to catch you when you're backing up.  Lighting should not confuse the player eithers.  Too many effects can be really confusing.  The single player mode should have a story worth paying attention to or none at all.  Events should make sense like they would in the real world.

  The designers of Halo 2 must not have played many first person shooters.  I'll tell you why:

  The level design makes no sense at all.  No one would ever make structures like the ones in this game.  There is just no logic to it.  Almost all of the doors have little pieces of wall jutting out into them making backing up through them frustrating.  There are also tons of rocks, trees, broken cement, and other props that bring up the polygon count.  High polygon count in an xbox game makes for low framerates.  The textures are not very creative.  All the rooms look very similar, and the lighting effects are unrealistic and confusing.  When you shoot or get shot, there is enough flashing on the screen to send someone into a seizure.  Xbox live does not allow you to configure much, and the levels of the menus are confusing.  The single player story leaves a lot to be desired and the weapons are not balanced anymore.  The energy sword is friggen cool though! Remember how well balanced they were in Halo 1?

  First person shooters have been around for many years.  Most of the mistakes Halo 2 is guilty of have been made before.  If only the programmers played more video games.

  Halo 2 is not all bad, but it is not very good either.  Considering how fun the first Halo is (for a console game), this could have been ten times better.  Maybe Halo 3 won't disappoint...

I think Atari's Test Drive Unlimited is more involved, more open, larger, has more to do. EA's Burnout series is more fun. Those really aren't racing ""sims"" (in TDU the sim is actually the island, not the racing) but they're racers, so a comparison can be made. I suppose a better comparison is versus PGR and Forza. While I'm not sure that DiRT is any better than Forza2, it might be a bit better than PGR3, but PGR3 is a much older title so a better comparison might be when PGR4 arrives soon.

Criticisms:

- It is pretty, but I found some graphics issues I haven't found in other racers or other games. I can only call them ""refresh"" problems as I'm not sure what the actual problem is (I can only describe it as a visible squiggly translucent line coming down from near the top of the screen toward the bottom that looks like the frame rate or screen is refresh)...Again, if this is my 360, my 1080p HDTV, or the cables, it doesn't appear on other games, and I have tons of them.

- Any racer can be utterly frustrating. You drive for several minutes and right when you get toward the end, something goes wrong, someone hits you, etc, and you lose the race. It might take you awhile to learn to use the ""reset vehicle"" in this game to combat this (which feels like cheating).

- The gigantic career mode pyramid gives a false impression that these are all separate tracks. Many are reused.

- Extremely annoying co-pilot during rally races who shouts ""left 3, right 4, left 5, 100, blather blather"" (he sound like a quarterback before the ball is hiked) to try and tell you what's coming up. But these races go so fast that you're your brain will be switching back and forth within split seconds watching the race and looking at the map above to see where the next curves/turns will be, that also focusing on what this guy is saying is impossible or annoying. Is what he saying even accurate? Thankfully, you can turn this guy off in the options.

- It should be noted that ""DiRT"" implies off-road racing only. There are plenty of non-dirt tracks here.

- The ads show a lot of crashing, rolling and banging into other cars (because that looks like fun), but if you do that, you'll lose most of the time. Often, if you so much as gently touch another car, you spin off to the side while watching everyone else pass you. This isn't Burnout.

End Result: the combined press rankings are at 8.4 which is where Need for Speed Most Wanted ranks. I think that's a fair assessment. The critics rank Forza2 and PGR3 higher than DiRT with Need for Speed Carbon ranking much lower.

Look for Need for Speed ProStreet, PGR4 (with better dynamic weather effects), and especially the new Burnout: Paradise, with a more open world (like Test Drive Unlimited except you get to crash into `em).",Good racing sim; fair review,1187740800,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

However I downloaded the Ghostbusters demo from Xbox Live and I was entertained enough to rent it a few days later. While the game itself is pretty good, there are two major flaws that caused me to lose interest and turn the game off.

I have no issues with the visuals and sound, while it isn't anything that will win any awards, they are quite good. These days, I feel too much emphasis is put on visuals anyway and not enough in more important areas like game play. The controls themselves are smooth it is a bit complicated and since the rental did not come with a user's manual, I had to rely on the on screen instructions which don't do a very good job in fully explain EXACTLY what you are doing and why you are doing it. Of course if I actually had a manual to read from, then this probably wouldn't even be an issue.

From what I've seen so far, the storyline is done pretty well. You don't play as one of the original Ghost Busters, instead you play as a new recruit and you join the other four as you hunt down ghosts in various areas of the city. The voice acting is authentic and sounds like their real life counterparts, but for some inexplicable reason your character doesn't seem to have the ability to speak so I suppose he communicates with the others psychopathically. As you are playing, the game tells you how to do certain things, however as I stated before it does not fully explain why you are doing it as a manual would but eventually you should be able to catch on.

Even during the first level, the game started getting a little repetitive which is what I expected eventually, but this is not the main problem I have with this game. It didn't take long to realize that there are two major flaws in the game that just often times end up with me turning the game off. First of all there is so much going on with flying ghosts as well as ground monsters that appear behind you so it's hard to avoid damage; take too much damage and you will fall to ground hoping your teammates will revive you before you die. Most of the time they revive you quickly but sometime they will walk right by you and do nothing. You also will spend a lot of time reviving them, putting your self in danger due to the fact that most monsters attack from all directions.

Once you do die, you have the option of restarting from the previous checkpoint. Choose this option and you are forced to sit, wait, and wait some more through an extremely long loading screen. When the game finally does load, you will be more than likely disappointed to find out that you didn't apparently didn't kill enough ghosts or get far enough to start later in the level and you have to do everything all over again. This happens constantly during game play and it is extremely frustrating having to start all over again.

I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate having to something over and over and over again, and for games that use checkpoint systems, this is exactly what will eventually happen. I haven't gotten a gauge of how far the checkpoints are from each other, but even if they are relatively close, the long loading times cancel that out. After dying for the 5th or 6th time, I honestly got tired of having to start over from the beginning so I just turned the game off and watched TV.  I came back to it later on and progressed more into the game, but the checkpoint/loading problems will be a recurring problem in the game.

However that being said, the game is extremely fun to play its just too bad that the poor implementation in handling game saves and loading times take away from it.  It's definitely worth a rental, but until you can gauge your tolerance for the load times and incredibly stupid check point system, I can not recommend a purchase right out and certainly not for regular price that most all video games are going for these days.",Suprisingly fun with two major flaws.,1248220800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

Civilization Revolutions is designed to be a quick and light turn-based strategy game.  It aims to be a stripped down version of the PC smash hit ""Civilizations"".  It's an ambitious goal; how do you remove half a masterpiece, and will it be a great game (or at least a worthwhile game) if you do?  As tricky as this goal is, it can be done.  (See the board game Puerto Rico and it's stripped down version San Juan.)  Unfortunately, Civilization Revolutions misses the mark and strips away most of the fun, too.

It's difficult to pin down why this game fails.  Several of the simplifications seem like good ideas.  For example, in the original PC game, you had to painstakingly build roads by hand on every square where you wanted a road.  Now, you can simply buy a road between two cities in 1 turn and be done with it.  The courthouse makes a lot more sense.  It used to reduce corruption (at least in early Civ variants), but corruption has been eliminated and now a courthouse expands the usable territory for a given city.  Instead of allocating individual citizens to specific territory to harvest, you set an overarching tilt (e.g. more production, more science, more food, more cash, or a balance).  There's also an interesting element with ""great people"" who can join your civilization if you lure them with culture.  Despite these and many smaller improvements, it's just not a very fun game.

I wanted to like this game, and have played 3 games through to completion, but will now be putting it down.

This game is both harmed by and harms the name Civilization.  If it hadn't been linked to that excellent brand, and if it hadn't needed to be as close to Civilization as possible, it might have done better.  It's not awful, and I might play it again if I run out of other worthwhile games (unlikely).  Moreover, the designers are clearly ""cashing in"" or ""selling out"" on the Civilization brand by putting out a mediocre game with that name and charging a premium for it.  I will be more wary of purchasing the next Civilization product.  It might have felt like a better game at $20 rather than $30.

First off let me say, I've played every Resident Evil game on the major consoles and loved most all of them. This is NOT a Resident Evil game. Those familiar with the horror genre and the Resident Evil style of ""OH HOLY $***"" moments will not find any in this game.

Campaign:
I finished the Campaign in about 6 hours or so, and I have to say...it was pretty awful. The game is broken down into missions with each mission taking between 30-45 minutes to complete. One of the major flaws with these missions is the autosave feature. The game autosaves a few times during missions, but if you quit before the end of the mission, you are doomed to repeat the entire mission. I'll break down the campaign and it's elements into categories.

Controls: The controls to the game are actually pretty fluid. There's a little lacking in the aiming department and hit marker system though. It seems your laser sight likes to bounce around (literally not sway but bounce), Even when you have a direct headshot, some zombies brush dem hatas off and keep coming.

Story: The story mode is somewhat lacking. You're just sort of dropped into the game with an extremely brief introduction and small cut scenes in between each mission to give you the story. Also (without spoilers) there's a choice towards the end of the game that makes no sense if you know anything about the franchise.

AI: You may notice that most of your teammates wear helmets and I can assure you it's for good reason. The friendly AI in this game are about as smart as dog crap on a stick. They refuse to heal themselves or you and believe the best place to find cover is to hide between a group of enemies. They will run into the open and you will find yourself yelling at them over and over (much to the dismay of those in your household) to do something at least somewhat f'in useful.

Graphics: The graphics from this game (in my opinion) do not improve on RE5. After such a time frame to develop a ""new"" game, one would expect to at least polish the graphics.

Gameplay Elements:

Character Design:
The ""main characters"" for the game are pretty cool. While there is no story arc (or even real background) for the characters, each has unique abilities. Each is a separate class which determines their abilities, but does little else. Abilities are unlocked through buying them with XP,

Lupo is a leader and assault class which grants incendiary ammo, an infinite ammo for a times perk, and a superman perk (no damage for so many hits and increased weapon accuracy).

Spectre is a surveillance class which grants a threat scanner perk, a biothermal vision perk, and an ability to see through walls perk.

Vector is a recon class which grants the motion detector perk, the ability to copy the look of an enemy, and the ability to go invisible for a short time.

Bertha is a medic, this allows her to increase the accuracy and movement speed of herself or a teammate for a time, cure an infection of herself or a teammate, and to reduce the damage taken to herself or a teammate by 50%.

Four Eyes is a field scientist her perks allow her a chance to infect a soldier or turn an infected friendly, a pheromone vial to attract infected to a target, and the ability to control infected enemies.

Beltway is a demolitions expert which gives him a fragmentation mine, a timed sticky grenade, and a laser trip mine.

Infected Types:
Sadly this is another area the game is lacking. There is of course the normal zombies, the ""runners"", and the lickers return from past games.

Hunters are a new B.O.W. which look like the creature from the black lagoon has an affair with a large lizard, attempted an abortion, and the hunters are what resulted.

There are special types of B.O.W's (Tyrants and Nemesis included) but I won't ruin the rest of them on the off chance you actually play the game.

Multiplayer:
The multiplayer surprised me. When I began this review I had only played the single player campaign and was inclined to tell you all to ask for a refund for having to even think to rent such a horrid game. The multiplayer however is quite fun and does add an extra point or two to the overall score for the game.

Games Modes:

Team Attack: Deathmatch against a team of online players with extra infected AI thrown in to spice things up.

Biohazard: This is a kind of team based one flag type mode. There are random spawns for canisters of the g-virus, which you and your team must try to capture and return to your base. While you are attempting these, the opposing team is trying to do the same.

Heroes: This is an interesting spin on the Team Attack mode. One team plays as the traditional ""heroes"" of the gaming series, while the other team plays as the ""bad guys"" from Umbrella. Your goal is to wipe out the other team. If you die, you come back as a generic sort of ""protector"" for your team.

Survivor: This game type is a sort of ""team"" free-for-all. The goal is to rack up points by killing the opposing team and the infected. However, the twist is at the end of the match, an evac chopper (with limited seating) will land and the goal is to get you (and your team if you choose) out of the infected zone.

Overall: 5.5/10
This is not a Resident Evil game and should not be labeled as such. The campaign is lacking in so many areas. The game had the opportunity (and interesting features) to be great, but falls before it even leaves the starting line.

The games only saving grace is the multiplayer which while fun, does not make up for the $60 price tag on what amounts to little more than an expansion pack.

3.0,False,"11 27, 2006",A3KZUBM6S477EQ,B000F5IH2I,Darius Jackson,"So after reading all the reviews on Amazon, my desire to pitch in my two cents rose a few notches. For one thing, I'll start out off by saying I have spent an even 100 hours in this game - so it's safe to assume I'm not talkin' outta my butt here. Yes, I am that loser that spent the extra 40 hours battling all the marks (extra bosses) and defeated the ultimate boss in the game, Yiazmat - a boss with 50 million HP (and thats no typo!)

People are complaining about the story; which is understandable. The story is not for everyone - it has a very ""europeon"" feeling to it, with the old english dialouge and mid-evil setting - this could turn away fans that are deaf on FF7-10. However, I don't feel its the story so much that is the problem - its mainly the PACING of the story that presents the challange of character involvement, enemy involvement, and story presentation as a whole. The pacing of the game is such that you get ten minutes of story development, then two hours of running around and leveling up; then another ten minutes of story, followed by another two hours of running around and leveling up - so why is this a problem? Well, by the time the main events and plot twisting DO happen, you don't care anymore - all you care about is getting to level ""X"" so you can advance through the next dungeon easier - because the majority of the time you spend in this game is just that, hence the ""MMO feel"".

As for the *actual* story - I thought it was very satisfying. The ending in-game cutscenes are very good (judge Gabranth reminds me of Darth Vader) and the ending FMV sequence was touching, with all the characters showing a significant amount of emotion. Now, was it as emotional as 10? No. Original as 6? No. As attaching as 7? Not in my opinion. However, there *is* a real story to the game that couldv'e been an awesome story if paced well, and maybe expounded on alittle bit better.

So in the end, if your on the fence on whether or not to play FFXII, just know that its basically 5 hour ""storyline"" stretched out over a 40-50 hour ""game"" - yes, there is an actual story within it all, despite what other 1 star reviewers are saying - but the games main focus is on exploring, battling, boss hunting, esper collecting, and gaining loot for better weapons and armor; which is kind of sad because Final Fantasy used to be all about story with gameplay taking second seat, but the change of pace is welcomed to some fans, including myself. To me, the battling and exploring is immense in this game; the fun factor is worth 5 stars in my opinion - however, overall, as a whole - 3 stars, because the story did not present itself clearly, and paced itself very poorly - and its the story that matters in a final fantasy game.",An MMO that is offline... if that makes any sense.,1164585600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

When I bought the game, it came on 5 CDs with a little instruction sheet full of misleading information. You will have to install a program called ""Steam"" which will then allow you to register Half-Life 2 online - THIS IS MANDATORY, THE UNREGISTERED GAME WILL NOT WORK!!

  By the way, you have to first find the CD key, pick it out from all the other text that is printed near it then remember to register with steam correctly the first time...OR ELSE YOU ARE SCROOMED (Scr#@ed and Doomed at the same time). But don't worry, if you lock up the game you can always get a replacement CD key in 6 TO 8 WEEKS! I tried e-mailing Valve/Steam; A computer responded: ""The CD key is invalid.""

This remote shows ingenuity, but is not as impressive as one would think. It doesn't seem that the Wii Remote senses true 3d motion.

3.0,False,"01 28, 2003",A2CVM8XR973JOV,B00007KE6C,Dirty Ears K-Wal,"A week ago, I bought War of the Monsters, and today I have just beat it. That is to say, I have unlocked every single character, skin, level, and minigame, as well as having beaten the game with every character in ""Adventure"" mode. I've had a great deal of fun playing it, but now it seems like there's very little else for me to do, except maybe play through all the difficulty levels or see how long I can last in endurance, although there's little to motivate me to do so.
Graphics 4/5: Very sharp, detailed character models and skins.  The levels are equally detailed (and quite destructable).  I really loved the fact that most of the skins weren't just ""different colors"" of the original monsters (each monster has 4 skins, 2 of which need to be unlocked via tokens earned in fights), but actually unique from one another for the most part.
Music/Sound 3/5: I really loved this soundtrack, reminded me a lot of the old 50s monster movies which I always a big fan of. The sound, on the other hand, gets fairly repititive, though that's a given in most fighting games. I played the games mostly on a mono TV, so I can't comment on the stereo sound, but I imagine it to be pretty sweet.
Gameplay 3/5: Gameplay is on the surface incredibly simple - 2 buttons to attack, 1 to throw, and 1 to jump - but is a bit more complex than that for those willing to experiment. When I first started to play, it was nothing but random button mashing, but then I realized that there were actually *combos* in the game. A lot of these combos are real simple, though there are a lot I havn't found yet. For example, the average simple combo is around 3 attacks, but I've gotten some as high as 9 hits, and there's the chance that there are even higher ones.
The environments in the game, probably one of the biggest draws, are almost completely destructable. Anything you see you can most likely grab, throw, destroy, and/or pound into the face of your opponent. It may take a while, but it's possible to completely annihalate every building on a level, which is both a strategic advantage and disadvantage.
There are three single player modes of gameplay: Adventure, where you take a monster through a ""storyline"" of sorts (though its the same storyline for every monster, so it gets a bit dull); Free-For-All, the classic...err, free-for-all in which you can fight up to 3 computer controlled opponents; and Endurance mode, where you see how long you can last with just one life against an endless supply of opponents (but only one at a time).
Most of the fights in Adventure mode can be a little frustrating at first, especially those with more than one opponent (I spent ages on the level with the Insect monster and the Robot Gorilla, but spent even longer when I had to fight two dragons...), but as you develop your skills, it becomes like a second nature. That still doesn't mean you'll die a frustrating death, but at least it won't happen quite so often.
Multiplayer 2/5: Multiplayer modes are the aforementioned free-for-all; Elimination, which is like free-for-all except its only two players and when you die you pick another monster to play as; and three mini-games, which can be unlocked but are quite pointless.  If there had been more, maybe the mini-games would have been better, but with only three it's not really all that exciting.
The biggest drawback to multiplayer modes, however, is the fact you can only play with two players. With four players, multiplayer would be fantastic, and make War of the Monsters a great party game. However, with only two, it definately loses some of its appeal. I can understand why there's no online play (though it would have been really fun), but what's the explantion for no four player mode?
Replayability 2/5: Possibly the worst part about the game, which in the end is its downfall. When you first start the game, you have 2 skins for every monster, with 10 monsters, and a few levels. As you play through Adventure or Endurance mode, you'll earn Battle Tokens, which can be used to purchase more skins, 2 secret monsters (each with 3 skins you can unlock), 3 mini-games, and 4 secret levels.  This would be all fine and dandy if it weren't so easy to get tokens or if the prices of the unlocks were more expensive. Believe me, you can have most of the secrets unlocked within a few days of casual playing.
What's worse is that there weren't more monsters to play as. Yes, you get different skins for each monster which make them look totally different and great (check out the Electric Eye's 4th skin for a great example), but at the core they're the same monster. The two secret monsters make up for this, but I felt there really should have been an even 20 monsters alltogether, secret or not.
As far as unlocks, there should have been much more of them, or Incog should have made it a lot tougher to get them. Where's the fun in getting secret stuff if it's incredibly easy?
Overall 3/5: I'm a little biased because I just love games with senseless violence and destruction, and the fact it has giant monsters resembling all those favorites from the golden era of monster movies makes me love the premise of the game. But overall, I felt that there could have been more.

To deal with the latter issue first, obviously it isn't in terms of the market value for a 64 GB memory card. You can get a standard 64GB SD card for less than half the price you'll pay for this one. In a world where the price of memory is constantly shrinking to see Sony milk their exclusive memory cards for such an outrageous price is depressing to say the least. There is absolutely no benefit to using these over normal SD cards, except of course that the Vita doesn't take standard cards. As far as I know there are no generic Vita memory cards either so you have to buy them right from Sony.

As to the first question, it works about like you would expect from a memory card. It holds the data reliably and doesn't seem any slower when loading games off it. The one caveat for that is that Vita games run off cartridges are slowed substantially for reasons I can't understand. The games themselves run fine but the time it takes the game to load up (and sometimes save) are at least doubled, probably more like tripled. Aside from that it stores my fairly large game library quite well. 64GB isn't huge but when you're dealing with PSP/PS1 games it's more than enough to hold 60+ games. If you're planning to use it to download Vita games you're likely to run into memory problems, which is a serious flaw in a system that's geared for downloadable games, but the physical copies of games are cheaper anyway and take up next to no room on the Vita. If you don't plan on downloading any games you could easily run an entire library of physical games off a 4GB memory card with no problem.

So as to the question of whether to get this or not, it's really up to how bad you need the memory space. I mean, overpriced or not the question is more about how well you can survive off cheaper memory cards. I would barely have had enough room on a 32GB card so for me this was necessary. If you can survive off smaller cards then you should probably do so.","As a Product it's Fine, but the Price is Outrageous",1398556800,13,,

After that it's straight up hacking and slashing with a very restrictive magic system that in my opinion isn't even worth paying attention to.  You do earn various weapons as you progress through the game but they're more situational than anything, you will most likely pick a favorite and stick with it until you are forced to use another weapon for 2 seconds of its usefulness.  You can take missions for rewards, but guess what, they're just more of the same crap the story line presents you with and really aren't much more than a clever way to disguise level grinding.

3.0,False,"11 14, 2007",A4BA2SSCQ2W56,B000TTFLS8,David Smith,"first of all, i haven't played the single player yet.  i'm sure it's great, but i wanted to jump right in to what i always loved the COD series for - multiplayer.  at first, everything seemed to be wonderful about multiplayer, but before long the negatives started to show.

for one thing, these maps are way too small.  you will die.  you will die A LOT.  you will die A LOT as soon as you spawn.  yes, you will.  you will die, and die, and die.  you will die by getting shot through walls (allowed in this game).  i died once from being shot through a concrete block - not cool.  you will die from helicopters overhead that you can't see.  you will die from airplanes appearing instantaneously dropping bombs on you and your teammates (gee, this warfare must be modern for a plane to fly over and pinpoint bomb your location in 1 second).  and this will happen many times in one round.  these are the negatives you have to live with along with the positives of COD 4.

i have a big problem with that.  the thing that always made COD great was you had full control over your fate.  if you were skilled enough, you could stay alive forever.  COD 2 didn't even have artillery strikes, so you were in full control.  here?  not so much.  especially when you consider.... the GRENADES.  my god, the grenades.  they never end.  everyone gets one grenade, and you can even get 3 with a perk.  since they can be cooked now, you won't be able to avoid many of them, and you will have to dodge many more.  don't get me wrong - cooked grenades are overall a GOOD thing and far preferable to the retarded uncooked nades of COD 2, but this many grenades on maps this small is a BAD thing.  the ability to ""throw back"" grenades is mostly a crock - since most are cooked, you're almost certain to die trying to do that, so people don't even try it.  why didn't the designers think about this??

another weakness - no room for snipers.  in past COD games, plenty of people would snipe.  in COD 4?  hardly anyone, because it's not worth it.  it's far too hard to kill anyone with a single-shot sniper rifle - hit them in the chest, and they LIVE!  and guess what?  since there's no health meter, your shot just did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  hooray!  it's far too hard to get a headshot because you have to get a more precise headshot than past COD games, plus sprint is enabled so people just run around.

as if getting constantly naded, bombed and choppered weren't bad enough, there's also stun and flashbang grenades.  don't get me wrong - just like shooting through walls, it's very fun to DO TO OTHERS, but not so fun when it happens to you.  it's just another element of the game to make you feel like you're getting digitally raped!

i'm amazed the creators didn't make BIGGER MAPS, as many servers have up to 15 people per team!!!  one map in particular, ""shipment,"" is so tiny it's just absolutely unforgivable.

also - what the hell happened to capture the flag?????  now we get ""sabotage,"" which is cool, but quite hard to keep up with what the hell is going on.  every 2 seconds someone gets killed and drops the bomb - a voice announcer keeps telling you ""they set up the bomb"" or ""they dropped the bomb"" but everything moves so fast, it's impossible to keep up with.  that announcer needs to go!!!!!!  in addition, the target location changes every time, and you have to keep looking at your map to know where to go - this game totally revolves around following a map.  not very fun.

speaking of the map, the radar thing sucks.  the idea was that when a player gets 3 kills in a row, they can enable radar which shows their team the enemy's position on the map - this makes it a lot easier to kill because you know where everyone is.  this is a pretty good idea, except RADAR IS ALWAYS ENABLED, so how the hell can you call it a ""perk""?  it's one of those ideas that is good in theory, but bad in execution.  how realistic is a war where you know where every enemy is??  not very.

speaking of radar, there is a ""hardcore"" mode that some servers use that cuts out radar and your map, and your weapons display.  however, this is even more frustrating because it doesn't show you what weapons, grenades and special weapon you have.  what the hell??  that's not ""hardcore"" - that's stupid.

anyway COD 4 is overall a wonderful FPS game and one of the best ever created SO FAR...  yet still i've played COD 2 just to get away from all its frustrations.  i'm sure just like COD 2, they won't make any additional maps, so we're just stuck with the tiny maps, blowing each other to hell all over the place.  it's a great game - but it's sad it could have been so much better.  the custom designed weapons is a great feature, but unfortunately you can't design weapons while playing a game, and you only get 5 slots.  i would have liked an on-the-fly custom weapon design feature.

one more thing - if you like a particular game type, it's hard to find a server that only playes your game type.  many servers have a rotation of search and destroy (which i hate) and domination and sabotage (which i like).  there's no way to ""weed out"" these servers in the server browser.

also nightvision is ugly as hell and nobody uses it.  i don't know why they included that crap.  my final verdict:  play COD 4, but stay away from servers with more than around 7 people per team.",stupid design flaws drag down a potentially 5-star game,1194998400,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Sure, the gameplay and interface was solid, the Russian campaign was a nice escape from the norm, but overall, Call of Duty just didn't do anything revolutionary in the FPS genre. Just about everything in COD was done before by games like Medal of Honor and Battlefield 1942. Admittedly, COD did some of those things better.

As for this new expansion pack, it really is not that good. For one, the original COD could be beaten in about 10 hours. Not a very long game, by any current standards. And it's safe to say that expansion packs often (if not always) offer less gameplay time. So how did they remedy this? Easy. They cranked up the difficulty by having scripted bombs kill you if you stand in the wrong place for too long, or the wrong place at the wrong time. And worst of all, I literally saw Nazis SPAWN in front of me due some invisible spawn point. I kill one wave of Nazis and then ""Poof!"" Hitler magically warped some Nazi stormtroopers onto the battlefield, or something. Shortly after this feeble attempt to defend the chateau, I died.

I also want to point out that the COD games are trying to emphasis the fact that ""You are part of a Team"", like when you follow SGT Moody around. But the AI for my teammates is INSANE! My fellow soldiers walk right by Nazis and don't even realize what they've done! As a result, ""I"", me, personally, have to kill these Nazis that they've conveniently overlooked. Very very rarely has a fellow soldier taken out a Nazi troop for me when I'm reloading.

I tried to be patient with this game, but in the end I just couldn't deal with it. Maybe I could put up with the game, if it had some redeeming replay value (I didn't buy it for multiplayer, only singleplayer). But this game has little or none. You won't find secret areas, you won't find secret maps, you won't find secret weapons, and, let's face it, any of those elements would be a little out of place in a trying-to-be-historical WWII game anyway.

The game has many areas where the framerate will drop not only into the lower 20s, but maybe even lower. That's not to say the game is bad though. The Fallout games are always great and this is no exception. I will say it's not as...immersive as Fallout 3. The Mojave just doesn't interest me as much as the Capital Wasteland, but don't let that stop you from buying this version of the game. It includes all the DLC and extra content in one package, and is still cheaper than buying it all separately.

Honestly, I'd steer away from this port if you can. Otherwise, it's still perfectly playable. While the 360 version plays slightly better, it's not a big improvement, and if you have the PC to do so, you'll probably have a better time and less of an eyesore.

Three Stars - Tremendously popular when released, still good today

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" were a hot property back in the late 1980s.  They had spawned a successful comic book series, a television show, three feature length movies, and other related merchandise.  They were even featured in Pizza Hut advertisements.

So it was natural someone would feature them in a NES game.

Enter Ultra, a shadow company of Konami.  Ultra was a subsidary of Konami and created for the sole purpose of publishing more NES titles than Nintendo allowed a developer to publish in any given year.

There was already an arcade game as a four player beat'em up released in Japan when Ultra released TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  in North America.  Rather than do a port of that title, Ultra developed their own title.  The arcade port would be released as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II: The Arcade Game.  Although billed as a sequel, the port of the arcade title had nothing to do with the original NES game, and had much different gameplay.  Instead of four player, the NES TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  II had two player.  Otherwise the game as largely identical to the original arcade title.

The game proved very popular back in the day.  This video game would even appear in the 1989 NES commercial posing as a feature length Hollywood film called THE WIZARD. (Interestingly enough, Lucas (""I love the Power Glove.  It is so bad!"") is now a convicted felon due to sex crimes.)  It's great to hear Beau Bridges complain about the Technodrome!  It's even better to read Roger Ebert's review of THE WIZARD where he discusses the games as well.

The overall gamestyle is either top down perspective or sidescrolling, and this title uses both constantly and interchangeably, similar to ZELDA II, although there is more to do in the overworld perspective than ZELDA II..

The game features all four turtles as playable characters from the start.  You are able to switch out any turtle at any time (provided they are still alive and have energy).  Leonardo has medium range sword attacks.  Raphael has the worst attack range but has the very powerful attack.  Michelangelo has medium range and power but is the fastest turtle (and the best to use in the infamous water stage).  Donatello is by far the best turtle to use due to his attack range and power, almost making the other three turtles obsolete at best.

Like previous reviewers have noted, the game strangely lacks any major enemy characters from the franchise, which is a rather strange omission given the fact Konami was marketing this product and kids obsessed with the turtles.  For bosses, Bebop, Rockseady, Turtle Van, Blimp, the Technodrome, and Shredder are the only main characters from the franchise that make an appearance.  Where is Krang (my personal favorite), Leatherhead, the Rat King, Casey Jones, etc?  Nowhere to be found.

The game overall is short and brutal.  You only get three continues.  There are only six (long stages), but trust me, those stages will have you pulling your hair out at the end.  Although there have been complaints about the controls, they are not THAT bad.  The Angry Video Game Nerd has shown in his famous review of this title a spot where you must jump over a certain hole in the floor that you actually just run over.  That is the exception, though, not the rule.  Overall the play control is rather good.

Like several NES games, ""TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES "" features a stage notorious for its difficulty.  ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is rather infamous for the water stage where you must guide the turtles through an insanely challenging swimming level where you must disarm explosives before the bad guys blow up a dam. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  gives you 2:20 minutes to swim through this underwater labyrinth in an attempt to disarm the bombs. You must avoid water currents, electric beams, pink seaweed that is very difficult to avoid.  Other stages that are difficult are Stage Four, the spiked wall sequence, and the final boss.

The difficulty and the length of this game was in line with other titles and these features were rather common in that era.  Other famous difficult levels from the NES era are 8-3 from the original ""Adventure Island"", the ""Battletoads'"" racing level and snakes level, ""Ninja Gaidens"" 6-2 and beyond, and the Yellow Devil boss from the original ""Mega Man"".  The games were just hard as balls back then and short.  The length was due largely to the technology of the time

The reviewer who complained about the ending being ""the worst"" he has ever seen is rather laughable.  It is a NES game, after all.  Overall, the endings to NES titles were always rather lame.  As far as the ""worst"", I would probably nominate GHOST AND GOBLINS, because after beating the game, you discover you have literally been tricked by Satan (!), and the only way to see the ""true"" ending is to go back and beat the game a second time.  As that game is damn near impossible, this ending just adds insult too injury.  How Capcom ever got Satan past Nintedo's censors (who wanted all religious content removed from North American NES video games)  I guess we'll never know.  Shigeru Miyamoto's 1983 DEVIL WORLD even went unreleased in the United States due to the title.

For availability, obviously you can get the game used for your NES or emulate (which may be safer for your controller, as you can save state your way through the more difficult sections).  Nintendo also sanctioned the title's rerelease in the Wii's Virtual Console (the greatest invention in the history of mankind, if I do say so myself!), although TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES  is 600 points rather than the standard 500 points for NES titles due to licensing issues.

Although now in the twenty plus years the game has been out, it has become favorable to blast the game for its difficulty and other perceived offenses (largely due to the AVGN review), it helps to remember that TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sold over four million copies when first released, making it one of the most successful third party NES titles ever.  Nintendo Power gave this game their Game of the Year award in 1989 as well.

Much like ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was a tremendously popular game, and much of the hostility present toward the title in the present gaming culture was not present back in the late 1980s (though this is probably more true of ZELDA II than TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ).

Although difficult and sometimes frustrating, this is one of the great NES titles.  The video game website IGN rated this title as the 98th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.","Tremendously popular when released, still good today",1325980800,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo NES'},

The 360 offers two different versions of Xbox Live (XBL: which requires a broad band connection to play): Gold and Silver. Gold members pay a $50/year fee in order to play on-line as well as download new content as it becomes available on XBL. Silver members cannot play on-line; however, they are able to download new content, typically, a week after it has been released on XBL. XBL is pretty reliable, but it does have its occasional problems (no, you do not get refunded if problems persist).

The bad: Many consumers will find themselves meeting the so-called ""red-ring of death"" (RROD) which is three red rings showing up on the front of the console around the power button. The RROD requires the consumer to call customer support (1-800-4MYXBOX) in order to send the console into repairs. My suggestion is to pay for the warranty that comes with the 360 because it covers the system for 3 years. If you do send your 360 into repairs, typically, they will send you a refurbished 360. Then another popular issue arrives: Digital Rights Management (DRM). When you receive your new 360 you will no longer be able to play any thing you have bought and downloaded from XBL with your original console unless you are connected to the internet with the new console (note: when you send your 360 into repairs they tell you to keep your harddrive and face plate).",Best Console this Generation...so far.,1200355200,2,{'Edition:': ' Elite'},

So when BIS (the creator of Tonal) split from Codemasters and came out with its Armed Assault series I was all on board with it.  I loved ArmA & despite all the stupid AI problems I played the heck out of it; online too.  So naturally I couldn't wait for ArmA2 and bought it as soon as it came out.  I shelved it right after that and waited for some patches because it was so full of bugs and crashes I couldn't play it for more than 5 minutes.

Now, the version # is up to 1.08, and it still hardly runs past 15 minutes before crashing out.  It's either ""Out of Memory"" CTD, or just a plain old CTD for no reason (Win7).  I have tried everything; going back to Vista and every trick out there to make it work...nothing.

Perhaps BIS tried for too much in this release.  I really appreciated the new base building capability, and 'fast travel' features.  But it's just not worth all the headaches...to me.

Then Operation Arrowhead came out and based on the player reviews bought that one too.  I found OA to be much smoother and a much better running game, but it also doesn't have the base building feature.  I found it a considerably shorter and simpler single-player campaign, but of higher quality.

I would have rated ArmA2 a 1-star but you actually need it to run many of the community addon missions made for Operation Arrowhead.  And since OA is such a short game I found myself turning to the community addons very quicky.  Therefore, I recommend buying the 'Combined Operations' release since I believe it has both games and for much less money.  But buy it for the OA half or skip ArmA2 altogehter and just buy Operation Arrowhead if you don't plan to download any community addons.

Size Matters, on the PS2, is by far the worst of them all, no question in my mind.  The graphics are actually not as bad as everyone says they are.  I'm playing this on a 42"" LCD and it doesn't look terrible for a PSP port.  Not as good as the other R&C titles on the PS2, but it's not terrible.  I don't have a big problem with the controls either.  It plays almost exactly like all the other games...you can strafe, fire with O, swing and throw your ratchet around...it's all pretty much the same.

This is another one of those games that it breaks my heart a little to be critical of.  It reminded me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Too-Human/dp/B000R0SS3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Too Human</a>&nbsp;in that way: just game made with a lot of love and imagination that falls on its face from time to time.

Playing Nier can really be divided into two astonishgly different parts; the boring half and the fun half.

The beginning half of the game - and it truly is half, it's the first 8 to 12 hours depending on how many sidequests you do- is just dry as dust.  Gameplay wise, you're given one weapon type and you gradually gain some different magic types as you fight through waves of really repetitive enemies.  There's a great deal of button mashing going on and it takes a lot of will power to keep playing.  You do level up, but it's in such a general and casual way that you often don't know it's happening.  You can level up your weapons, but it's hardly worth the effort of farming the really boring enemies over and over.  There are some pretty awesome boss fights scattered about that can be challenging and stimulating, but it takes too long to get to them.  And the sidequest are just the worst ever.  Countless hours of 'bring me ten of these' and 'bring this over there and bring that back', most of which lack even the most basic of context to make you care.  The notable exception is the series with the lighthouse lady, which I recommend seeing through to the end.  But other than that?  Almost entirely skipable - the rewards for them aren't even interesting or improtant.

Also, Nier is the ugliest damn game in years.  If visuals are your thing, just skip it outright.  Locations are flat and texture less.  Rooms are blocky and repetitive.  Seriously, it's hideous.

So, all that happens...  But then we come to the very middle of the story.  There's a pretty epic boss fight, a dramatic turn around, and some character low points.  The story flashes forward five years, and suddenly the game is much better.

Little things have changed; two new weapon types are added and the enemies suddenly have a handful of new defensive and offensive skills.  It's just enough to make the gameplay that much more challenging and interesting.  The sidequest, while still less than great, now have stories attached to them that are worth seeing out and are much more interesting to do.

It's the same game, but really, it's not.  Just enough layer is added to make it at leas 50% more enjoyable.  Honestly, if there were a way to flashforward to the middle of the game and start there, I would say do that.  Nothing much of consequence happens in the first half, other than that you meet the characters, which you could really do at any point.  But having to wade through ten hours of boredome to get to any part worth playing through is kind of a difficult thing to recommend someone try out.

I would be a fool, however, if I didn't mention the strongest and most satisfying aspects of Nier: the character and the game world.

Nier has some of the most memorable and unique video game characters I've come across since Final Fantasy VII.  The brutish, aging father.  The half-possesed, half-dead heroine.  The young magician with the secret past.  And the millenium old floating magic book.  The voice acting is really strong and it's hard not to fall in love with this band of misfit warriors fighting back a nebulous and hard to pin down evil that lurks in every bit of shade.

I don't want to give away to much, because discovering the story is the most satisfactory part of Nier.  But, if you can force yourself through the dullest hours, the payoff at the end is (almost) worth it.  The truth behind the disease, the truth behind the monsters, the truth behind the characters: it's all really fun really imaginative science fiction.  Nier also has some very cool post-endgame material that makes a second playthrough (of the second half only, mercifully) very, very different and enlightening.

I can recommend Nier, but only to the very patient and to those who fall in love with characters.  It's not complex RPG, it's not complex gameplay, but it's fun enough (sometimes) to see the story through to the end.",Nierly there... get it?,1342396800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
3.0,False,"08 20, 2009",A9R6Z1PMRJ0BV,B000FQ2D5E,Twins Dad,"MGS4 suffers from a hideous and non-apologetic over-production boss that took this game over and turned it into a Blu-Ray movie that periodically requires user input...There should be a WARNING on the label. And while MGS4 is still a decent game, especially at the $29.99 price point, I've played at least 10 BETTER shooter-type games on the PS3, some even less than $20 now (Dark Sector, TimeShift, HAZE). Also, how anyone who has played this game could even remotely claim, ""MGS4 is not a shooter"" is beyond me. There are guns, MANY guns, correct? Your character can't survive without SHOOTING these guns, correct? MGS4 is a shooter just as much as a ""stealth game"", the degree of each depends on how you choose to play through...And that's one of the game's STRENGTHS, even though some people cringe at the thought for some unknown reason.

The basic problem with this game is the things that should be EASY are needlessly COMPLICATED and things that should be INTERESTING are absolutely BORING.  You can spend nearly half the game (which is not very long in gameplay time) just trying to figure out how to consistently target and shoot someone with any accuracy. For example, until you learn to use the first person view of the gunsight (triangle) to target someone, sometimes Snake is just staring at the wall while being pumped full of lead or you're staring at the back of his head while trying to shoot someone right in front of him (when you only use L1 to target). Of course using the sights while moving and trying to shoot an enemy means you have to 1) toggle the L stick to move while 2) toggling the R stick to use the ""floating camera"" to see around you as you move then 3) press triangle to pull up a gunsight and 4) push and hold L1 to target the enemy and FINALLY 5) push and hold R1 to actually SHOOT someone...Honestly, this is just about as ridiculously difficult as one could possibly make it to target and shoot a bad guy in a simple video game!

The learning curve is further complicated by a Menu Interface that must be pulled up (and gameplay STOPPED) if you want to do anything other than walk, stealth, ""jump-roll"", aim, fire and reload. For goodness sake, you can't even switch to a different weapon without interrupting gameplay! And if you want a weapon that's not in your ""immediate"" inventory, well, you've got to toggle through the Pause Menu to find it and switch it out with something else. In fact, you'll find yourself constantly pulling up a menu and L1ing and L2ing and toggling and toggling and Xing, ad nauseam...

Another WARNING: Get killed before a checkpoint and lose everything you just spent the past 20-min doing, including any weapon upgrades. Boy, that sure makes things fun, huh? Just to frustrate you some more, when you kill a bad guy you can't just walk over him and collect his inventory like you can when you walk over his weapon or like 95% of other games...You have to press triangle and Snake physically picks him up and gives him a Heimlich Maneuver to make him puke out his prize...Just see how annoying this becomes after about the 20th time or 50th time or 100th time...

It's still unclear to me why a guy must crap his pants under fire and then walk around with brown stains on them. Is that some kind of Japanese toilet humor? Seems like he'd have enough sense (or shame) to strip the pants off a dead guy and clean himself up instead of walking around his squad smelling like a turd rassler for the rest of the Act. Perhaps that's part of the ""Epic"" story here? Let's see...How about this one...Page 53, guy craps in a barrel, runs off butt-naked then finishes it off by soiling himself while avoiding enemy gunfire. YES...An integral part of the storyline...I'm a GENIUS! Woo-hoo!

And the developers did a fine job of effectively limiting player involvement during the 2 most important scenes of this ""Epic"" story: 1) Snake going through the microwave corridors to reach and shutdown ""GH"" and 2) the final battle between Snake and Liquid. If EVER there was an appropriate time to ask, ""WTH were they thinking?"", it's in both of these scenes...Consider that in arguably the MOST IMPORTANT EVENT in the entire game (Snake going through the microwave corridors to ""GH""), your (his) success is simply based on HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN PRESS TRIANGLE in about 2 or 3 minutes...That's IT!! Press it fast enough (maybe 400-500 times) and Snake is THE HERO! But fall short and you'll soon see every one of your remaining MGS beloved characters OFF'D in rather spectacular fashion. I'm sure Kojima forever endeared himself to his loyal throng of MetalGearHeads with that visual treat!!

After this, Snake is basically D-E-A-D...I mean, he pukes up lunch and falls face first right into it (what a way to treat the HERO of your game series, huh?) and Naomi is beckoning him from beyond the grave. His syringes no longer work and Otacon is of little help since he can't stop crying into his MacBook like a teenage girl who didn't get asked to the Prom. So Liquid strolls onto the scene and pumps Snake and himself with ""the good stuff"" syringes and Snake and he square off like kids in a schoolyard brawl. The problem is first you're just watching them fight, then you're somewhat in control of Snake, then you're watching them again, then you're pushing buttons again, rinse & repeat every few seconds. So not only did the developers feel no shame about constantly inserting cutscenes during gameplay throughout THE GAME, but they also did it liberally throughout the Final Battle itself...Simply SHAMELESS!! You basically get to press R1 to attack, then triangle to get Liquid on the ground (by video), then R1 again (to watch another video with Snake choking Liquid), then triangle again (to watch another video of Snake smackin the bejeezus out of Liquid)...Then Liquid stands up (in yet another video) and exclaims, ""Splendid, Brother!"" (which is actually pretty cool the 1st couple of times, then it loses its effect), and you're like, ""OK...So am I supposed to start fighting again, now?"" Just BIZARRE for a player to be put through something like this in the climactic fight scene of a SERIES...It reeks of CONTEMPT for the player on the part of the developers.

There's also a terrible problem that the developers have just letting someone friggin die in this game...You kill a boss, then they transform into another boss that you kill again...Then they play this cutscene that's 3 or 4 min long of them FINALLY dying! Then Drebin has to come in and tell you the SAME STORY again and again about how they were abused children who watched their familiy members die and were taken away by the Army and trained to be who they were before you just killed them...It's like you Tivo'd a show and just watch it again and again after you kill each boss (twice)...PURE FILLER!  And just think...You get to do this FOUR times!!

Or Snake has a Bowie Knife stuck 8 inches into his chest and the next scene he's good as new again...Or Raiden or Vamp ""dies"", then you see them again a couple of scenes later, then they ""die"" again. This became more like a PARODY of an action game and we even laughed hysterically when Raiden shows up near the end WITH NO FREAKIN' ARMS AND A SWORD IN HIS MOUTH ready to take on a couple dozen Baddies (who, oddly enough, are armed to the teeth but just stand there and stare at Snake and Raiden for several minutes instead of attacking)...Snake even has to take the sword and put it back in Raiden's mouth when he's through talking...Are you kidding me??? LOL...Then after this he even shows up AGAIN in a hospital room all put back together. This is just too much!!  And another person decides she can't take it anymore (can't say I blame her) so she hits herself in the neck with the ""Death Syringe"" not once, not twice but unbelievably THREE TIMES before she finally shuts the hell up and dies! In fact, I think she was still mumbling something incoherently when Snake just turned around, got in the mech and left her babbling on and on while the bldg was collapsing...These are NOT the things of an ""Epic"" story. They're more along the lines of a ""Kentucky Fried Videogame"". A parody. I wouldn't be surprised if Kojima laughs so hard he pees his pants when he reads some of the 5-star falling-all-over-themselves SERIOUS reviews of this game given the pure absurdity of a hero with no arms showing up for a sword-fight! (Maybe ""it's just a flesh wound""?)

You've probably heard about the cutscenes and their insane lengths by now. It's no lie. Kudos to anyone who can actually sit through every minute of watching Sunny try to cook a couple of freakin' eggs and get Snake or Otacon to chance eating one (and she's the ""brains"" of the operation?!?). BORE ME TO TEARS, why don't you...Maybe there are a couple of eggs waiting to ambush me in the next level? Add to that the fact that you get to WATCH SNAKE CHAIN-SMOKE FOR NEARLY NINE MINUTES when the game first loads...Another 4 minutes of this when Act II loads. In fact, you're treated to this chain-smoking show EVERY TIME an Act loads...Just UNBELIEVABLE!! With all of the slick cutscenes to repeatedly interrupt gameplay and THIS is the BEST YOU GOT to show us while the game loads, Konami?

Now I realize there are a few hundred people here on Amazon that had some sort of ""spiritual experience"" when they played this game, but to be sure, not everyone is going to fall in love with MGS4 when they play it...And even though I feel BETRAYED by 339 5-Star glowing reviews (out of a total of 455), I'm still not trying to completely trash the game and everything I've stated in this review is TRUE. For me, these things keep MGS4 from being anywhere near ""the best PS3 game ever"" or ""the reason to go out and buy a PS3""...Give me a break! This actually COULD'VE BEEN a 5-star game IF 90% of the cutscene lengths were left out AND easier target/shoot controls were employed AND more gameplay was added that wasn't as repetitive AND less complicated inventory acquisition and control were added.

As it stands, this is a game with needlessly complicated controls that substitutes repetitious gameplay and excessively boring cure-for-insomnia cutscene lengths in the place of both QUALITY and QUANTITY of gameplay.  Furthermore, this ""movie"" is clearly a victim of over-production. Imagine a 2-hr summer blockbuster where almost nothing is edited out...Much of all the raw footage is included and it's now ballooned to an agonizing 8 hours long. That's what happened to MGS4. Only the most devoted fans are left in the theater when the credits roll...Everyone else left a long time ago.

Instead of being subjected to 9 minutes of chain-smoking Snake while the game initially loads, a brief ""narrative"" could have been shown to get EVERYONE up to speed with the background story. This is basically what happens in the beginning of Killzone 2 with a roughly 3 or 4-min movie and it's quite effective even if you missed the original Killzone. Once the story is set up, it's time to get in the game and not look back. The problem with MGS4 is it CONSTANTLY LOOKS BACK...In fact, nearly every new character brings with them a GAMEPLAY STOPPAGE and a BORE-ME-TO-SLEEP STORY that can go half an hour and only provide a couple more pieces of the main plot (if you can stay awake and not click ""SKIP""). Of course this absolutely DESTROYS any continuity to gameplay and results in a more forced storyline that soon falls on deaf ears because nearly everyone has already left the theater. While they were SMART to include a ""skip"" option whenever a cutscene appears, it was a strategic error to not tell the background story while the game initially loads...What follows is a soap opera feel where every character is compelled to hit a 10.0 on the Drama-Meter while telling their story that is 98% fluff material or repetition. It's a true over-production tragedy...","Decent Game Marred By Over-Production, Complicated Controls & Menu, Repetitious Gameplay",1250726400,48,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"10 9, 2011",AE1OP60IC5O82,B004VMXAWS,truster38,"I think alot of us loved last year's SHATTERED DIMENSIONS.  Yes, it wasn't an open-world game and the story was pretty silly, but the presentation was top-notch and the variety of the levels made it truly fun.  I'm certain that Activison and Beenox identified the two main themes in terms of criticism for SHATTERED DIMENSIONS: the story was weak and most gamers loved Spider-Man 2099 the most.  As a character, because of his cool look and futuristic world, he almost works better as a video game character than he ever did as a comic book character.  So now we have EDGE OF TIME, which gives us a really great story and 2099 as basically the lead character.

Man, they really overreacted.

The entire game takes place in an office building.  Yes, this is a Spider-Man video game in which you never, EVER even see the skyscrapers of New York City.  The entire game is really short, about eight hours, and because there are no changes in environment and enemies, you go from the four distinct gameplay styles of SHATTERED DIMENSIONS to what is basically one style here.  Amazing and 2099 pretty much play exactly the same in this game because their surroundings are the same, and that's really a shame.  The game chooses to not have menus between levels, as you go right from one level to the next seamlessly, which does add a cinematic feel but also highlights the sameness in the levels even more.  Each chapter is indistinguishable.  The entire game really feels like one huge eight hour level.  In fact, I was on Chapter 5 before I realized that I wasn't on the first level anymore!  I just figured the environment was going to eventually change.  The upgrades seem to have been lessened from the last game as well, and combat just doesn't feel as fun as it did in SHATTERED DIMENSIONS.  You don't need to dumb-down what was already a button-masher.  What an odd development choice.

You could argue that the difficulty levels and challenges lengthen the replay value, but I, for one, had my fill of the same labs and atriums the first playthrough and have minimal desire to return to them anytime soon.

There are three boss battles in the entire game, and they are very boring.  Again, another curious decision by the developers because what made SHATTERED DIMENSIONS so great was that each level was basically a HUGE boss battle, where you fought the boss several different times in different ways.  You even got to punch them in first-person.

So, what happened?  Well, they got Spider-Man 2099 creator Peter David to write the story, and it's a great one, with a honest-to-goodness twist you actually won't see coming.  The game is completely built around the story, and presented in a cinematic style.  The production value is through the roof in this game, and the entire opening sequence is one of the BEST I have EVER seen in video games.

But, again, it's VIDEO GAME, not a movie.  By sacrificing so much to tell the story, the developers forgot what makes a game great, and it's not the cutscenes, even ones as great-looking and fantastically-acted as the ones in this game.

I'm not a video game troll and find it juvenile and simplistic to just say things like ""Activision is evil"" or what have you, but I will say that we don't need a new Spider-Man game every single year.  This franchise is not, and shouldn't be, Call of Duty.  They won alot of goodwill for SHATTERED DIMENSIONS and, I fear, lost alot of it with EDGE OF TIME.

I'd like to take the rest of this review in a little, more personal direction, so apologies for the length.  I loved SHATTERED DIMENSIONS alot, probably more than the average person because I love the webhead dearly, and so I actually pre-ordered this game and paid the full $60 for it.  I got only more excited when I watched those behind-the-scenes interviews with the voice cast for this game, probably the most effective marketing they did.  Those videos were ALMOST false advertising.  For example, Josh Keaton and Christopher Daniel Barnes talked about how what you do in one timeline will affect the other timeline, but they made it sound like this was player-controlled.  In reality, it is not, as the game's story pre-determines each instance the timeline (read: the level you're currently playing) changes.  Laura Vandervort, whom I LOVE from INSTANT STAR and SMALLVILLE, voices Mary Jane, but she's only in the game for about five minutes total, and half the time she's just screaming.  Those promotional videos sort of suggested we'd be experiencing this actress' performance as an iconic character for more than just a cameo.  Ditto for Katee Sackhoff as Black Cat 2099, who is FANTASTIC, in a performance I would have loved to heard more of.  Finally, this game has an embarrassment of voice acting riches, as VAL FREAKIN' KILMER is also not really in the game that much.  This is a video game that has three legitimate film actors and didn't utilize their talents nearly enough.

One last thing about the voice acting.  Josh Keaton and Christopher Daniel Barnes are great Spider-Men.  Depending on who you ask, one of these two gentlemen ARE Spider-Man.  They do a fantastic job and have GREAT chemistry here.  In fact, the best part about the game is actually their dialogue, as through comic book/video game magic they can talk to each other even though they're in different time periods, so often one of them will pop up in the corner of the screen to advise/trash talk the other one.

However, as a long-time Spider-Man fan, I was absolutely offended by the characterization of these two heroes.  First of all, they spend the entire game aggressively sniping at each other, like they actually hate each other, and show very little of the class and playful nature that a real Spider-Man would.  Secondly, and most egregiously, Spider-Man 2099 is cast in the lead and Amazing Spider-Man, as in, the ACTUAL Peter Parker, is cast as the selfish, wisecracking fool who doesn't know anything.  Miguel is constantly explaining time travel and other comic book science topics to Peter, who acts like an idiot and even sports an unmasked character design that makes him look like a jocky douchebag.  Guys, Peter Parker is ALSO a scientist, a damn good one.  Some of the best Spider-Man stories deal with Peter's humanity and vulnerability, and his weakness in the face of having to do the right thing, which this story also addresses not just in his possible death but also as revealed in the big plot twist, but in no way should Spider-Man 2099 have been presented as smarter and more capable than Peter.  It's ridiculous.

Still with me?  If you're a Spider-Man fan, buy it and treat it like an interactive should-have-been animated film.  Otherwise, rent it, and pray they take a little longer to make the next game.",Better as an actual animated film,1318118400,44,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It's not noise cancelling.  In fact, it makes a point of being certain you can hear the world around you.  I guess that has its perks, particularly for those planning to use this out of doors -- and for that application this is a perfect headset -- but it means that the volume comes across as pretty low on the PS4, and it can be hard to hear other players, or even in game sounds.  I tried it with Assassin's Creed IV, and sometimes I couldn't make out what the characters were saying.

It does a much better job with the WIi U and the 3DS.  For those, it hits the sweet spot between being loud enough to clearly hear the game, but not so loud as to keep you from hearing everything else.  This is fast becoming my favorite headset for the 3DS.

Unfortunately, this Kirby game isn't like the previously mentioned title. ""The Amazing Mirror"" was definitely designed with four player co-op in mind. If you're like me and are enjoying these GBA titles in 2015, you're probably not gonna find anyone who has a GBA and ""Amazing Mirror"" to join you on your quest. Let's talk about the single player campaign. Its the same as the co-op campaign except you're playing by yourself with 3 other A.I. Kirbys. ""Amazing Mirror"" is not linear like ""Nightmare"". In fact, its quite the opposite. Your goal is to find the 8 shards of the amazing mirror. You'll start at your central hub which begins with one door. As you progress you will unlock more doors which act as shortcuts to the central hub. While you are in the different areas of the game, it can get quite confusing, which leads to ""Amazing Mirror""s downfall. The map, assuming you have found it (think Zelda's dungeons) will show you where you have been, where you're going, and where the boss is who has one of the shards you need. You can easily skip a boss or two and get the shards in any order you wish. Problem is, most of the time you stumble on to the next area, instead of the boos or map you were looking for. That's my biggest problem with this game. SO MANY DOORS! Too many paths to take! Seriously, each square of the map you are in may have 3 different doors which is 3 different paths. What I cannot stand in this Kirby game is there are MANY dead ends. If you stumble into a dead end you are screwed. You must take a warp star back to the central hub. Now had you not found the door which takes you to the hub as a shortcut, you are gonna be doing a lot of backtracking. The map looks like a freaking tree with a the path choices you have. Yeah, its ugly. Your A.I. Kirby partners are no where to be seen unless you summon them on your cell phone. That's right, Kirby got himself a cell. On to the brighter side of things, the power ups are much cooler than in ""Nightmare"". You have the basics, spark, laser, hammer, etc. However they have added some new ablilties as well. You now have ""cook"" which functions exactly like Kirby's final smash in Super Smash Bros Brawl. You have ""smash"" which functions like Kirby plays in the Smash Bros series. They tweaked a couple existing abilities as well. For instance, ""fight"" now functions like actually fighting. Gone are the ways of sucking people up and body slamming them. Now, when you have ""fight"" you will punch and kick in a fury of blows. So I would have to say that while I enjoy ""Amazing Mirror"", its just too confusing to progress and very frustrating when you cant get to where you need to go.

3.0,False,"04 21, 2013",A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B008H0CM42,A. Whitehead,"A Caribbean politician becomes the ruler - 'El Presidente' - of the small country of Tropico, scattered across several islands. He must guide his nation to peace and prosperity, evading rebel coups and placating the feuding superpowers along the way.

Tropico 4 is a city-building simulator, belonging to the same genre as the SimCity series. The twist of this game is that the setting is the Caribbean and the emphasis is on building relatively small cities based around industry and tourism, with the player also having to balance the needs of both the people, foreign powers and a number of internal factions to achieve success.

Whilst there are various scenario and sandbox modes, the core of the game is the campaign. This is a story-driven narrative that unfolds across 20 scenarios (although, rather lazily, there are only 10 maps: each map is used twice, but in most cases is supposed to be a different island) and acts as an extended tutorial: the very brief actual tutorial isn't much help, but the missions expand on the concepts from the tutorials quite nicely. In most cases, the game unfolds the same way: you start off with a palace and several other buildings and have to build up both your population (by allowing large-scale immigration and building homes for the newcomers) and your sources of revenue (by building mines, plantations, farms and tourist facilities). However, you also have to keep the population happy by building healthcare, religious, entertainment and education facilities, and you also have to keep the various factions happy. The capitalists will be satisfied if you build mines across the entire island, but the resulting pollution will annoy the environmentalists. Immigration will anger the nationalists, but the lack of free healthcare and housing will irritate the communists. Unhappy citizens will become rebels, requiring you to build up a military force to deal with them, which means diverting funds away from the economy. And so on.

As a city-builder, Tropico 4 is very entertaining. Building networks of roads and slamming down buildings like an overgrown Lego set is satisfying, and the game's impressive 3D engine allows you to zoom down to street corners and see what individual citizens are up to. A comprehensive almanac reports back on how happy the citizens, factions and foreign powers are and offers suggestions on how to improve weaker areas. Most of the scenarios will be completed before your cities get too large, but on a few occasions I ended up with substantial metropolises incorporating huge residential areas, large industrial zones, a thriving tourist sector and entertainment-focused downtown areas. When everything goes to plan, it's a very satisfying experience.

The game does have its issues. As with all of these sort of games, it won't be long before you work out an optimum early-game build-order which gets you a lot of cash in short order, which makes the rest of the mission trivially easy. The campaign, complete with scripted and often-unpredictable events, is good at throwing you curveballs you have to deal with on the fly, ranging from out-of-control UN inspectors imposing arbitrary restrictions on your economy and industry to rogue Russian nuclear missiles threatening to hit the island. Another problem is that there is often a substantial lag - sometimes 3-5 years of in-game time, maybe half an hour of real playing - between you doing something and the results starting to trickle in (most notable when it comes to building new agricultural projects). Most annoying is that the game is centred around the road network and particularly whether there's enough garages for everyone to park their cars (without garages your population will be reduced to walking everywhere, which is hideously inefficient). You'll end up with garages on every corner and at every single out-of-town facility on the island, and a road network covering almost every open surface area to reduce the hideous traffic bottlenecks that slow down your economic development.

Once you get used to the game's eccentricities, it doesn't take long to realise there isn't a massive amount of depth here. There's dozens of buildings, numerous factions and foreign powers to appease, but it's all on a fairly broad base lacking more interesting subtleties or complexities. Once you understand the game's systems, it's fairly easy to get every faction behind you, avoid rebellions and make absolute bucketloads of money. The sheer depth and replayability of something like SimCity 4 is missing. Tropico 4 is certainly much more approachable and easy to play than some of the more hardcore city builders, and may make a viable step-up for someone used to playing CityVille who wants to tackle something more interesting, but ultimately the game runs out of steam before the campaign itself is completed, although the last couple of missions do reignite some interest with more original plot twists.

It's also worth noting that Tropico 4 is a refinement and expansion of Tropico 3 rather than a radically different game. Newcomers to the series are certainly advised to start with Tropico 4, which has a more refined interface, a more compelling (and useful) campaign and (slightly) better graphics, but those who have already played the third game may not find a lot more here than in the existing title.

Tropico 4 (***) is a fun city simulator. It's enjoyable, has an amusing (if occasionally close-to-the-knuckle stereotyping) sense of humour and is far less obtuse than some similar games. However, it also lacks a huge amount of depth and is unlikely to have people continuously returning to it for years to come. Recommended, especially on budget.

Perhaps this was the programmers' way to try to make the game and the too-short levels more difficult, but I figured out a way to get around this almost immediately (to simply quit and reload the saved game is exactly the same as using up a life or a continue), so the lives system didn't increase the challenge much, only the level annoyance.
Good points:  The controls are not nearly as stiff as, say, Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, and Buffy fans will enjoy watching the characters in the show interact -- even if their backgrounds are always the same and the ""cut scenes"" are all in stills.  A Gameboy Advance cartridge probably doesn't have the storage for captured scenes, so I think the effort to try to get the stars of the show into the cut scenes (which would have cost much more money) is admirable.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is of course a given (who would buy a Buffy game without her face?), but having Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, Nicolas Brendon and Emma Caulfield reprise their characters at least adds an element of authenticity, underwhelming as that presence is.
To be fair, I've played franchise games (such as Evil Dead:  Hail to the King) that have shirked design and mechanics far more than this game, and the quirky Buffy environments are fun to navigate through.  You pretty much have to be a fan of the show already to play this game, but if you are, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.","Too short and simplistic, but fun for Buffy fans.",1059004800,7,,

It still has a lot of the creepiness of the first two in the series for those that love that about the Dead Space universe. I did however feel the game needed a breakup of settings of sorts, and this game definitely delivers on that front. However, I do agree that it seems kind of not certain of what it exactly wants to be, and that the combat situations are clunky and not done very well. However, what bothers me by far the most about this game as opposed to the first two are 1), it is MUCH harder. I played this game on the easiest level, and was still fighting for my life at every turn, so much so that it wasn't even fun. On it's easiest level (casual), it was harder than Dead Space 2 was on the next level up. You practically don't have a moment to relax and catch your breath, ever, which brings me to the next thing I hated about this game, 2) the weapons crafting system, is an overly complicated mess! Gone is the simplistic way the first two games allowed you to upgrade your weapons, and no matter how you upgrade them, they are never nearly as powerful as the situation calls for, which is again, part of what makes it so much harder (and not as fun) as Dead Space 2. Even when you find a weapon that works well against a certain necromorph, it may not work as well against a different necromoprh, on the SAME LEVEL. Who cares how good it may work against one type of enemy, when it works like crap against the very next one! This may not be as big of deal, but unlike the first two Dead Space games, where you could carry up to four weapons, you can never carry more than two here, which only leaves you even less prepared to face the necromorphs who are literally in droves around every corner.

3.0,False,"04 13, 2003",AWXPAJ7VG5D4Y,B000067O0P,Phil L.,"I agree with many of the other 3-star reviews of this game.
As a new player, I downloaded the demo and instantly got hooked. I zoomed to level 30 (level 150 seems to be the current cap), and had a wonderful time exploring new systems, trading supplies, and fighting weird mobs. The universe is immersive, and the NPCs have interesting tales to tell and missions to give you.
However, after a week of playing, the game began coming to a real grind. Those once fascinating, far-off systems have already been explored, and the trade routes are now routine, and you have to do those routes twenty or thirty times over to gain a single level. Once explored, there is little risk trading or travelling, as you simply warp between waypoints and most mobs can't interfere. You just wait until you reach the next waypoint, gate to a new system (which are always protected by high level friendly mobs), and warp again to your destination.
When you dock at a starbase, you now approach those interesting NPCs only to break the monotony, hoping you're in the mood to do whatever roundabout, 30-minute, across the galaxy mission they're currently offering (usually for a tiny bit of extra EXP).
It's an expensive monthly payment for a game that isn't half the multiplayer quality of Dark Ages of Camelot or even Everquest. Different genres, but basically the same type of game.
Combat and grouping is very awkward, and even after weeks of play I still have trouble targeting mobs or ""healing"" groupmates. There is no Player-vs-Player combat and the faction system is very difficult to break away from - unless you have a powerful, high level ship you'll always be a Good Guy. You won't become a true pirate anytime soon.
The game shows promise, with continual additions to the universe and a sort of ongoing storyline (which just kicked in the past few months, but so far has no real impact on gameplay).
Player to player communication is especially difficult, and hopefully the weird chat system will be fixed soon. You can't see levels or class of other characters (even in your own guild) unless they happen to be in the same Sector as you, and the chat windows have difficult to read fonts and non-adjustable screen positions and transparency... regardless of what resolution you run the game at. Inside starbases, I found myself constantly facing gray or black walls just to read my conversation windows.
Graphics are great (but lag even on high end systems), sound is good, and the interface - once you get used to how it works and what icons mean what - is servicable. Beware that the perceived fun of zooming through levels wears off after the first few days of gameplay. Then, the dreaded ""grind"" sets in.

The goods:
*  Actual Simepsons' character voice acting.
*  More depth than is experienced in other Simpsons titles.
*  Nearly enough stuff to explore and discover...gags, hidden items, etc.
*  Character outfits and vehicles taken directly from the Television show.
*  Springfield is layed-out well.
The Bads:
*  Repetitive missions - Tail this, destroy that, race here, collect these...they're all basic driving missions.  No real variety.
*  Repetitive levels - You get 3 areas of Springfield, yet you play the missions twice during the story mode...daytime and evening.
*  Levels not very interactive - Sure, you get X number of gags in each level, but you can't interact with most pedestrians, you can't do much exploring (most yards you can't enter, very few buildings to enter, etc)
*  Limited number of characters to play as - It'd be nice if you could complete some of the levels with different characters.  Sure, Marge and Lisa have a place in the story line, but wouldn't it be fun to play as Willy, or Fat Tony, or someone different?  Some characters are just bland and it'd be nice to be able to change the pace a bit.
*  Replay value is nearly nil.  Once you defeat the main story, what else is there?  Plus you can defeat the game in a day's time.

- There is no alternate mode available to play.  When you start out, you pretty much have to play Story Mode.  You get very limited control over which X-Man you play as.  Yes, there is a roster of tried-and-true favourites to choose from -- Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Rogue and Jean Grey -- but they're not all available at the same time, and their abilities are poorly balanced (Wolverine is overpowered as usual, but Cyclops positively sucks).

- Why bother having a Danger Room training mode if the only character you can train is Magma?  When you start out, there *are* a few team-training missions where you can build up the abilities of your preferred X-Man, but it's not possible to do the single-character training lessons as any character other than Magma.  Boo.

- Each mission is far, far too long, with too much running around looking for things to smash.  The second mission in the game (also the first mission proper) took me about two hours to finish.  Two hours!  When your characters actually go up nine levels in one mission, you know you have a design problem.  By the time I got to the end, the fun was gone.  The maps should have been half the size.

- With such long missions, you better give us the healing icons we need.  Well, in this game, healing icons are mostly hidden in environments and objects you have to destroy, and you get maybe one healing icon every 20 objects you smash.  So when your health is low, you end up running around smashing objects desperately hoping the game would actually give you a healing item.  Absolutely dreary.

- The save-game system is one of the worst I've ever encountered.  What could the logic be of not having an auto-save feature at the end of missions?  If you finish a mission, you end up at the Xavier Mansion -- where it's supposed to be safe haven, right?  Unfortunately, this game has a habit of launching super-hard missions at you when you're not intending to move on in the game.  I was just about to catch my breath after the two-hour first mission when the game sprang a ""flashback"" on me.  Turns out this was a mission like any other where you have to battle eight sentinels at a time, whose attacks take half your health -- no exaggeration.  Maybe the game programmers had a ball designing this mission; playing it was like water torture.

- The loading times are excruciating.  Even when you press start to pause the game, there is a substantial lag, and loading times between parts of a level are inexcusable.  This game really doesn't seem that much more complex than others of its type -- why the long loading times?

I enjoyed this game at first, but after about an hour and a half of struggling with the above issues, it got to be laborious and joyless.  Too bad, because this game had born the promise of being the best X-Men game yet outside of Capcom's two-player fighting games.  It allows you to progress your characters and features a plethora of background detail.

He looks more like a Teenager in Twighlight Princess for the WEI system, so I took the plunge.

The cartoon like graphics don't get on my nerves as much as some people, in fact Nintendo is known for it. What really worked me on this game was the camera when you faced the bosses.

For some reason the camera was always trying to give me great shots of Link, which is nice if you're watching a movie but not good if you're facing a target that is trying to kill you! And once the camera view changed, so did the directional control. I find myself more than a few times stuck against a wall or in a corner, while the various bosses would let me have it!

I also didn't like the way the camera would swing wildly to the front view of Link, like a reverse angle, everytime he would come out of a door when exploring. It gave me motion sickness after about five hours of game play.

Another thing that was a problem for me was sailing to the next mission. It seemed to take forever and I couldn't steer the boat very well, especially when the sharks would come out and attack or trying to dig for treasure in the sea.

Aside from the problems I've had with the game, the good thing was the cinematic after you launch the grappling hook. When you find a target that you can actually hook onto, the game cuts to a cinematic that shows the grapple flying around it. Actually this was also a bad thing because it happens when you are facing one of the bosses and it really gets annoying to see the cut-scene when your adrenaline is pumping.

Another good thing is that all the established features of the other Zelda games are here including the reviving fairies, the puzzles, the interaction etc. and the involved story line.

But the number one question on everybodys mind is, how dose it match up to the other Tomb Raider's.

It keeps the flavor of prime Lara Croft from let's say Anniversary, but if fails as a sequel. Underworld is the much antisapated sequel to Tomb Raider: Legend, which had a more relistic plot-line and made you feel you're there in a good action movie, and kept you right along with the plot. However in Underworld everything changes durasticaly and the game gives off a sence of un-reality, leaving you saying ""Yeah Right!"" So it fails as being a sequel, how dose it measure up on other things?

GAMEPLAY:
The gameplay for Underworld is relitivly normal to the others, with a few new things here and there.  You do get to wield you're two pistols, however it isn't somthing really remarkable, and get's kinda boring. You get your grapple hook (new since Ledgend) Your dual guns. And some other weapons you collect along the way. you can, however, change Lara's outfits at the beggining of the mission, you can choose from three ( or two wetsuits during water missions).
Warning: However, the camera's are different (in PS3)and the tend to give me massive headaches. the camera angle is absolutly terrible always jumbling around. So I hope you don't have that proberlem with the game.

GRAPHIC'S:
The best part of the game is undoubtbly the graphic's. there are beautiful, and is some of the best graphic's I've seen a PS3 game so far. Except for the charictars, mercenaries, wildlife. they are pretty same-old stuff.

The game dose have the 'flavor' of a Lara Croft game.

Now why is that? Well I guess you're not supposed to feel for the guy who plays the lead in a sci-fi shooter... the game is all about blowing stuff up, after all, isn't it?

 That is probably enough for most gamers, especially between the age of 14 and 18. But at 26, my tastes are evolving. I am beginning to feel that if you've played any first person shooter you've played them all. They're are all either a knock off of Goldeneye 007 (IMO still the best FPS ever made) or Halo, so playing this title late, AFTER playing through the mega disappointing Perfect Dark Zero I just wasn't able to develop any love for the Halo series outside its superb multiplayer mode, or the silly parody Red V Blue. I am simply having trouble identifying or feeling the emotions of the story. The potential for something more refined and sophisticated is there, I just hope that Bunjie can capitalize on that in the 3rd installment rather than making another Jerry Brokheimer the video game.

 At any rate Halo 2 falls into yet another ho-hum sci-fi tale that will probably excite the average gamer, but being that I prefer more sophisticated stories it didn't do much for me.",Isn't hype wonderful?,1138838400,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,False,"11 24, 2010",A1L9ARVFKFOYIU,B001E7MMNG,MJM,"First things first, Splatterhouse is not a game you should pick up for full price! It would make a great rental or even a used purchase which by the way I'm sure it will be available very shortly and with a more reasonable price tag on the used market. I was fortunate enough to get a really good deal on this game, which was one of the main reasons I took a chance with it. With that being said, this isn't a horrible game by any means, but it's also nothing special.

This game has your basic very generic storyline, so keep that in mind if you decide to play it. I know videogames as a whole are expected to have deep and compelling storylines, to keep us intrigued as to what happens next and to help us relate and/or associate with the characters, kind of like an interactive book if you will. Splatterhouse however is not about the story; it's about the carnage, the blood and of course finding the most ridiculously insane way to kill something! I would compare it to the campy horror movies of the 80's. Friday the 13th was never about why Jason was the way he was, rather how he killed as many half naked/buck naked teenagers he could before the credits rolled. In a nutshell it's comparable to watching Friday the 13th with Headbangers ball playing in the background. Many gamers today may not recognize Headbangers Ball but if you're old enough to have played the original Splatterhouse when it was first released you probably will.

As with many other games the game play gets very repetitive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you only like to play the first couple of hours of a game then move on to something different or just want a mindless fun way to help get your aggression out. Honestly I don't really see many people finishing this game, there's just no real reason to. The makers of the game leave parts to naked photos of Rick's girlfriend for you to find, don't ask me why I guess they think by doing so it would entice adolescent boys to finish the game, which seems to be the target audience anyway. I know what does that say for me LOL. The biggest reason and my motivator to finish the game is that you unlock the original three Splatterhouse games.

The graphics will not blow you away by any stretch of the imagination; actually they seem more like something you would see on the PS2/Xbox. There is no online feature, so if you're looking for anything other than the single player campaign look elsewhere. There is however some challenge maps that are pretty entertaining but nothing really amazing here either. As I said prior the soundtrack is very much metal, so if that's not your thing then you may want to play with the sound off and if you're into it blast some Justin Bieber while you do your splattering. My only other complaint (as if I haven't complained enough) is the camera; it can be kind of clunky at times and can cause you to get a smack down.

Now for some good news, for the most part the auto save feature is pretty reliable with a few hiccups along the way. Meaning there are times you would believe the game would save due to the progress you've made but for some reason doesn't, so if you die you're going back to start of the checkpoint and must make your way back to where you were. But again that's few and far between, most of the time the check points are located in logical and beneficial areas for the player. The mayhem you can cause can also be fun, in short doses of course, it's a good thing the chapters are rather short. The controls are pretty fluid, and the designers did a good job allowing you to chain together combos. The most entertaining element of the game has to be the mask, they did a good job writing smartass comments and of the wall shtick for him.

I know based on what I have said above you would think I would rate this game a one star out of five! However believe it or not there are reasons to play this game, but not for full price. There is hours of mindless blood and gore to be had and if you're like me and have played the originals it will bring back memories. Twenty dollars would be a perfect price for this game; thirty would be the highest I would go.

Whether it was the plasmids, the engaging storyline, or the sick graphics.  Having said that, you get basically a new dose of ""Adam"" even though you're thoroughly spent.  What made the first Bioshock utterly amazing was the fact it was essentially a unique game playing experience that no other game could offer.  Wielding guns and plasmids made for a great time killing ""Adam""-addicts and Big Brothers, etc. Going into the unknown of Rapture itself was definitely an experience because you as the player did not know what the city was capable or nor what was living in it.  The second time around, I kinda yawned through parts of it as there really wasn't too much that was new this time as you're basically the hero once again in the same city, doing the same thing (using guns and plasmids to kill the baddies), and either rescuing or harvesting Little Sisters.  If you're expecting a completely new game where it's a new city and a ton of new features that the first game didn't have, you'll be sorely disappointed.  But if you can honestly call yourself a huge fan of the first and don't mind getting more of the same, this game is definitely for you.  Personally, I felt the majority of this game was as if I bought NCAA Football 10 after being in love with NCAA Football 09 or any other yearly update of a sports game.  Don't get me wrong, the Bioshock series is better than 90% of games out there, but there was too much that was rehashed for me to really consider this a GOTY or anything in the upper echelon of games.  The fascination and curiosity I had throughout playing the first game was not present as I knew what to expect (for the most part) and how to work my way through the game.

3.0,False,"10 28, 2011",A1QCUMGX7UHFL5,B004S5PBM0,Adam L.,"I'll prefix by saying I've been playing guitars for over 25 years. I play for fun, and even after all this time I'm not that great. Mostly because I never practice. I can, however, pick up songs and play them by ear. I also write and record my own music. With that in mind, I'm definitely not a beginner, nor am I a virtuoso of the instrument.

Ok, so I was excited to check this out. GuitarHero/Rockband/clones were amusing, but if you know how to play guitar it seemed really weird. I figured this would be a great way to learn some new songs, and thought perhaps my wife might like playing guitar with guidance. Popped this in the Xbox 360, and the first thing I noticed was that their idea for a loading icon is a static microphone (or was it a guitar amplifier cabinet? I don't remember.) I wasn't sure if it was actually loading for quite a while. Get used to seeing that icon, because it loads frequently.

After loading is complete it goes through a bit of calibration where you strum the guitar and it sets the levels for it. Then it takes you through an electronic tuner which ensures your guitar is in tune. All pretty straight-forward stuff. One annoying thing that is repeated everywhere in the game is how they labeled ""Next"" as ""Skip"". I sat there for a while after a voice over played, wondering if there was more. Nope. You have to click the A button to move on to the next part. I'm sure you can see how this is confusing. You're left wondering if you're skipping something instead of the game verifying that the section has completed.

Next up is the ability to dive in and play a song. They tried to do a Guitar Hero/Rockband type of presentation, where notes appear moving towards you from a distant plane in 3d space. Each string is color coded, and the camera will slide to the left or right if the notes are higher or lower on the fretboard. The problem here is that unlike the other games which have a fake guitar that only has 4 buttons on it, you're playing a real guitar with 21+ frets. The way the notes fly out from infinity towards their targeted position on the fretboard can be confusing, especially when the camera starts sliding down to the higher fretboard positions. I felt like I was always struggling to figure out finger placement because of the way the notes were being displayed. Even slow and simple songs left me feeling like it was more of a hassle than it was worth.

The other hindrance is latency. When you pluck the string there is a very noticeable delay between the pluck and when the note is played by the game. This makes it incredibly difficult to play notes which appear rapidly on the screen, as what you're hearing doesn't synchronize with what you're playing. There's a tip that scrolls across the screen which suggests that if there's problems with latency, try bypassing internal circuitry on your amp (mine is always direct when playing the Xbox 360) or plug in headphones. So much for being a fun thing to watch if you're a bystander. I didn't try headphones as I spend enough time when recording real music with headphones on, and since this game is more than likely going to be played on the family's TV the last thing you want to do is stand there plucking away at an electric guitar while others can't hear what you're playing against. So I was stuck with latency.

Next is the voice-over. There's no way to get the guy to stop talking during a voice-over cut-scene. You will sit through what he has to say from beginning to end, unless you either exit the game or turn off your console.

One thing good I'll say about it is it seems to learn how well you're doing, and adjust the experience. If you're starting to do well, it will begin throwing in more notes for you to play. I guess this is good and bad, because if you just start getting the hang of what's happening, the game starts throwing you curve-balls pretty quickly.

Just as a test I had my wife, who doesn't know how to play guitar at all, give it a shot. After all, the back of the case says ""Anyone can play guitar"". So she gave it a shot. She was irritated she couldn't skip past the voice-over. She picked a song to play, and started it. All she was able to barely do was hit two of the notes. As soon as the camera slid up the fretboard to play different notes on different strings, she was utterly and completely lost. Needless to say, she didn't want to try it again, and was extremely frustrated by it.

This game could have been fun. Marrying a real instrument with a video game console is a great idea. The things they need to do, in my opinion, to fix this:

- Don't do this in a Rock Band/Guitar Hero style. That type of interaction simply does NOT work for this kind of experience in my opinion.
- Add tutorial modes, where people can practice the types of notes they will be playing in a song. Let the player control the speed during these practice sessions.
- Fix the latency, as no matter how fancy the graphics or brilliant the user interface is (assuming they come out with a v2 that has a brilliant interface - because this one does not) the game will remain unplayable.
- Don't use ""Skip"" for controlling the UI when what's really meant is ""Next""
- Allow people to blow past voice-overs.
- Don't make customers have to use a controller. The guitar they just calibrated and tuned should be used to control the game. The only exception would be to cancel a song in progress (and maybe a few other places where the game is expecting notes to be played back.)","Awesome concept, flawed execution",1319760000,7,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: Sub-par graphics, jerky character animations, most of the consoles' features are stripped out, no infrastructure, too linear, cheap enemy AI

I haven't had the honor to play GRAW 2 on the home consoles yet so I picked up the PSP version and well...you can just compare it to Rainbow Six Vegas that was released a few months ago. The game is a dumbed down version of GRAW 2 with less features.

The controls are really nice and all and the missions are smooth but everything is just above mediocre.

In GRAW 2 you just play as Mitchell and you don't get your other 3 squad members and a lot of the other features like the rover and all that are gone.

To me it felt a lot like GRAW 1 which isn't a bad thing. The levels are extremely linear and there's just one way to go. The enemy AI is pretty cheap and the animations are pretty jerky and odd looking. There aren't that many guns in the game and there's no infrastructure multiplayer mode.

When the Director's Cut was announced I decided to give it another go.

The DC has its own set of trophies, which are identical as the original release, but it also contains the trophies from the Missing Link expansion, which is the main addition to this version - and it's also the biggest problem I have with it.

One of my gripes with the original version was that it was far too long and featured levels that were very similar to each other. The only real visible atmosphere in DE: HR is in the City Hub scenes, while the actual levels are quite generic and indistinguishable. How do you make this more tedious? Add two more levels, of course?

And not only that, but the Missing Link addition is very, very long. It slows the story down and sidetracks the momentum. On the previous edition the Missing Link trophies did not count towards the Platinum as they were part of the DLC, but here, as part of the full game, they do. And one of the Missing Link trophies is to complete those levels using no weapons or Praxis kits, which is damn near impossible.

As a DLC these extra levels naturally started you off with zero Praxis upgrades since it was a stand-alone story. As part of the Director's Cut it means that all of the upgrades that you have worked for have been unfairly robbed of you. And that Foxiest of Hounds trophy, which is won if you make it through the entire game without setting off any alarms, is made even harder now that the Missing Link levels are included. Not only does the game not tell you or help you keep track of levels with alarms, but expanding it with these very long and difficult Missing Link missions is just plain cruel, or perhaps just very lazy if the developers didn't consider this.

Other differences are slightly modified boss battles, and (apparently) improved graphics, though I didn't notice any, if anything I noticed more glitches, and the low-res cloud detail in the sky still looks like it was made for a 1998 era CD-ROM. But of all the so-called improvements made to this DC they missed out THE most important one of all.

The game takes ages to install but still spends ages loading each level or restart.

And you know what that means, kiddies! That's right, many, long, long loading times. What were they thinking? Again, this is either out of cruelty, or it's just plain short-sighted laziness.

I do recommend Deus Ex: Human Revolution for the story, music, and atmosphere. But if you really want to experience it then go for the original release. This DC is a huge misjudgement.

3.0,True,"05 21, 2016",A1G7SBE1W49DNS,B00KO97D8E,BRIAN SOLOW,"My review of Homefront the Revolution for the PS4

Pro

Interesting story - While the story in Homefront the Revolution can come off as being cheesy I really didn't have an issue with it (I like how they show the 2 North Koreans working in a garage which look very similar to the way the late Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak did). I like these alternate history story from 2003 Freedom Fighter (in which the Russians won the Cold War) to 2014 Wolfenstein The New Order & Amazon Instant Video The Man in the High Castle (in which the Nazi won World War 2 which for me as a Jewish person is very scary indeed) to the 90s sitcoms Sliders.

Long Campaign - From someone who enjoys games with a strong single contents (there is a four player co-op mode) this to me is a plus. The campaign is about (from what Ive heard) 20 hours long but it can be longer if you are willing to take on the side missions like random events, finding radios & weapons stash and side jobs like kill 5 seekers with a shotgun or take out a certain number of KPA soldiers with a molotov cocktail.

FarCry Approach - For those who like the way Ubisoft approaches open world games then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution. Basically you hack some kind os server (very easy to do) and once is done other areas in the map will open up such as bases and other side things to do. Bottom line is if you like that kind of approach in an open world game then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution.

Guerrilla Tactics - I like how Homefront the Revolution encourage you not to go in gun ho (you can but you will get easily kill). instead you have to take a cautious approach like instead trying to go in the front door of a n enemy base you could
A. see if there is a ramp and if there is one you can hop on a motorcycle and ride the ramp into the enemy base or
B. find a backdoor and unlock it and try to take a stealthy approach to it and try to take down the enemy quietly.

Modifying Your Weapons on the Fly - And finally another neat feature I like that they put into Homefront the Revolution is the ability to add & switch attachment to your weapons. For example if you want to add (or detach) a scope to your shotgun or assault rifle all you have to do is push the up button on your PS4 control to bring up what attachment are available, hold the R1 button and move the left analog stick to which scope you want to use and it will be added on to your weapon right away (you don't have to go to your base to add or remove modification to your weapon). Also you do have the ability to craft certain weapons like molotov cocktail or home made bombs (youll need the material to make them since they are scattered all across the game).

Cons

Too similar to FarCry - Although I enjoyed the gameplay in Homefront the Revolution it really doesnt do anythings that hasn't been in other games like the Assassin Creed or FarCry series or even the Watch Dogs game. It doesnt mean its a bad game it just doesnt do any thing new that all.

Lack of Polish - Probably the biggest issue facing Homefront the Revolution. While the game is certainly playable you can definitely see the lack of polish in this game. First off youll need to download the day one patch because the game without it is almost unplayable and while the the patch does fix a lot of the problems there are still some issue such as getting stuck in one place (this happen to me once and I had to restart the game at my last save), ok visuals (a little bit better then The Divisions but that not saying much), a below 30fps ( probably around 25fps), a somewhat long loading screen and finally Ive notices that every time I exit a shop the game pauses for about 5 to 10 second.

Overall - I have mix feeling about Homefront the Revolution. While I definitely like the approach they made to this game. Its lack of polish is what hold it back and I think that a damn shame thought (not to mention the development hell it went through). While I don't think the game is as bad as some reviewers have said its far from a perfect game and that a shame because I do want this game to do well but I have a feeling there a good chance this game will more then likely flop.",A good open-world FPS held back by a lack of polish,1463788800,40,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I can basically run everything maxed out. I'm saying this in order to contextualize my (very) short analysis of Killzone: Shadow Fall, which I'll break down into a few parameters.

Pros:
I found the game beautiful, rivaling with the most beautiful games currently on PC. The textures, character models and all I could see looked really good and pleased me. The campaign runs at an almost constant 60 FPS which, to me, is the least the new generation could offer. The best part, however, is the artistic component: I found the character and architectural designs top notch and extremely believable. Vekta City looks beautiful and very believable, and the color pallet is great, with its saturated reds and blues.
The Multiplayer, however, runs at 30 FPS, and this is sad because it makes the overall experience much, much less enjoyable: the gameplay ends up feeling dragged-on, almost as if the game was running in slow motion, and it frequently drops bellow 30 FPS. It can still be fun, but could have been much better.

Cons:
The game is buggy and glitchy. There are graphical glitches in a lot of the places, especially the run-down, rubble buildings. But the worst part is the sound. Although I enjoyed the musical score and the gun sounds, I frequently had it cut on me, especially in multiplayer. At first I thought it was an effect, as to simulate deafness from explosions, but that's not it. Also, everything sounds muddled and low, and I found it really hard to understand the story since the music and explosions always muffled the voice.

All in all it was a good game and I intend on playing it further as to unlock more Trophies, but I can't shake the feeling of disappointment. It could have been much better and I feel it was rushed as to follow the PS4 release.

3.0,True,"04 17, 2013",A26TA02CCYUNFF,B00576U8CC,giantsalike,"When this game originally released, there were some serious issues involving the servers. It was a hindrance most PC gamers and MMO gamers are relatively used to but for console gamers, this is something entirely new to us. Right off the bat, many people were put off by the difficulty to actually get on a server and play the game. As of late, the servers may be up and running but many of the players have vanished since then.

As for the game itself, it starts off a bit slow. You aren't given much direction and the storyline feels almost non-existent. Players create an character given the limited customization options and are also asked to choose a respective background for their character. The backstory behind your character is irrelevant as it only defines your original outfit and starting weapons. Your character also never speaks so it's not like a backstory would make much of a difference anyways.

The storyline doesn't really pick up until about halfway through the game and if you purchase this game for the Xbox then you'll have no idea when you're actually halfway through the game. Each achievement, when unlocked, changes it's requirements to a clever or seemingly dull phrase that makes it almost impossible to decipher which achievement it is. If you're dedicated, you'll suddenly stop and check your achievements to find out you're in Act 3 of the story.

The voice acting is well, okay. To be honest, some of it is rather laughable but it's hard to say that it's absolutely horrible. There really isn't much character development in the beginning so you don't start feeling important until half way through the game. Mind you that you'll often forget about the main storyline if you go off and do the ungodly amount of side missions and little mini-game missions across the unbelievably large map.

The gameplay isn't too bad; however, it lacks a social sphere. Like most MMOs, area chat is often fluttering with conversation and there are usually definitive social hubs for players to gather at and trade. In Defiance, on the consoles, there's none of that. There are vendors that players can gather at but typing out messages on an on-screen keyboard is far too time consuming for most players. In-game voice chat only works when players group up with one another, which, unless you have friends or a dedicated clan, you won't find too many of them.

It plays like a straight third-person shooter with a loot system similar to Borderlands. Enemies drop loot ranging from money, to resources (for mods and what not), and weapons/shields. They are colored coded and assorted by rank or EGO rating. Your character and use any weapon he or she likes and be able to keep up with the rest of the group; however, assault rifles appear to be the most used weapons as they often have the best range and DPS.

As for your skill trees, you are given a choice of one of the four powers on a massive grid. You can then upgrade your character according to your skill or slowly branch off into another power for added perks. Your character, as he or she levels, is given perk slots to use your abilities in combat. They can range from damage reduction, critical hit bonuses, to a whole range of useful and useless goodies. Most players seem to use the Overcharge and/or Cloak abilities.

The game does promote co-operative gameplay; however, at the moment, you aren't able to see your friend's mission statuses yet. There are also definitive co-op maps with unique storylines and bosses tied to them. And then there are Arkfalls. Arkfalls are what really define Defiance as a game. Hundreds of players will gravitate towards the randomly placed Arkfall events to fight hordes of enemies and, in the end, a massive boss to get some pretty decent loot out of it. It's awesome to see that many players coming together and fighting alongside one another in a heated battle. It may be a bit laggy with that many people in one area but it often runs rather smoothly and becomes a relatively enjoyable experience.

Now, for those of you who are strictly in PvP, there's plenty of that too. I have noticed though that the mechanics of PvP can be a bit broken. Most individuals use a shotgun and the cloak ability to simply walk up to enemies and unload on them. It can be a bit lopsided if one player has a stronger perk set and weaponry but it's often a fair playing field.

For PvP players, there's also Shadow Wars which are the ""big team battles"" of Defiance. Hundreds of players on a map, divided into teams, playing a massive game of domination/king of the hill. There are miscellaneous AI enemies running around like raiders and cyborgs called 99ers to rustle both teams feathers a bit but it can be an enjoyable experience with a organized and strategic group of teammates.

All in all, I do enjoy this game. It's a nice casual play with some fun mechanics. There are a few bugs needing to be sorted out but the game runs rather smoothly compared to it's release. To be honest though, the game doesn't really give me enough incentive to go and watch the show (even with designated episode missions pertaining to the show) but it still is a fun game. Don't expect to be dazzled at mind-blowing graphics or completely revolutionary gameplay but be glad that Xbox finally got into the MMO field. You pay $60 for the game and you have a free subscription forever. There's an in-game store but the items are more for customization rather than game breaking weaponry (like in MMO's where you essentially pay-to-win).

If you're interested in shooters and want a casual game to play, pick this bad boy up. I personally enjoyed it and have already put countless hours into it, even in spite of it's flaws and difficult release.

For starters, the main storyline was unimaginative and mediocre at best. Ironically, some of the optional side quests seemed to have more thought out story lines. The animation in this game is poor and fails to keep up with the storyline, ex- you are shown wearing the same crappy armor in animations regardless of what you have acquired and are actually wearing. The endings in this game just plain suck. They are short, unsatisfying and make little sense. The voice acting and dialogue in this game is the worst I've ever seen. I cannot stress that enough. It's so bad it gets comical, although I'm sure that was not the intent. The game does not level up foes to match your character, so the game starts out really hard, where its difficult to kill even the weakest enemy. But then after leveling up enough the games gets really easy and you can kill most anything with one or two hits.

The game play graphics are actually pretty good and there is ample opportunity to level up and to acquire weapons and armor. This game has unique feature I liked where you could combine the same weapon or armor types to make a stronger version. There is a large map to explore and a number of quests with some choices on how you complete them. The combat style also varies somewhat depending what weapon you choose. You can also choose to ride and fight while riding one of four different steeds, some of which look pretty cool. Unfortunately, the combat while on the steeds is do difficult and cumbersome you won't want to do it. Further, you cannot take your steeds through the teleporters which quickly becomes your main way to travel.

Well, the Mario games so far for GameCube (""Luigi's Mansion,"" ""Super Mario Sunshine,"" ""Mario Party 4,"" ""Mario Party 5"" and ""Mario Kart Double Dash"") don't add much to the franchise, truthfully. The Party games have more minigames, but they still get old quickly. ""Double Dash"" adds nothing of real use -- you could always drive and throw things at the same time; who really cares that now it's separate characters doing the two things? And ""Sunshine"" is one of the most overrated games ever.
The lone Zelda title for GameCube (""The Wind Waker"") was an OK entry in that series, but nowhere near as good as its best (""A Link to the Past,"" for SNES, and ""Ocarina of Time,"" for N64).
""Pikmin"" is a really innovative, cute and entertaining (if frustrating) game. But worth buying a console for? Not really.
Practically all of the other worthwhile games for GameCube are also available for XBox and PS2 (""SSX Tricky,"" ""SSX 3,"" the Simpsons games, ""Gauntlet: Dark Legacy,"" ""Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance,"" etc.) In addition, there are *lots* of games worth playing that are not available on Nintendo, like the Grand Theft Auto games (and many other adult-skewing titles).

Years later, and limited activations have broken the game for me once again.  I gave up trying to get EA to help me after hours of deliberately being dumped in the wrong support queue and/or disconnected.

The good news is, I didn't have to pay much to get the Steam version for my daughter, and so far it's installed and run perfectly fine.  The bad news is, moving your content is still a delicate act of digging in hidden files and hand-copying to multiple locations.  If you're interested in this game today, just be aware that a disc-based version may leave you in the same boat as the many of us who struggled with it the first time around.

Spore is a massive simulated galaxy that allows you the ability to take a life-form from its existence as cellular life to the point of traveling the stars.  To do this you traverse a series of stages, each very interestingly different from the other.  The goal is to come full circle, going from cellular life that erupted from a space meteor, to sentient beings returning to space in their own ships.  Although your opening view is of a galaxy, you then choose a planet to play with, and gameplay focuses on the planet's surface.  Your ""Galaxy"" lets you make many, many planets and play any one of them at any time.  It's also part of a larger ""universe"" online, as you and other players can share each other's creations and try them out on your own worlds.

Life on your world goes through the following stages:  Cellular, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and finally Space.  Along the way through each stage, you can choose how to upgrade your creature by ""calling a mate"":  the offspring are customized by you in the Creature Creator, and they become the creature you play.  As a very clever way of teaching you new features you may have acquired, you play games using your offspring and its mother as she shows you how to use your newfound skills.

All of this is a tremendous amount of fun because a great deal of thought went into making Spore an open system:  your creature has some ingrained behavioral needs (feed, hunt, mate, explore), and other creatures have their own ideas as to what they need to be doing.  Just like you, they can choose whether to be aggressive or friendly, make friends or drive other species to extinction.  The cellular stage plays like an arcade-style game with RPG elements (you can uncover features that you then add to your creature).  Creature stage plays like a platformer, with you wandering the world exploring.  Tribal starts to resemble a Real-Time Strategy, and so on.

That doesn't mean you need to be a veteran gamer to understand Spore:  as you go through the game, Spore is very good about teaching you what you need to know, and never gets so complicated that a child couldn't figure it out.  If you look online, you'll find a lot of fascinating information about how Spore was made, as well as players' videos of gameplay--Spore has integrated into the game the ability to upload your experiences straight to YouTube.

Unfortunately, Spore has been hampered by some bad business decisions.  There's a lot of truth to the stories you're hearing about the copy protection making the game impossible to activate.  I went through many hours of grief and many generic, ""reinstall and write back"" e-mails from tech support before giving in, dialing phone support, and spending half an hour on hold.  It was worth it because the person on the other end was friendly, smart, and extremely helpful.  My EA account was perfectly valid, but there's a problem with EA's many sub-systems:  they simply don't keep themselves in sync, which I've noticed before with other EA titles.  They had to fix the account from their end.

There is also truth to the fact that you are not actually buying this game:  you are buying the right to install and use it on one machine, a certain number of times, provided you properly activate it (using the aforementioned nightmare).  You are also agreeing that you can only reinstall it a small number of times (I think right now EA says it is 3) before it becomes useless.  Which explains why I didn't re-install the game like I was asked to.  After you go over the number of installs, you will have to convince EA to allow you to use the game again--provided they will still honor their agreement or have a way to activate it for you (or the original install is still compatible despite needing to be updated, which is a bigger problem than it may seem).  You should also know that the software may decide you just ""used an install"" if you make changes to your machine, such as upgrading a video card or adding some RAM.  You could easily install this game once and have EA expire your ""install limit"" in the background.

You should also know that the game will not allow you to update it unless you install the EA Download Manager.  The Download Manager will run on your computer in the background unless you disable it, and it will re-enable itself whenever you run Spore.  I don't know what it does, given that most of the time I have to manually instruct it to update my games, but I do know that the updates will be concealed from you and you have to use an interface to run the update:  either in-game or via the download manager, depending on the title.

Overall, Spore has a lot of clever programming, a great openness to it, and an enjoyable interface that makes the game fun for all ages.  Unfortunately, it is a throw of the dice as to whether or not getting it to work will be easy for you.

Life is of little value in this story and even as you liberate areas of enemies the locals continue dying due to animals or their own madmen driving habits.  This island is no enslaved paradise... it's more like purgatory instead.  Luckily the game allows to follow story, liberate areas, or mix it up as you wish.  I did not like the story much, but had fun attacking and controlling enemy camps; which in turn triggered additional side tasking.  Eventually was forced back into story before gaining access to more Southern map areas in need of liberation.

Although much improved from FC2, the story game play feels linear and controlled.  And when you finally get to fight with your major opponents, its a total letdown because they just guide you to press this or that controller button (with screen prompts) and your success depends in quickly doing exactly as prompts tell you.

However, compared to Brotherhood and Revelations the game has left something more to desire.

Instead they've mapped counter to b, which is just plain different from what we've been used to in the earlier games.

The unlocking of weapons not only by rank but by A.C.E.S has made things more interesting.  If you really want a weapon, you either need to find it in game and pick it up (and never replace it until it's unlocked - what I did for my D.Eagle.) or you need to focus on the particular A.C.E.S. type activities to get to that level.

The guns overall are pretty nice, FAMAS is still the noob weapon of choice.  I personally prefer the SCAR-H CQB and the M468, both rock.

Having a silencer on a snipper rifle is also great to have.  Several area's in the game it's a lot easier (and more fun IMHO) to sit back and pick most if not all of the Tango's off one at a time w/o the rest even realizing it.

I like the feel of the mouse. It sits just right in my hand, and the smooth rubber coating just feels nice. The extra button placement is perfect for me. I was worried that it wouldn't be, but the left side buttons fall right under my thumb while the dots per inch adjustments buttons are also easy to toggle with my index finger.

I find the wheel click is too stiff for my liking. I certainly won't click it accidentally. I dealt with this by adding middle click functionality to the extra center button. There are too many lights on this thing, I find it distracting. Thankfully they are easily turned off. I did keep the side one that indicates the current DPI setting.

The software is easy to use (you got to go to the website and download it). It has lots of options, but I was quickly able to find the settings I wanted to adjust. I also didn't need the 5 DPI settings so I disabled 2 of them so they don't show up when i'm switching through them.

I like that the DPI settings don't cycle through. They stop at the lowest or the highest depending on the button being pressed. The DPI buttons are actually a rocker type button forward is faster and backward is slower (this is customize-able if you want it the other way).

Well I was initially a little disappointed and felt that they released the game too early but once I got to tweaking the camera, cinema playback and controller options it solved or eased alot of the problems I was encountering.

I'll keep this short by giveing the good points and bad.
Bad points first. There are frame rate issues if you have the auto cinema feature turned on they can get really bad when a lot of people are on the screen attacking you at one time. If you turn it off you probably won't see a problem with frame rates again.
Second problem is the camera, this can be a problem but you can manually adjust or speed up the auto adjust rate in the options menu and this helps a lot.
Graphically speaking it's a little inconsistent. The particle effects are great but at the same time some of the backgrounds are pretty bland. It's kind of a mixed bag but due to some of the things they've done regarding retaining chopped body parts long after you've left a room in the game it takes a toll on memory usage and thus taxes the 360 quite a bit. Add that to the size of the environments, the number of characters on screen at once and this game pushes the 360 pretty hard.
The other problem though not really a problem, but more of an annoyance is that the enemies are a little on the cheap side this time so you are forced to be a little more creative.

Now for the good:
Believe it or not they have actually improved the gameplay. You start off now with a long list of moves as opposed to hardly any in the original. Countering has been refinded so that you can properly time it. Weapons are now very varied and don't overlap in terms of usage. Enemy AI is incredible you can actually notice the enemies adjusting to your attack patterns. Granted this makes things more difficult but ultimately more satisfying when you win. The level design has gotten rid of a lot of the platforming and focuses much more on the fighting aspect of the game. Secondary weapons are chargable and are actually useful, can anyone actually admit that they used the bow much in the first one?

The story is actually a little more coherent now and makes a bit of sense, though not much. Last but not least It's a great game but a new Missions mode and a little more refinement of the default settings would have made this a classic.",Not a classic but still great,1212710400,18,,

It takes a little while to get going, some of the battles do get repetitive. The exclamations by  the bad guys, blood and gore, and alien language are actually funny and add to the entertainment factor...

What shines in this game are the space battles. I was astonished at how good they were-what I would expect from newer consoles. It makes you wonder how many great sci-fi games there could be out there involving star-wars type battles, which there are not many. But this one hits the mark-it might be the best part of the game.

This is one of the longest campaign games that I can personally remember-which I do like. I cant say how many times I have been really disappointed when I played a game for a week and was done.

+ Improved weaponry, armor, etc.
+ Even more ways to kill Necromorphs
+ Extra difficulty modes of Zealot and Hard Core
+ Extra game ""Dead Space: Extraction"" included

- CONS:

- Has a ""been there, done that"" feeling
- Scare factor is diminished with repeated play-throughs
- Multiplayer can be very frustrating

PLOT:

Dead Space 2 takes place three years after the conclusion of the previous game. Isaac Clarke, our hero, has been reduced to an asylum patient in The Sprawl. Before long, he escapes his confinement and discovers yet another plot by the Unitologists to use him and his Marker-infected mind.

Using his wits, his trusty plasma cutter and some strategic dismemberment, Isaac starts on another journey to eliminate as many Necromorphs as he can.

GAMEPLAY:

As before, we take control of Isaac in a 3rd person, over-the-right-shoulder view. As the game progresses, various weapons and schematics can be found. We can also find power nodes for weapon upgrades, armor upgrades, and more.

We're not confined to the Ishimura anymore, and Isaac has different objectives to complete each level. There isn't as much emphasis on puzzle-solving as we had in the first game...this was dialed back, and the amount of firefights with Necromorphs has clearly increased.

Though it's been 3 years since the last game, Isaac remembers that shots to the body only stun, and even decapitations are ineffective...and in some cases, make Necromorphs more dangerous. He's ready to strategically dismember each enemy until there's nothing left but a bullet-riddled mess.

A power-up called STASIS can be used to freeze Necromorphs while Isaac uses them for target practice/dissection, and another power-up called KINESIS can bring objects to Isaac or hurtle them away with lethal velocity. I LOVED the tweak in gameplay where Isaac can use kinesis to rip a bladed arm off a dead Necromorph, and impale another enemy against the wall with it. This is also a great way to save ammunition.

Players still have the in-game store to buy and sell items; and the upgrade Benches are back to maximize effectiveness for weapons and armor. There's been an additional tweak: if you spend 5000 credits, you can remove all the power nodes from one weapon and assign them to another.

Mercifully, the game still spoon-feeds us objective locations, store locations and save points by using the R3 button.

Dead Space 2 also increased the number of zero-gravity areas, where Isaac can jump off the floor and use suit thrusters to propel him towards his objective.

When you play through this game on the easier settings, you might think you've got it made. However, when you try playing on Zealot mode, that's where you have to carefully plan out each attack so you don't run out of ammunition. Hard Core mode cranks the difficulty level up for seasoned players...you can only save 3 times across the 15 levels of gameplay, and there are no checkpoints. If you die, you go back to your last save point.

MULTIPLAYER:

This is a new addition to Dead Space. These are team-based matches, which last 2 rounds. You can play a Necromorph trying to keep a team of humans from reaching their tactical goals, or you could be a human trying to cleanse a path through a vicious pack of Necromorphs.

HOW ABOUT THAT EXTRA GAME, DEAD SPACE: EXTRACTION?

This was a VERY pleasant surprise. A port from the Nintendo Wii, Extraction takes place prior to the events of the first Dead Space game, and it's played in a first person rail-shooter view. If you don't have a Playstation Move controller, the game can still be played with a DualShock controller. However, since there's virtually no lag while shooting with the Move, that's what I prefer using.

There are 10 levels to play, and there's a large replay value because of all the extra powerups and trophies you can earn. If you're on the fence about buying Dead Space 2, I think this additional game will tip your scales to the ""purchase"" side. You're basically getting 2 full games for the price of one.

TROPHIES:

Trophy lovers, now is the time to REJOICE. Dead Space 2 has 51 trophies to earn (8 more if you purchase the DLC pack), and Dead Space Extraction offers 48 additional trophies.

Many of the trophies are earned for completing chapters of the game, using certain weapons to kill Necromorphs, and so forth.

Without a doubt, the hardest trophy to earn is to complete the game on the ""Hard Core"" difficulty setting. You can only save 3 times throughout the course of the entire game. Your skills will be pushed to the ultimate limits, as well as your patience. If you manage to complete this task, you are rewarded with a ridiculously overpowered weapon that will make all subsequent playthroughs as easy as falling off a log.

CONS:

The first Dead Space game had a very, VERY claustrophobic feel to it. The creaking of the ship's deck plates, the sound of Isaac's breathing, the sharp music changes when a Necromorph appeared, it was all designed to scare us to our core.

Even though I enjoyed Dead Space 2, I didn't get the same sense of all-encompassing fear as I did when I played the first game. There weren't many new monsters, and most of the fetch-questing was toned down in favor of more face-to-face combat. To me, it simply felt less scary and more predictable. I found the scare factor diminished with each New Game+.

The weakest part of Dead Space 2, by far, was the Multiplayer mode. In a nutshell, you play as either a Necromorph or a human. Humans will regenerate at one central spawn point, but if playing as a Necromorph, you can choose where you want to emerge from.
The problem is, the spawning is so slow that it paints a bulls-eye on your face while your online opponents turn you into hamburger.
Powerups can be earned as you accumulate experience points, which in turn increases your attack damage, but the matching of players is completely random and unbalanced. I played with a couple of other people that were levels 3 to 10, but a few of my opponents were upwards of level 20-30...This was the same problem with Multiplayer matches in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TRON-Evolution/dp/B004Y3D2JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TRON: Evolution</a>. I found the Necromorphs were very slow and clunky to control - instead of performing a slashing attack, I usually ended up jumping up and down in front of my opponents.

FINAL VERDICT?

While I enjoyed the harder difficulty settings and the addition of Dead Space: Extraction in this package, I didn't find myself as scared. Killing Necromorphs and upgrading my weapons and armor was fun, but the fear factor and the puzzle gameplay definitely felt like they were dialed back. I didn't get much enjoyment out of the multiplayer mode, but to each their own. However, if you like killing Necromorphs, you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of Dead Space 2.",Isaac is at it again...,1369526400,3,,

Personally I prefer the sticks to be asymmetrical so that gave it a step up on the DS4.  The sticks are also very rubbery so the grip is fantastic! The stick resistance is in between DS4 and an Xbox one so I found it to be perfect.  The button to slow down the stick speed is great for precision shots at long range.

The only things I didn't care for was the triggers/bumpers.  The bumpers are odd shaped but very responsive, the triggers though are more like buttons, which is ok but I found that once in a while I would stop firing in a game cause I didn't have the button pressed hard enough. The other thing is there is no gyroscope, so you can't use it for games like Detroit: Become Human.  Not many games use it, but it prevents this from being the ""be all end all"" controller.

I believe this game has been rated low only because it is compared to closely to Mario galaxy when in reality while it did borrow a few things from that game it is more like Sonic Xtreme which was sadly never released.

 I have heard from some that the Wii U version is better and some say the 3ds version is better however I do not own a Wii U so I can't compare so if you plan to only get one version you may have to do some research. A lot of the critics say this game is slow and sure the did tone it down a little bit from the more recent sonic 3d games which was hold the boost button for an hour tell you reach the end but the game is still fast my only problem with it though if your running you have to hold the R button but it goes about as fast as the old school genesis games. That and obviously the critics have not played sonic labyrinth cause that game was a lot slower then this one. (and that game was horrible)

 The levels are set up like the original Sonic which was 3 acts and then a boss. The sonic games were never really very hard but this one goes all out with the difficulty probably in my opinion on of the most challenging sonic games (except for the gamegear games the were brutal) and I've beat them all on the genesis (spinball included). So kids and casual gamers might have a little trouble playing threw it unless the sit down long enough to learn it or use the gadgets. Also the soundtrack is styled after the classic sonics so no crush 40 style music as from what I've played so far but the classic styled soundtrack is original music and is more fitting in sonic games in my opinion and I guarantee you will be humming along with half the songs in the game.

 The story is very light in the game but I never played sonic games for the story either but the cutscenes are nice and the voice acting is not gonna win any awards but for a sonic game there nice very saturday morning cartoon styled.  My only problem with this game is the way the Time limit is set up. You may start with 20 mins (which most hardcore sonic fans will be mad about) but you will need every second on these levels that and if you die that clock continues to count down making death very punishable. Other than that small gripe though if your a fan of the original Sonic games then you need to pick this game up you will not regret it if your new to the sonic series I would still recommend this but I would recommend playing an earlier sonic title like Advance (if you have a gameboy) or the genesis titles which is available on just about anything these days first because of the difficulty.",Ignore the critics this game is amazing,1383350400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"09 3, 2001",A26PAN8REXYBYH,B00002SUOV,Brian M. Ranzoni,"Having heard about *Payne* since my early Navy days, I went out to Fred Meyers electronic department last Tuesday and bought it. Over two long nights and part of Thursday afternoon, I beat it. Sucked in from the moment I saw the box art, I refused to escape this game. With few exceptions, four years of development show in *Max Payne*.
Produced by 3D Realms, *Max Payne* is a third-person shoot through a noir-choked New York City. Finnish developer Remedy follows the standard set by Valve to immerse the game in an actual plot, bloody and surreal. We begin with our hero at the end of a vengeful rampage, and his reflections are the game. One fine American day, Detective Payne comes home in time to hear drug-crazed loonies shoot his wife and child. He hunts each intruder down, but too late. Payne joins his buddy Alex in the DEA. The killers had flown high on Valkyr, a new designer drug, and after three hard years the pair finally discovers the prime dealersa debased and savage crime syndicate. But the break bursts bigger than anyone could imagine: hitmen ambush Max and Alex during a subway meeting. Max survives, but somebody out there is determined, powerful, and sadistic: Max is quickly framed for killing his own friend. As a terrible blizzard sets over New York, cold rage sets on Max. His enemies think he is trapped and helplessthey only free his trigger finger
As the player, I turn Paynes predicament into an opportunity for revenge. But not all is grit and gloom. *Payne* parodies itself along the way, relieving its own pain through the medicine of laughter. Much of the story unfolds in a wonderfully dark and sour graphic novel. Frozen in pictures made to resemble watercolor panels, actors pose comically, goofy expressions across their faces. Voice acting accompanies the novel scenes with such delicious ham I wanted to eat it. As the voice of pain himself, James McCaffrey deadpans morbid metaphor after sanguine simile after killer comeback. After criticizing the insanity of a mob boss, Payne broods, But who was I to talkan underdog avenger alone against an empire of evil, out to right a grave injustice? In the action itself, the player will stumble across nods to *Pulp Fiction*, *Die Hard*, *Lethal Weapon*, *Batman*, *The Punisher*, and *The Killer*. Foes scream hysterically as they die. And wisely borrowing from *No One Lives Forever*, Remedy peppers the game with the conversations of its guards, like Why are vampire movies always set in LA? They cant get a suntan!
All of this humor works against the very un-funny circumstance of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome. One must actually play through Paynes nightmares and hallucinations; the experience is as frightening as any horror movie. But filling the hole of a dead wife and child is a revenge-sodden plot, with the contrast between humor and horror keeping the atmosphere balanced.
Play is balanced as much as plot. Every time the game is booted up, the player has the option of customizing performance: textures, decals, sounds and frames. The software is also apparently able to recognize when the player cuts through the opposition like Deaths scythe, and when the opposition crumples the player-scythe like tinfoil. The stamina and aim of everybody is accordingly adjusted. *Payne* provides no armor, but introduces a Sam Peckinpah-style slow motion to give the player a stunt edge. Named after a special effect in *The Matrix*, this bullet time allows Max to shoot and dodge in slow motion, but aim in real time. Speaking of bullets, *Payne* bristles with contemporary crime movie weapons, including: Ingram M11s, Beretta 92s, and sawed-off shotguns straight out of *The Untouchables*. No bazookas, BFGs, or similar and unnecessary anti-tank weapons exist. Each level is exotic, moody-- and yet realistic (a multilevel parking garage has fluorescent lights and white-washed walls straight out of Navy boot campugh). *Paynes* puzzles and mazes are simple, subtle, and justified with snowstorms and mob wars keeping things in perspective.
A proper perspective recognizes quirks as well as qualities. Despite four years to perfect it, a few noticeable flaws prevent *Max Payne* from receiving my five-star approval. Max can crouch, but he cannot creepinstead he automatically stands up and jogs. This makes things easier on the level designer, but harder on Max when he steps around a doorframe and gets shot in the face. Max also doesnt climb anything other than stairs, which again benefits the designer more than Max. While Payne is obviously meant to be a lone-wolf, it would have added to the suspension-of-belief if the levels were populated with friendly New York bums, bartenders, and bus drivers hiding from the snow. Finally, some of the levels felt a lot like those in Ravens *Soldier of Fortune*, but given the location, I think the similarities are unavoidable.
Strangest of all to me is the content-line Remedy seems to have drawn for itself. No child should play Max Payne as it is, but the game is not nearly as explicit as many classics. The bloody chum found in *Quake*, *Half-Life*, and *Soldier of Fortune* puts Payne to shame. Swearing limits mostly to blasphemies, as *Payne* avoids words even network television slips in. While Max investigates houses, we see just one prostitute, and one gambler. *Duke Nukem 3D* has more pornography, foul language, and gore in the first two levels of the shareware version than all of *Payne*. The only illegal drug mentioned or seen is the fictional Valkyr.
But I can easily understand if content is traded for style or performance (or both). Remedys *Max Payne* provides active and balanced story and game-play. Its faithful film-noir atmosphere makes the player imagine more grit than is actually shown. Only its neglect of a few basics prevent a full rating.

It's just, not that many games specifically support it's features. To be sure, this thing is just a controller so it will work with any game, but it's missing two buttons and the analog sticks (except for left and right via the gyroscope). I'm not saying this because I tried to play GTA with it or something, but because some driving games might become unplayable with this wheel. Driver San Francisco uses the right analog stick to seek out and find a new care to possess. This is a core mechanic of that game and it can't be done with the move wheel. That being said, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit is also not designed with the move wheel in mind but it handles beautifully. It's fun just to drive on free roam with this thing. Something else to notice is that, competitively, the wheel makes it harder to drive, but that's not a bad thing. It's harder because it's more realistic in that you have to turn a physical object, whereas before you flicked a controller.

Oddly enough, Motorstorm Apocalypse DOES support the move wheel but it is so much worse to play it that way. It's so slippery and hard to control compared to a controller, and for some reason it requires you to use the playstation camera.

It is almost like a membrane keyboard , except the following travel distance is less mushy and very quick.
-The lighting on the keyboard is gorgeous
-The media control keys are very handy
-The cord is low-profile and braided
-The keyboard is very compact for a full-size keyboard.

Cons:
-The Romer-G keyswitches have a springy echo whenever the switch is bottomed out
-The spacebar on my model rattles a lot.
-The coating on the keycaps wear off quickly. I already see wear on my spacebar after a week of use. After the coating wears off, the transparent keycap is revealed. This makes the keyboard look very dirty and ugly.

It is a common problem, and you can read about all the woes on the internet. Most of the proposed solutions fall into one of two camps.  1) Buy a new drum set.  2) Get out your soldering gun and prepare to do some home electrical repair.

I didn't like either of these options, as I have neither the money for a new drum set nor a soldering gun (nor electrical repair skills).  But I took a gamble on this replacement wire, figuring it was cheap enough to give it a try. And if it fixed the problem, all the better.

Swapping out the cord was not as easy as I thought.  This isn't a ""plug-and-play"" official replacement part.  It involves taking apart the entire drum set, and mucking about with the circuit boards a bit, and a fair spread of time. There are no directions, but it is easy enough to follow where the new cord is supposed to go, but you have to be careful.  I bent the wires the first time I tried to attach it, and I was afraid that I had accidently destroyed the whole thing.

Even lacking skills, I managed to get the new cord attached, and the drum set back together.  And what do you know?  The orange cymbal works again!  I was shocked, but happy.

Cons:  Sound can be a bit too ""crisp"" without adequate bass to offset.  Also, these are wired, and there are a lot of wires.  Wire to my USB port. Wire to my headphone jack/optical input.  Wire to my microphone jack.  Another wire back to my headphone from the sound control unit, which is the surround sound decoder.  Heavy bundle of extra, bundled up headphone cord, plus an in-line amplifier box. All these wires make these a bit bulky. Also, only two speakers here - does not have true Dolby 5.1 Headphone output.

Review:  The X-Tatic SR's draw power through USB, which is good.  I hate changing batteries all the time.  This requires an extra wiring solution for Ipads that of course do not have a USB port, but realistically I think these headphones would be too bulky to use with an Ipad if you are on the move.  There are just too many wires for such a use I think.  For straight up gaming, it is less of an issue because most surround sound type headphones come with a lot of wires anyway.

As long as you have an optical output on your device, you can have digital audio support with these headphones.  If not, you can still use them just fine with the standard connection cord.  There is a separate box between your device and the headphones called the Sound Control Unit.  The SR's support Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Pro Logic 2, and regular Dolby Headphone.  While the SCU will recognize and decode a Dolby Digital 5.1 input signal, the output to the headphones is not Dolby Digital 5.1.  There are not multiple speakers embedded in each ear cup like with true 5.1 headphones.  There are only two speakers #one in each earcup#, so what you get is more a simulation of 5.1 than true 5.1.  There is also no subwoofer.

That said, the sound output is still very high quality.  There is an in-line amplifier between the headphones and the SCU box, and the SCU box also has a ""3D Expander.""  I turned the expander off and on over and over again and could not detect a lick of difference in sound or surround effect, but it could just be me.  The SCU itself has 4 buttons: a power switch, two volume controls #which are sort of redundant since there is an in-line volume control present on the amplifier#, and a third button that toggles you from ""gaming mode"" to ""music mode"" or just plain ole stereo mode.  You monitor the different modes via light displays on the SCU, but with 4 lights that display differently depending on your mode #gaming, music, etc.# this isn't as clear as it should be.  The music mode does sound really good though, which is surprising because most gaming headphones are poor for music.  The fact that music sounds so good on these is a testament to the overall sound quality of these headphones.  If you want a really crisp sound where you can hear an in-game mouse creeping along 40 feet behind you and to the right, you will really like these headphones.  The positional audio is quite good and accurate.  I am using these for BF 3 on the PC, and the headphones are really showing what they can do.  The sound in BF3 is stunning, and these headphones take full advantage of the positional audio and booming explosions.  The surround effect is very pronounced and I often catch myself feeling like I am really in a war zone with all the distant sound effects.  When a helicopter flies over or around me in the game you can hear the sound circle or pass over head like you would in the real world.  Truly a game where the audio makes a huge difference and this headset brings it all home.  I personally think they would benefit from a bit more bass response, however.  I normally use other subwoofer headphones that really sound great for shooting and explosions, but the crispness is typically lacking in such headsets.  I also recently purchased the Ear Force X12 headset, which has pretty good bass.  So clearly, I prefer heavy bass which may not be as important to you.  Truth be told, too much bass would overwhelm all the subtle audio clues in a game like BF3.  So, when I mention the bass with these headphones, keep in mind I am not dinging them in any, I just thought I would mention it for the benefit of any other bass hounds out there.  I expect you will appreciate the sound of the SR's, but if you like really heavy bass, just know it is present, just not overwhelming like with a subwoofer headset.

The microphone is detachable, which is nice because I prefer to not have it connected when I am playing a single player game.  The mike connects to an Xbox 360 through the controller, and a playstation 3 through USB for power and sound at the same time.  It also comes with a 3.5 mm stereo cable, a stereo extension cable, an optical connection cable #S/PDIF#, a USB 2.0 cable and a G6 adapter cable. Every cable you could possibly need to connect to your device is included. #which I expect also contributes to the cost#

A really nice touch is the ability to connect a second, separate headset.  There is an extra 3.5mm audio jack on the SCU so a buddy can plug in and share audio for coop gaming, or so you can share music with a friend.  The headphones are comfortable and made of quality materials with quality construction.  I wouldn't mistreat them of course, but they don't appear so fragile that I feel the need to cradle them like a baby or an egg, as I have done with past headphones.

I don't view these as inexpensive as there is no shortage of gaming headphones in the $30-$100 range.  There are also, however, even more expensive surround sound headphones that have multiple speakers in each ear cup.  In the end, we spend money on what matters to us, whether it is speakers, the latest cell phone, tech gadgets, or gaming headphones.  I expect you won't spend this kind of money on a pair of gaming headphones unless you are seriously into your gaming audio and really want some accurate positional audio for multi-player gaming.  If that is the case, you will certainly get what you pay for with these headphones. The sound is pretty amazing, especially for gaming. If you have a gamer (PC, xbox, PS 3, Ipad) to buy for this holiday season, they will certainly be impressed with these headphones.",Nice positional audio for the money,1316649600,,,

I'm sorry, but that's the way, most of the games I run into are. The game has silky-smooth graphix and rocky-rough animation, meaning the characters and areas are beautiful, but the the moving sprites seem to use only two frames of animation per task (running to an enemy and then whacking it are 2 different tasks). Thankfully, the Full-Motion-Video cutscenes are done well considering that they're Anime-style.
The gameplay is great most of the time but -you guessed it- gets excruciatingly difficult at innapropriate times. Try fighting your very first enemy and you'll probably see what I mean.
The storyline is set approximately 1000 years after the first game, give or take a few months, and your center of control is a slightly-less-annoying-than-Alex little brat who goes by the name of Hiro. The blue-haired girl in the maroon cloak and baret is Lucia, an alien sorcoress you have no control over even in battle mode. The pink cat-like creature (who will try to tear your face off if you call her a cat to her face) is Ruby, a baby dragon with a smartmouth whom you'll either learn to love or hate throughout the game. The good news is that Ruby is more helpful than Nall, Alex's pet dragon from the first game because Ruby actually attacks enemies where-as Nall only healed fallen allies randomly. The story itself revolves around Hiro trying to help Luna (who suffered from amnesia) find her true self while investigating strange activities by the Goddess Althena.
Hardcore fans of Lunar: The Silver Star Story will be happy to know that there will be at least two returning characters (three if you count Althena herself) but alas I cannot tell you who they are or my review may not be approved by the Amazon staff.

The sword fighting, the moves and camera work etc.  look cool. Altair (your character) looks cool.  Getting to the point, every detail seems to incorporate the rules of design (rhythm, motion, scale, harmony, balance, tension, etc.) sorry- art major speaking.

The Good: It looks good, we know that, but the gameplay is innovative and fun.  There's a button for the legs, a button for each hand, and one for the head. I rarely feel like I have to reach or move the controller in some odd way to do something quickly- except for weapon switching, which we'll get to in the bad.  Combo's are easy to pull off and always look awesome. Kills are also immensely satisfying.  The blade goes through them and comes out covered in blood, not to mention the sound effects. The cities are vast and interesting to navigate.  You'll find yourself constantly wondering ""street or rooftops, how to get back up, where are the hide spots, were are the helpers, how do I escape...""and so on. the AI provides a few original and interesting aspects.  Streets are literally packed with NPCs and its your job to sort pick out the troublemakers, navigate them.  I've had to not-so-stealthily kill more than a few beggars and drunks.  All of this incorporates into the assassinations,  and that's the real key of the game.

the bad: This game made the same mistake (though not nearly as badly) as Shadow of Colossus.  It gives you a great big beautiful world with some really fun missions and nothing in between. There are missions in-between assassinations, but they're all pretty much the same thing. Scale the tower, stealthily kill some guards, pickpockets, eavesdrop and fight without your plethora of pointy things.  Where's the busty barkeep needing someone to usher her landlord off the mortal coil? Where's the guy who wants that exceptionally fast horse that some exceptionally tough knight happens to own? Glitches are also a problem- Though not to the point that they make you not want to play anymore.  Sometimes you get stuck between things. It usually spits you back out though.  I had one assassination where I couldn't hide because the pile of hay or whatever wouldn't let me out.  Godness (not goodness) slaughtering a whole battalion of gaurds is nothing.  Slaughtering a city full is time consuming.  The enemies get some new abilities, but for the most part- R1  - square and you perform some sweet looking critical damage. weapon switching!!! grr!!  all your weapons are on the directional buttons- a minor pain to get to in a pinch- yet the L1, L2, L3 and R3 go unused! gah!

Overall I liked this game a lot.  Did it live up to the hype?  Missed it by this ()much.  Replay is kind of nil once you know what the story is. Unless, perhaps,  you're a bit OCD and must get 100% completion at all costs.  is it worth the money? yeah, I think it is, and I paid the $60 for it new. Why would anyone keep it around with so little replay value?  Use it to show off your new HDTV and stuff, of course!

The combat is bad, especially at first when you don't have enough XP to level up your gun accuracy. The graphics are strange, being really high resolution, yet primitive at the same time. Many cant overlook these problems... but here's the kicker

This game is amazing. The story starts off interestingly enough, but it keeps getting better and better. Your main character is a spy, never before has your dialogue choices felt soooo meaningful. This game puts Bioware games to shame in regards to dialogue and there consequences of your actions. Friends can become enemies, enemies friends! You can talk people into betraying the main bad guy, you can JOIN the main bad guy. Making someone like you, is NOT always the best option, sometimes you might want someone to hate you, to have a personal vendetta against you so he fights you to his last, allowing you to kill him, otherwise he'll run away.

The RPG aspect is also very cool, leveling up hand to hand, stealth, guns, gadgets and technical skills, mechanical skills, and 3 different types of armor you can buy and upgrade giving you 3 unique play style options. You can make your guy super sneaky, give him the top tier sneak armor and level up hand to hand and make him play like... Bat Man, punching and choking people out. OR say eff it, and grab heavy armor, going in loud and proud, only changing your assault strategy to beating them senseless when you want to avoid casualties (my favorite way to play)

Which brings up ANOTHER issue... the game takes note of who you kill and DONT kill. If you do a mission racking up bodies, make sure you want to be seen as an opperative that kills those types of people. Are they Islamic extremists literally no one in the game would care about? Are they a rogue intelligence operation who you actually want to get on your side? Mercenaries? Russian thugs? A BOSS character who would return several times in the story even be called upon to save your ass at times?

I had been eying HOMEFRONT ever since it was announced in late spring of 2010. The story intrigued me it looked like it would be a great game. because I was not familiar with the developer (Company of heroes was the only game by THQ that I have and I had never even heard of Kaos studios before) I did not pre order it or buy it in the first few days. after reading the reviews I decided to wait for the price to come down and I did finally get it for $20.00 in early June 2011.

The single player is well done but is also rather short(I beat the second hardest of 4 difficultly levels in about 6 hours) but what single player there was was pretty good. Much of what makes the single player so exciting is the shock value of it, there were times when something would happen and I am just thinking did that really just happen. On the difficulty level that I played on I found it very challenging, much more so than veteran on Call of duty, but not as hard as Half life 1.  the environment is very well done and at times very is disturbing. Another thing that was fascinating in this game is the amount of back story in the game, for me this makes it a lot more convincing and I also think that they did a very good job of making it believable.  Many of the things that the Koreans do are also really unsettling. There is a seen in the beginning of the game ware two people are executed in front of their child and the child screams and it is quite unsettling. In general the biggest weakness of this game is its short length. Also the weapons sounds, the guns do not sound like real guns and it really takes a lot out of the game.  Overall I really liked the single player but I did get really annoyed with the number of profanities that were used. one more point I want to make is that the graphics do seem sub par, they look like what would have been ground breaking in 2006 but for 2011 they are barley exceptable.

The multi-player was really good. The maps were large but not to large. I never had a problem with people camping. the vehicle system was way better than in battlefield. it is very much a hybrid of battlefield and COD. the classes are customizable with weapon attachments, camouflages, and perks.  one thing that is really cool is the fact that the objectives switch witch means that there are never any kill zones ware if you go you will die instantly. another thing that is cool in this game is that if you get a kill streak than you are labeled as a priority threat and players on the other team will be told ware you are. the more kills you get than the more enemies know your location but you also get some reward for getting kill streaks like UAV scans and extra ammo etc.this feature helps to keep people from getting enormous kill streaks like in MW2 , this makes the game a bit more n00b friendly but is still harder than CoD.  The final thing that makes this game cool is the battle points system. battle points are earned by killing enemies, capturing points and getting assists. you can use these points to buy tanks, hummvees, helicopters etc. or to get things like RPGs, flack jackets, or UAV missiles.  The biggest problem with the multi player is that there is NO BULLET PENETRATION AT ALL! this means that you can hide behind a wooden fence and not get killed. If HOMEFRONT fixes that problem than it might be able to challenge Call of Duties dominance as an online shooter.

The final thing that I want to say is that this game has a general lack of content. There are not a lot of guns, there are not a lot of maps, and there are not a lot of game modes. This means that the game is not worth $49.99. I am very happy with it though because I only paid $19.99 for it. if you can get it cheap than I recommend it but if not than get something else.

I didn't get far and the game received mixed reviews so I don't regret not finishing it. The first Silent Hill game I completed was Silent Hill: Homecoming, which I loved and played many times.

So when I heard that this collection was coming, I was very excited and eager to pick it up. As you may know, there are two separate games included in here, Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3. Both games look pretty good, considering that they are pretty damn old. The camera is very reminiscent of the old Resident Evil camera (static) and somewhat annoying but not broken. The controls are similar, not great but will not hinder you too much.

Many people complain about glitches that are never going to be patched, I guess I'm lucky, as I have not had any issues with my game and it plays, sounds and controls flawlessly (or as flawless as it could be seeing as how they are older games). Both games actually have re-done voices, but keep the original in the game, in case you want them instead.

Every car handles differently, every course is linked together in one massive world, and the controls will take you back to the days of arcade racers like Daytona USA. (Actual arcade racers - the ones with $5,000 cabinets all arcade owners dreaded purchasing.) The customization features are a little shallow, and the game is a little easy. Okay, a lot easy. But you'll love the ride while it lasts, and you're going to want to play through this racer more than once.

Graphics: 8

The cars look amazing. Every part of them is packed with realistic detail. Even the interiors are noticeably accurate. The cars reflect the city lights quite beautifully, and will do so differently depending on the type of finish that's been applied (chrome, matte, etc.).

Carbon's environments aren't nearly as memorable. The backgrounds aren't that far beyond what was possible with the old Xbox. Also, the cars, as gorgeous as they are, cannot be damaged. They can crash repeatedly, and abolish generic police vehicles. But your vehicles - which are from licensed manufacturers - are as protected as those in Gran Turismo, save for a few scratches every now and then (that magically disappear after every race).

I know that this is what most, not all, automakers want. But if some manufacturers are on board and others are not, maybe it's the supportive companies you should be focusing on - to give the gamer the most intense experience possible.

Sound: 7.9

Hurray for the return of full-motion video! First you get to see the actors, who look toward the camera when talking to the player's character as if you were actually in the story. The actors also appear in polygon form, with extreme realism to boot. Their polygon expressions are a little better than their real expressions, mainly due to the real actors' lack of believability.

The voices - they're better than most, but have a hint of ""video game syndrome."" It looks like a bunch of actors were hired to be in a video game. It doesn't look or sound like they were hired to be in a professionally written story. Which isn't too surprising. Carbon's characters only have one theme: ""take my city and I'll hate you forever"" (an exaggerated but truthful interpretation).

Difficulty: Easy/Medium

Most Career mode races can be won on the first try. The external challenge mode provides additional races to conquer, but they're not enough to boost this game's difficulty.

Concept: 7.5

It's Need For Speed all over again. I'm not about to be one of those crazy people who say the series needs an overhaul to be great again. It doesn't. I love the direction the developers have taken. That said, it's not an original direction, just one of polish. But this series is meant to be a certain way. To make it original again would likely eliminate all the things we love.

Multiplayer: 8

Four for co-op; eight for multiplayer via Xbox Live. Some of the Career mode races are playable online as well for added challenges.

Overall: 8.2

A throwback to the good old, worry-free days of arcade racing. This is the kind of game you'll play after seeing The Fast and the Furious (or any other street racing flick). You might hate that series - you might think the third Furious is the worst movie ever made.

Super Princess Peach for the DS finds the usual damsel in distress in the hero role this time as she's on a mission to save Mario and Luigi from evil clutches.  The game looks like a typical 2-D side scroller featuring Peach, but there is a bit of a change up in gameplay thanks to some of Peach's special powers.  Peach has something called a vibe meter, which depending on how you use it can perform different abilities based on her emotions.  While this adds a nice new dimension to the tried but true gameplay, Super Princess Peach fails to live up to the Super Mario Bros. level of excellence.  This is because the game is way too easy to breeze through, and the levels themselves are relatively simple to navigate as well.  The lack of challenge hurts the game, but there's enough redeeming factors here that help make it a very good game.  After defeating Bowser, bonus levels are unlocked that do offer a bit of challenge that add to an already solid game length, and the game has a charming, colorful look to it to boot.  All that help elevate Super Princess Peach above the pack of side scrolling adventures for the DS, but the game is ultimately disappointing for hardcore Mario fans or gamers looking for something challenging.

4.0,False,"02 14, 2005",A2G83QW4O38F8U,B00029QR8I,Nicholas J. Delillo,"Sid Meier is a genius.  Whenever you see his name on the front of a computer game box, you know the game is going to keep one philosophy in mind:  Fun first.  It's a GAME.

Happily, that philosophy is in full effect for Sid Meier's Pirates!.  A Pirate-simulation game that oozes fun, cheesy stereotypes, and Yo! Ho!Ho!  all over it, that I would not have been surprised if Johnny Depp appeared somewhere in the game.  In multiple interviews, Sid Meier has repeatedly stated that during the design of a game, whenever realism of a setting and fun gameplay conflict in a gaming decision, fun always is selected.  Good for him.  Leave the reality to whatever edition of Flight Simulator is out this week.

The game uses a story of the wrongful imprisonment of your family to seek vengeance for the injustices imposed on them and you.  As fate would have it (and as it is explained in the opening cut scenes of the game), your mission of vengance leads you to the command of your own vessel in the caribbean.  But who cares?  It's pirate time!  And what a great time it is.

The gameplay is similar to the real-time simulated worlds observed in Grand Theft Auto, where life goes on whether you participate or not.  You can go anywhere.  Trade with anyone.  Attack any ship.  Plunder the caribbean.  Charm the hearts of several governor's daughters.  Seek buried treasure.  Become the most feared pirate in the seven seas.  A respected trader.  A hero in one country, an outlaw in another.  All at the same time.  There's swashbucklling swordfights! Ship to ship battles! Become an admiral, a nobleman, perhaps governor of your own town.  If not, that town can be attacked and plundered by your crew anyway. There was something else...oh yes, revenge for your family. Well, you can get to that eventually.  Or not, it's your choice. Right now, the beautiful governor's daughter in Santiago needs wooing at the next ball, right after you use that map you bought in VeraCruz to dig up blackbeard's hidden treasure.

As you can tell, I love this game.  It comes from a simpler time, where games were made simply for the buyer to enjoy, not suffer through. The graphics are beautiful, the art design captures the romanticized version of pirate life perfectly, the sounds and music are not just perfect, they are appropriately timed.

The only con I have for this game is the lack of a tutorial.  However, the game is so easy to learn and play, it is quite forgivable.  The other problem is the occasional crash to desktop.  It's not too big a deal thoug, because the auto-save feature and the ability to quick-save anywhere when sailing minimizes this flaw.

One ""flaw"" that many reviewers seem to point out is the repetitiveness of the gameplay.  I'm sorry, but I don't see that as a flaw.  Do you repeat several actions?  Sure do.  Are certain cut scenes replayed over and over again? Of course!  But I don't find the overall gameplay repetitive, because MOST games have repetitive gameplay.  Think about it:  How many games of Madden football look and play exactly alike? All those fighting games break down to the same few moves for each character. And every shooter out there has one core repetitive feature:  point gun, shoot.  Sid Meier's Pirates!  also has repetitive actions, but includes a dynamic caribbean setting that changes based on the way you play.  You may perform the same actions in a swordfight or dance, but I guarantee no 2 games will play out the same.  You can start your career sailing under the flag of one of several nationalities, you can change the beginning skill of your hero, there are several time settings used for the caribbean that change the overall starting point for each nation, and the end result of the gameplay is up to you.  There is no set goal.  You can save your family or not.  Retire as a swashbuckler or the hero of a nation.  Doesn't sound repetitive to me.  The only game that comes close to this is another pirate game, Port Royale 2.  Although Port Royale 2 has even more options available, the complexity of the gameplay minimizes the sheer fun available.  If you want a complex 17th century caribbean merchant/pirate simulator, try out Port Royale 2.  If you are in the minority of gameplayers that can handle it, congratulations.  If you are like most of us, and want a pirate game that allows you to enjoy the setting, is simple to learn and play, adds plenty of depth and variety to enrich the experience but never sinks you in details, then Pirates! is for you.  Generally, if you are tired of the same old shooters, too full of themselves RPGs, strategy games that require a PhD to understand how to play, this game is right up your alley.  Easy to learn, nothing to master,  just plenty to enjoy.",Sid Meier has done it again,1108339200,13,,

Dante adds a lot of replay value as he has 4 diff fighting styles and 3-4 diff swords.  I can't wait to replay this on a higher difficulty and try different combos out.  The boss battles are the funnest part of the game.  Regarding the backtracking you experience with Dante, it's not that bad as it goes pretty quickly, but it would've been nice to see new settings.

This is my first DMC game and I'm halfway through it. I saw the commercial for this a couple months ago and thought it was more of the same old same old so I passed it up.  Well, I wound up picking up a used copy now that they've come down in price and am I ever glad I did. I've finished the original Ninja Gaiden on Xbox and really enjoyed that, but never replayed it because the environments were too eclectic for me--nothing was cohesive or made sense.  The environments in this game are really nice as you fight in castles, forest, snow...some parts even seem ethereal. But what gives this game replay value is the combo system.  It mainly revolves around hitting your opponent in the air, further flailing away at him before pulverizing him into the ground.  It's a familiar formula but what's innovative in this game, is that you have a gun that helps keep you aloft, and a devil hand that just punishes your enemies. The devil hand is really innovative as you can pull enemies towards you or pull yourself to them, and it unleashes wicked attacks on different enemies and bosses, which never get old.

The graphics are definitely HD, but not photo-realistic.  It's what you would expect from a Capcom game as are the menu interfaces.  Some may find the puzzles a little challenging but they are not too too difficult (I'm still playing on easy). I still haven't played the 2nd character yet so that should add more variety in terms of gameplay, but I'm already impressed and look forward to playing the game, which is what it's all about.  So if you like games like Ninja Gaiden and God of War, you should like this.

notes: There are a lot of cutscenes which you can bypass, but they are really well done. The camera sucks at times but aren't a dealbreaker.  Skills and abilities need to be bought and it seems you'll never accumulate enough for everything. You can also rev your sword like a motorcycle (aside: I have an '07 R1, which is the most reliable/best looking bike ever, imho) making it glow red hot and when attacking will emit flames.  You can only save after you finish a level, but when you die fighting a boss, you continue right there; I was initially concerned about having to replay the entire level, but that's not the case.  Definitely a buy if you can get it for around $20.",Great hack and slash game,1214784000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

If you're anywhere close to being an adult (or teenager...or maybe even 10), then this game will likely be way too easy and boring for you.  There are tons of checkpoints on each level, and if you die, you just respawn at the checkpoint (seriously...you can't go 10 seconds without going over the next checkpoint).

You play most of the levels as Jedi, but there are a number of Clone Trooper levels, too (which I think are more fun).  Each level is fairly short, so it's like bite sized Star Wars.  My son has no trouble playing on the normal levels, but he wouldn't be able to pass the boss levels on his own.

anyway, this was one of the launch titles for the gamecube if i'm not mistaken. i can see why it was chosen for launch. it's a fairly quick (about 6 hours), easy game (some of the bad guys don't even hurt you) that showcased the gamecube's improved graphics and it's new control pad. the game makes a lot of use of the gamecube's c-stick as a quasi second analog which controls luigi's aim and the direction he's facing.

the game involves luigi searching for mario in a mansion haunted by ghost and in particular, 'boo's (the fat, round goofy-looking ghost with teeth). armed with a ghostbuster style vacuum, the poltergust 3000 and a flashlight, luigi captures 'boo's in order to weaken their powers and save mario.

all in all, this game is fun, not too incredibly difficult and would've had nice potential for a more developed sequel they made for the 3ds. i like seeing a mario game outside of the norm. the final boss, king boo (which i guess is the main bad guy of the game) is pretty cool and should be developed to be used in other games.",luigi's the other half of gamecube's janitorial duo,1445299200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So 10 years later, the game that started this trendy era of COD games is just as I figured it would be, a FPS juggernaut masterpiece. Of the 3 Modern Warfare games in it's trilogy (2007-2011), this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

I remember back when I was in High School in '07 and when I read reviews for this on IGN, Gamespot and so on, I couldn't bear to understand why is every gamer and critic was praising Modern Warfare 1 giving it all straight 5 out of 5s and 10/10s. Now I know why, you would think after 2006's Call of Duty 3 (PS2/Xbox/PS3/Xbox360/PC/Wii), gamers were starting to get bored and tired of war based games being in focus of covering WWII well this game changed the landscape of this just like how Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight changed the landscape of superhero cinema and how Michael Bay's first Transformers film (same year this game came out) changed the way how dumb popcorn action flicks and general hollywood blockbusters should be nowadays. It's part of #KeepingUpWithTheTimes #ForgetThePast.

Modern Warfare is intense and jammed packed with fast shooting, intense gameplay, brutal combat, concise gameplay and story, well rendered battle enviroments, and the multiplayer mode types that tend to, since this one, to be repeated in use in almost every Call of Duty following this one which was why I was so sick and fed up with this Modern COD stuff everyone was going for everywhere online. Now 10 years later, Call of Duty WWII has/is come out and we are back to the era that made Call of Duty famous since 2003 and when it put my former favorite FPS war franchise (Medal of Honor) to death.",The Game That Started a trend for new FPS's then and now........,1509667200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: Extremely difficult at times, weapons and enemies not well balanced, weak multiplayer, confusing controls

I finally got around to playing this game and I'm a bit disappointed mainly because of the game's extreme difficulty. While you can blow through most Ratchet games this one is just absurd! Bosses take WAY to long to kill and weapon, and armor upgrades are completely useless since you die in one hit anyways! Most of the weapons all do about the same damage and they cost WAY to many bolts to buy ammo for.

With this aside this is a solid platformer. The story starts out after the third game where R&C are taking a vacation and mayhem strikes again. While the game is very short it's pleasing with it's many mini-games and various game play twists like Lock Grinding. the weapons are pretty neat such as Bee Hive bombs, and the Water Sprout but they all feel the same and aren't very powerful even in their strongest form.

The graphics and audio are top notch and you shouldn't expect anything less than the PS2 games.

At first, I felt the game play is a bit slow--due to not so good equipment/gears, the player skill levels, player's partner's levels, etc. Once you can improve some of these aspects, it becomes better to play.

In the singel mod game, you can play 19 tournaments in 20 locations, with 179 field layouts. The game claims having 145 pieces of licensed gear, 39 real life players with 14 Pro players. In Multiplayer mode it supports 14-player head-to-head.

It's VERY easy to learn. I've been playing plenty of FPS games (currently, Ghost Recon 2 and Halo 2) and controller setting is no different from the usual FPS setups. Aiming is a little different because the quality of your gun and equipment changes the accuracy, velocity and distance of shooting. No worries, it's still easy to hit targets. Targets (your opponents) wear nice, bright outfit. It's super easy to spot enemies unlike Ghost Recon2.

The tutorial takes you through the basics of getting started-moving, shooting, jump-diving, switching the gun from left hand to right hand, and refilling paint. In fact, you can skip the tutorial, b/c the first game itself is the tutorial. Once done with tutorial, you begin the tournaments. It's been pretty tough for me to get used to the game play. Part of it is that in the beginning, you have very little skills and amateur partners. With this combination, it's tough to beat good opponents. Once you win some tournaments, it gets more interesting. With the prize money, you can upgrade your gears and eventually get better partners. To improve and to gain better gun/gear is an incentive to play a lot of single player mode. I've played the multiplayer mode on Xbox live only once. The game that I was playing online teams up with other online player (as your partner) agaist your opponents. Perhaps because all of us online were strangers, communication was poor. No strategic decisions were made. We went around shooting. I could see that it'd be more fun to play with friends as your teammates. I wish more of my friends would get this game. It's a nice change of pace from playing recent FPS games (GR2 and Halo2).

I can understand not rating the game as perfect- for it isn't- but coming here and whining about the game after you've played hundreds of hours is disingenuous at best.  I mean, look at a lot of these ""1-star"" reviews.  Many are extremely long.  Not ""Wow, I didn't enjoy playing this game at all!"" but rather ""Here's what Blizz is doing wrong in great and excruciating detail, a list which I have put together over the last five weeks of intensive gameplay.""

Blizzard, I suppose, is somewhat to blame.  People are reviewing this like it is a MMO that requires a subscription cost.  And if it were, I'd have a lot more sympathy to those 1-star reviewers.  But it's not.  There may be some games out there that cost $60 or less which you got more play time out of than Diablo 3, but in terms of hours of gameplay vs cost, Diablo 3 certainly ranks up towards the top for the games I've played over the last 20 years.  Also, regarding the RMAH- if you don't like it, don't use it.  I didn't.  I still beat the game on Inferno, too. It wasn't easy, but then, having to earn it makes it that much sweeter in the end.  Yes, I had to use the gold AH, but if you're not economically challenged it's really not difficult to sell the good gear which drops that you don't need and buy the good gear you DO need in order to beat Inferno.

Anyway, I'm not going to spend time on any more specifics, there are plenty of reviews that do that already.  I just can't help be amused by the 1-star reviews for a product that is -clearly- not a 1-star game.  Anybody who says otherwise is either a REALLY bad judge of video games, is reviewing this game as if it were a subscription MMO, or is trashing the game here in hopes that Blizz will make Inferno easier so everybody and their idiot brother will be able to beat it.  My only bit of advice to Amazon is simple: for people rating games like this, make them include in their review just how many hours they've played.  I know that's not realistic, but I think it might help bring some perspective to things, no?  Oh, and for the record: total play time for me = just over 200 hours.",What?

Only complaint about this game is the forced 2d platforming they make you do.  Yeah, it changes up the pace of the game so it isn't the same ole, same ole all the way through, but why the hell not when the game is so much fun to play.  Bad move by the designers but it doesn't ruin the game for me.

Story:  Girl gets kidnapped by the king of demons Flemming, who happens to be the girlfriend of the famous demon hunter Garcia Hotspur.  Flemming then tells the Garcia, that he is pretty much going to have his way with his girlfriend and theres nothing he can do about it.  As Flemming escapes into hell with Garcia's girlfriend garcia follows him into hell to get his girlfriend back.  Not so much an original story but was an entertaining one.  9/10

Gameplay:  If you have ever played Resident Evil 4 then you will be right at home with the movements and aiming mechanics involved in this game.  Thankfully you do not get stuck to the ground when you aim, like in RE4.  You have many ways of dispatching enemies in this game i forget to use em all.

Few things to know about hell.  Dead babies are gate keepers, you have to feed them: brains, eyeballs or strawberries.  Yup apparently strawberries are demon fruit and hells joke to the real world.  The darkness in hell is dangerous to anyone that is not dead so you must find light wherever you can.  Sometimes you have to make light on your own, either lighting up a lamp on the wall or shooting a goat in the face.  The light shot is a move you use to light up lamps/goats in hell as well as freeze enemies in place so you can either finish them off with a melee finisher, just aim for the head or switch to another gun and blast em to peices.  9/10

Weapons:

First weapon is your torch which is actually your shape-shifting brittish demon friend Johnson (the first of many penis jokes).  The torch pretty much helps you to keep demons back if they get too close but if you charge it up you can actually do some damage to em with it, killing em if you time it right.

Second is your gun the Boner(yup another penis joke)that shoots demon bones, which can get upgraded into the Hot boner, and lastly the Big boner.  Its the most reliable gun in the game basically for accuracy seeing how the enemies move around alot it is hard to aim for their vitals without freezing them with your light shot.

Third is the shotgun that shoots demon skulls and lastly the sub machine gun that shoots demon teeth.  The game lets you upgrade every weapon up to 3 times giving you cool alternate fires and ways to kill endless demons.

Nothing beats freezing an enemy with the light shot then blasting them with the shotgun.  10/10

Length.  Not too long but the humor involved in the story is funny enough to make you want to play the game again.  8/10

Content.  There is alot of cursing, penis jokes, dirty fairy tales, sexual innuendo, and of course a giant women in the background with their boobs hanging out which with whom you can use as a human bridge and walk through her cleavage to get to the next area.  I think if any game would match the humor, foul language and possible gore it would have to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splatterhouse/dp/B001E7MMNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splatterhouse</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dante-s-Inferno-Divine-Edition/dp/B001NX6GBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dante's Inferno Divine Edition</a>&nbsp;would be on the raunchier side mostly for the pure nakedness.  9/10

The things i disliked about this game.  As i said before the forced platforming levels.  I wish games like these would be the same game i bought all the way through instead of changing things around mid-game or near the end once i already got used to the controls.  Like i said its not a deal breaker its just a bit of an annoyance that hurts replay value seeing how it slows the game up and takes you away from the best part of the game, the demon hunting/slaying.  The penis jokes got old after awhile but the rest of the humor did make me laugh. Having to re-watch every cut-scene in the game when you died with no option to skip them and the inability to go back and pick up things you missed kind of annoyed the completion-ist in me, even if it helps the replay value somewhat.

The game combines several different styles of play - real time strategy, hack and slash action, open world exploration, and there's even a bit of racing thrown in.  In my opinion, this is a good thing.  It keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Progressing through the main story allows you to upgrade your weapons and car along the way, and there are several secondary missions to complete that will also help you upgrade.  The main quest is fairly short (roughly 10 hours) but completing all of the side quests and finding all the hidden objects will take nearly as long.  As a whole, the game is a lot of fun.  The story and voice acting are good (you'll recognize a lot of voices besides Jack Black), the characters are likeable and the soundtrack features some great heavy metal tunes.

The only thing you need to know is not to try to sync them when you first turn the system on or you will lose the sync as soon as you start a game. Instead, wait until have actually gone into the game and are on the opening screen or menu screen. If you sync at that time, you will have no issues. We did have to resync when we switched from MP8 to WSR, but did the same thing, resynced when we got to the menu screen and again had no issues. And in case you were wondering, as I did, when the controllers time out due to lack of use (ours did while we were eating dinner) they did NOT need to be synced again.

You do need to own one of the previous campaigns, so I recommend picking up Prophecies (Vanilla) since it's tied into this story. For the price tag of 20 dollars, you do get to do a ton of stuff and have fun doing them as well.

Story:

This expansion pack takes place in multiple locations as revolves around the Destroyers coming to life and having to gather forces together to strike back at them. While gathering a bunch of forces together has been done before, the back story we get on the Ebon/Norn/Asura is pretty awesome and it blends seamlessly into the world.

Gameplay:

This expansion adds something really cool to the game, and its titles that give you bonuses in the locations you are in and increase the more rep you get. For example in Norn area you gain more health, while the Ebon vanguard gives you bonuses to attacking Charr anywhere. This provides more incentive on farming the reputation that gives you straight up bonuses to the work you put in.

Just like the other expansions you get a bunch of skills that you can unlock for all classes and some of them are really powerful (Like the Ebon Battle Stand of Honor that increases all your allies' power by a set amount and a bonus against the Char). Some of them you unlock through quests while others you can just buy.

The location of this expansion is in Tyria and it feels like these locations were always here, like it was planned from the start. While you do start out in the mountains, you jump all over tyria, from the dinosaur infected jungles to the underground Dwarven encampments.

The monsters in these areas are higher leveled, but you get a buff that if you're not level 20 yet, it increases your abilities, health and energy to what they would be at level 20. You do stay your current level and gain a bunch of experience, so depending on your heroes you can power level through this area while you clear the story.
The main reason you should pick up this expansion if you own the other ones, is the Hall of Monuments. This allows you to add a bunch of stuff you have completed/collected in Guild Wars to unlock a bunch of equipment and titles in Guild Wars 2. A lot of them are hard to get, but if you manage to get 30/50 you get everything, besides some titles post 30 points.

Soundtrack:

The soundtrack is really good for this expansion and I think it's the best soundtrack out of all the expansions/vanilla content. It has an orchestration sound to the Norn theme, which is the first theme I really got into, so it's like the theme of Guild Wars for me. The other locations aren't bad, but the best has to be the northern shiverpeaks.

The voice acting is pretty good, but I think the character you play has a different voice actor this time around, but it's still good. Some of the audio seems to be a bit odd with the recording, mainly Jora. It seems like there is some static or something that makes her voice seem off.

Graphics:

It still looks the same as vanilla so I am just going to talk about the locations you can visit in this expansion. The first location you arrive in is the Northern Shiverpeaks, which looks really awesome with mountains everywhere and frozen lakes that slow you down if you stop moving. The towns reflect that Norn theme quiet well and it's nice to have a new look over the main games towns.

The Asuran homelands are a bunch of jungles, filled with Dinosaurs. Killing those is also a nice change of pace from killing the undead/infected. Just like the Norn villages, the Asuran ones are really different than the rest of the game and you can get a sense of their culture. The Charr locations have a look of war to them and you can see the devastation the Charr is bringing the land.

Verdict:

I quite enjoyed playing through this expansion. It was quite challenging at times, but once you beat it, it's a great sense of accomplishment. Also getting a bunch of rewards for just playing it doesn't hurt as well. The story is pretty cool, and leads into Guild Wars Beyond/Guild Wars 2, so I recommend checking it out if you're planning on playing Guild Wars 2.

This means that you are in effect paying for the development of an unfinished game. That being said, it gives you the chance to play the game during development, and ARK is very playable and the developers are exceptionally communicative and responsive to bug reports and deliver new content constantly.

ARK is a survival/crafting game with large worlds populated by many other players and by dinosaurs you can tame or fight. You can (must) farm, hunt, build, and provide security for yourself and any tamed creatures you might have. The real frustration with this game is that in PVP servers, anything you've built, tamed, or gathered can be destroyed while you're logged out. Most ""PVP"" is other people effectively murdering you in your sleep. If you find a large group (over 20) you can have a tribe that might be able to help you hold onto your things while you're not playing.

Beyond other people, the only real problems are that the game is pretty resource intensive.

The action varries from an urban landscape to a wasteland, and the weapons from familiar rifles, pistols, and grenades to nanotechnology that allows you to become nearly invulnerable, invisible, and able to see in the dark.  This is a first-person shooter with a credible storyline and some decent characterization and plotting.  I got just as involved in the story as I did the action.

PROJECT SNOWBLIND was developed by Crystal Dynamics and released by Eidos.  Crystal Dynamics has also developed the Legend of Kain series, the Gex series, and recently released TOMB RAIDER LEGENDS, the latest in the long-lived Lara Croft adventure series.

I really got into the game immediately.  There was enough storytelling and world development to get me into the mood, and then I got plopped down into a battlefield and had to fight for my life.  One of the things I quickly learned was to not try to Rambo it and do it all myself.  I was leading a team, so I backed off, kept myself alive and picking off enemy soldiers, and started taking the levels pretty easily without constantly dying as I first was.  Of course, then I was promptly blown up in a cut-scene I had no control over.

Thankfully, the military rebuilt me, made me better than I was, and sent me back to the war with nano-enhancements that made me a super-soldier.  But the game stress upgraded too.  Even with careful play, if I made a mistake or played too arrogantly, I paid for it.

The graphics in the game are good.  The controls are fluid, and after a little while of working out how to bring everything into play, I was a super-soldier on the battlefield.  The action swept through an urban arena that featured shootouts in the streets and in blown-up buildings.  The superpowers that came along with the nano upgrade were a blast and easy to operate.  But you have to keep your eyes open not only for the enemy, but for the upgrades, medkits, ammo, and energy packs.  Not only do you get you use personal weaponry, but you also get to hook up behind some heavy artillery and drive vehicles.

When you play the game online, up to 16 players can join in, working as two-man teams.

I had a great time with PROJECT SNOWBLIND.  I remember when it came out, but didn't pick it up because I hadn't heard that much about it.  Evidently there wasn't much media push at the time, which is a shame because this is a game well worth playing if you like shooters or co-ops.

- Graphics were my biggest complaint with the original Rainbow 6 Vegas. It looked like a PS2.5 game. Well, rest assured Vegas 2 corrects this glaring problem with significantly better graphics. From textures to lighting, scenery to players, graphics have been improved across the board. It's still not up to COD4 standards, but pretty damn close.

- Gameplay is top notch, as expected from the original. Cover is easy to use and a key aspect of this game. Unlike COD4, Rainbow forces the player to use strategy to succeed.

- Character customization is excellent. You can select every detail - clothes, armor, guns, even camo patterns. As you progress through the game, and move up in rank, more items are unlocked. What's nice is you earn XP regardless of what game mode you play - single player, online or split screen. That's a nice touch.

- Location design is fresh, highlighting the darker side of Vegas this time around. You'll still get to tear up some casinos, but you'll also play in junk yards, train stations and refineries. Online mode level design is also well done, covering a wide range of locations.

- Speaking of online mode, this aspect of the game has been enhanced. There are more modes to choose from, a more robust XP/rank system. I also found it easy to join games, better than COD4. My favorite mode is terrorist hunt.

- Sound - good use of surround with excellent explosion and gun fire sounds.

The Bad:
- Sound glitches - I found a few instances were the rear surround speakers crackle or pop. Also, sometimes after killing an enemy their gun fire continues to sound off. I'm surprised these obvious bugs were overlooked.

- Story modes lacks a good story... but it's not a big deal.

- As mentioned above graphics could still use some improvement.

The Verdict:
Overall, this is an excellent sequel. It fixes the problems of the original and builds on all the things that were great.

I have not played the multiplayer section of the game, so I can't comment on that. I usually play these types of games for the campaign.

The graphics are really good & polished, but it does look like a PS3 game as others have stated in their reviews. When it comes to frame rate issues, the only one I have experienced was a quick jitter during the loading screen between levels. Other than that the game runs really smooth during play.

4.0,True,"12 4, 2011",ADQFN4681WQL,B000FQBPCQ,CP,"This Zelda game started off real slow.  The first half of the game, I was extremely disappointed.  It felt very linear- everything was cut off until you completed some task to open up another small area, rinse and repeat.  There was no connection with the characters.  Everything felt forced.  And everything felt handed to you.  Epona... here you go.  In Ocarina, you actually had to work to get her, and when you did it was awesome.  Here, everything is obtained so easily, including the Master Sword.  There's no buildup.  In A Link to the Past, you see the Master Sword all shining in the grove and you're like, man I've gots to get me that.  But you had to work for it.  In this game, it's like Master Sword? What's that?  Oh this thing that I just happened to get as I was following this extemely linear storyline?  Let me just put it this way.  In previous games, you would see a locked door.  So guess what?  You have to go find the key.  In this game, 95% of the time, you'll have managed to obtain the key before you even know there's a locked door.  Why even make the door locked in the first place?  And don't get me started on the boring fetch quest of finding the Twilight Tear bugs.  Jeebus.
The first half of the game also felt too easy.  I never really felt any threat of dying.  Well, I didn't do so good on the bridge joust at first (cough cough)fell off a few times, but aside from that, enemies were handled too easily by a simple wagging of the wii controller.  Bosses looked epic and amazing, but when it takes them a million hits to knock you down 3 hearts, well, there's no impending threat and you can calmly figure out how to beat them.  Not that it was hard to figure out.
Well, ok... that being said, the second half of the game got much better.  You can finally explore a bit.  Castle town opens up where you can finally mingle with the townsfolk.  You can play some sidegames, go on some side quests.  Now this is Zelda as I know it.  Freedom to explore.
The game difficulty got better as well.  Some enemies actually required some attack timing and finesse.  And thank you for the Cave of Ordeals- a combat challenge at last- something I felt was sorely lacking in Ocarina and Majora's Mask (haven't played Wind Waker yet).  But I still wished that enemy attacks took off more of your health.  It just doesn't feel threatening when some badazz looking enemy smacks you, and you lose only 1/2 a heart.  I remember the good ol days of the original Zelda when some baddies took off like 4 hearts.  Now that's what'll make you sweat.  In a good way.  Cause that's what really motivates you to find heart containers, find bottles, and buy potions.  I rarely bought any potions in this game.  My bottles usually carried lantern oil.  Now that's a travesty.
I did however really enjoy the 2nd half of this game.  I actually quit playing during the first half- put it away for months- but then decided I had to force myself to finish it.  But thankfully, I found myself liking it more and more.
I would have initially given this 2-3 stars, but it redeemed itself in the end to get 4.
Graphics were awesome.  Doesn't feel outdated at all, even playing it in 2011.  In my opinion, grpahics don't need to get any better than this.  It's all about the gameplay from here.
Controls were ok.  I hated the fact that when Link has his sword sheathed, you have to waggle to get the sword out, and then waggle again to swing.  So if you switch to using your secondary item, like a bow or hookshot, Link automatically sheathes his sword.  I don't know how many times I rolled when I meant to do a jump strike.  And the nunchuck analog felt a bit wanky.  Sometimes I had a hard time positioning Link right to just open a treasure chest or grab that fallen rupy instead of circling around it.
The item menu sucked.  Why have everything in a big circle with things moving around all the time once you get a new item.  I like knowing where my stuff is in a visually friendly format that's easy to navigate.
Ok, I feel like I just keep going back to the negative stuff so I'm going to end my review here.  Good thing, too, because I have alot more complaints believe me.

The game is heavy on the simulation.  Everything is very realistic--down to players arguing calls and mound visits to the low run scoring games.  Pither vs batter is done well where tough pitchers are tough to hit and not-so great pitchers will be somewhat easier to go up against.
While this game is one of the best baseball titles out in the market, it does have its bad side.  First, being on the Psx2, you'd figure awesome graphics, animation, and sound--not here.  The graphics are Psx1 quality, the sound is so-so (with poor play-by-play and sound effects) and the animation is far from being great.  Stat tracking is not that great either.  The main thing I found missing in this game is a batting practice or homerun derby to work on your hitting.  Hitting in this game is not easy and there is no option or feature to practice your swings.

4.0,False,"06 16, 2008",A10OOQ653VNEQH,B00144151O,D. Crawford,"First of all this review is written by a newer fan of NASCAR games. I've played a little in the past but nothing seriously due to not really liking the title. I thought the past games were boring, however this game seems a little different and more fun. With that said, my attitude may have changed not because of the game but because of my recent attitude towards NASCAR. I have a favorite driver now so it makes following the sport a lot more fun. As for the game, overall the game is fun and there are some neat features to it such as the things you can do in the garage to customize your car for race day, the graphics during gameplay are amazing and the different options such as career mode and season mode are great!

As for things I don't like about the game, I wish EA could be a little more creative when it came to coming up with the generic sponsors. There were a couple featured sponsors such as COKE that are cool however the no-name sponsors that EA Sports made up were mostly dorky and it was hard to pick out sponsors to put on my car and make it look good. I'm sorry I don't want sponsors such as ""Pat and Son's lumber"" on my car. I understand the game needed to put some of the lowerlevel dorky sponsors on there to make it realistic however there were too many of them which makes it hard to make a customized car look good on the track. Basically EA needs to improve on the sponsor graphics and take more into account how the overall sponsors' pictures look - they look too cartoonish and unsporty to me.

Another thing about the game I didn't care to much for is that the handling of the car while racing is hard especially when rounding a corner of a track. I'm banging into everyone and I'm not even trying to. I had to turn off black flag options (being disqualified for reckless driving) to even finish a race. This was frustrating. It was hard to pass other cars with out at least tapping them a little. To be all honest this may be due to me being a new fan of NASCAR games and I'm not use to this style of racing in which braking and patience is a must. Also I know nothing about adjustments to a car to make it handle better so all of those features to tweek a car are worthless to me. I wish there could be an option in which the comupter could take care of that based on my driving style... that would be neat.

I enjoyed the storyline, I enjoyed the little side tasks, the bounty hunting. If one task felt repetative or boring, i went to something else. great story, surprisingly good voice acting. I like the open world setup -- in fact, it reminded me of World of Warcraft in that there was so much to do it was hard to stop playing most nights.

The only downside is that the MP in Red Dead Redemption really tested my patience. I guess I'm just not a fan of the fact that in the Free Roam other players will just randomly shoot me if I'm just on my horse minding my own business or trying to do a gang hideout. I kind of liked the deathmatch-flavored games, but i didn't spend much time on the other game types.

4.0,True,"01 14, 2008",A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B000TTZMCS,Michael Kerner,"When it comes to games about memory, none of them have shined brighter on any other system than the Nintendo DS. After the mammoth success of puzzle and mind games like Big Brain Academy, and Brain Age and its sequel, there have been many games that have been knockoffs that just haven't shined as vividly. Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped the people who've developed Brain Age, Touch Generations, from expanding the gameplay that Brain Age that appears to be strong to the eyes. Well, they've done it again, and it shows how fast can your sight be in your mind to catch it.

Flash Focus: Vision Training In Minutes A Day, brings the success of Brain Age, in a more visual sense. The game includes many training exercises that focus in on accuracy and timing, rather than how much your brain weighs and age. There are many mini-game exercises here that work to the test, including sports games like table tennis, soccer, baseball and football. But, it isn't just about sports at all alone here, the game also shows how fast you can memorize patterns, and sight. The graphics look good but the gameplay is just as addictive as we've seen before. Sadly, the game doesn't do enough to seperate itself from others, with a lack of multiplayer gameplay, but the game does test your sight well.

All in all, Flash Focus: Vision Training In Minutes A Day isn't a bad purchase for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay is a test of how well wew see things and observe more than meets the eye. If you've played Brain Age, you'll definitely want to add Flash Focus in as a part of your video game library.

4.0,False,"10 12, 2012",AEOZ4EQQG10I3,B0050SXLQC,C. H. Mauricio,"Resident Evil 4 united the fans with its bold new direction. Resident Evil 5 drew the division among the fans. Now, with Resident Evil 6, a declaration of war has been announced and both sides are now much like Northern Ireland. Many franchises this generation have gone through so many changes. Changes that defy what the previous generation(s) has set in order to stay relevant. Whether it be Grand Theft Auto, Final Fantasy, and the poster child of them all, Resident Evil, the changes set forth with these brand new iterations test the dedication of older fans while embracing a new crowd. A crowd who's into games such as multiplayer online shooters. A crowd with less tolerance to obscure old games. And a crowd that has the buying power that companies such as CAPCOM see as a much needed resource to keep afloat.

At the expense of all these are of course, a certain group of old fans. Veterans who grew up with the classic Resident Evil games. Veterans who knew this series as a franchise that is more about putting in quick frights, some tension, and running away from becoming zombie food. It is this same fan base that unfortunately, are stuck in the past. Their nostalgia is clouding the truth. What do you mean? Well, allow me to explain. A common complaint about the status of the Resident Evil franchise among this now minor, yet loud vocal group, is that the games have lost their survival horror roots. While in reality, they are supporting a form of gameplay that is no longer relevant in today's video games. You can't make a survival horror game anymore with strange controls played through static pre-rendered (or polygonal as in Code Veronica's case) backgrounds. Room by room puzzles which make little sense and constant backtracking through load screen after load screen of watching doors open is old, dated, un viable game design nowadays. Throw in a game like that in this modern era, watch your sales tank.

Along with the complaints about Resident Evil games no longer are about survival horror and has turned into an action game. Again, their nostalgia has clouded the truth. Resident Evil, has always been an action-centric game of survival horror. Even back in 1999, when a little game called Silent Hill came out, contrasting views about the first three Resident Evil games versus the original Silent Hill came to the conclusion that Resident Evil was far more action oriented than Akira Yamaoka's psychological thriller. Also, ticked off fans, may I remind of phrases such as Battle Mode, Extreme Battle, The Mercenaries, these are bonus modes that you unlocked in various Resident Evil games and they are all focused on combat action. What were the most coveted secrets that you unlocked in Resident Evil? Why infinite ammo of course! Infinite Rocket Launchers, infinite Gatling guns, infinite Magnum bullets. So you can blast your way through the campaign and kill all zombie and monster that gets in your way.

Finally, I would like to point out that in Japan, the Resident Evil games are known as BIOHAZARD over there. Think about this. The first Resident Evil game had an isolated viral outbreak on a mansion complex in the middle of nowhere. Evil pharmecutical corporation creates a virus that turns bio organic beings such as humans and animals into bio organic weapons or in short B.O.W.s. The sequel and its follow up has this virus spread on to a city. Evil company is eventually dissolved but the threat from bio organic weaponry has continued thanks to terrorist organizations going underground and releasing more terror into the world. Resident Evil, or BIOHAZARD as it is known in Japan has always been a series about bio organic weapons and the group of people who are willing to stop them from eliminating mankind. It started in isolation, and has since become a global threat, a natural progression.

Thus where Resident Evil 6 or as it is known in Japan, BIOHAZARD 6 continues the struggle against the threat of bio terrorism continues. A brand new strain of virus has been released under the name C-Virus and it is up to series veterans Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy, along with new faces Jake Mueller, Helena Harper, Piers Nivans, and a returning character Sherry Birkin (the youngest survivor of the 1998 Raccoon City outbreak) to stop and uncover the malicious plans of the re-organized Neo-Umbrella from wiping out humanity. It is the largest cast ever ensembled in franchise history and they are all playable from the start. The game is the most ambitious Resident Evil game by featuring well over 20 hours of story campaign content that is divided on to four separate and distinct but intertwining storylines. Each of the four campaigns are divided into 5 chapters with each lasting from an 1 hour to 1 and a half hours to complete. To put this in perspective, one campaign in Resident Evil 6 is roughly 70% of the entirety of Resident Evil 5. This is completely unprecedented considering the length of most action games nowadays that last a good 6-8 hours to complete and rely upon multiplayer modes to extend the replay value. ON top of these campaigns, you have a multitude of multiplayer options that range from co-op split screen or online for three of the four main campaigns, Agent Hunt which enables players to take the role of the enemy and try to disrupt one's story mode experience, and the ever so popular The Mercenaries return once more which has you killing zombies and racking up as much points as possible with a minimal time limit. Resident Evil 6 is a complete experience in its current state but Capcom plans to add even more extras. For a game priced at 60 bucks, this one is full of content pound for pound. A rarity in this day and age.

With the amount of content RE 6 offers, is any of it actually good? There are a few quirks that get in the way of the fun and feel cheap but I'll get to them later. The gameplay in RE 6 has taken the principles set by RE 4 and modernizing them while still retaining trademarks of the series. Some of the trademarks are as mentioned, the story and the whole lore of the series such as mutations which no other games can pull off as good as this franchise. Other RE related materials still present are the usage of herbs to heal yourself. Leon's campaign in particular feels like Resident Evil 2 in the beginning where he witnesses the destruction of yet another small American town.

Gameplay in particular spruced up some of the quirks from RE 5. For instance you can walk while aiming and shooting at the same time (which admittedly have been used since The Mercs 3D on the 3DS), but now appearing for the first time on a properly numbered sequel. Movement in general has seen some improvement this time where you no longer feel like you are controlling a tank. The range of motion that the characters display are far more convincing now. Melee has been tweaked up to be more useful (just like in RE 4). In RE's 4 & 5, you would first shoot an enemy on a certain limb which will have them react in a certain way. During this reaction, you get close to the enemy then initiate a melee attack. Now, pressing the R1 button while not aiming will initiate a melee attack which you can use to take an enemy down. Another way of taking out foes is using the brand new quick shot maneuver which is a critical shot more powerful than the standard shot. It can be used for almost all weapons in the game and is a great technique against mutated foes. Initiating a quick shot will put an enemy on a daze which you can in turn use a melee attack to finish them off. Now all of this melee and quick shot business may sound like overpowering yourself but all of this is governed by a stamina gauge to ensure that you have to take breaks from using them. It's a nuanced system and in order to use it effectively, you should mix up your battle styles especially during heated moments of battle. Skill buffs return here however you can't upgrade individual weapons. Instead you are assigned skill slots that can be changed to suit certain situations. You'll be grinding for skill points so you can increase traits such as firearm power, defense, and etc. Ideally, you'll want to create two or three preset skills that you interchange in between to fit situations. For example, during standard runs, you'll want to focus on a skill set with firearm, item drop increase, and melee attacks. However, when you reach the next room with a boss encounter, you may want to switch to a preset that has increased defense, improved medic recovery, and increased firearm (skills can be repeated in between presets which is nice) to deal with a boss. It's a flexible system that caters to any player's style of play.

The overall nature of the gameplay is that it is very linear and not much in terms of exploration and deviation from the proper path. Considering the game's total length it's not such a bad thing. The game has a reliance on moving you from one set-piece stage to another. Resident Evil 4 introduced this and they took it to the next level with RE 6. The game feels like a blockbuster movie in this aspect which can be a complete turn off for some. But because of the game's intertwining stories, some events are admittedly identical between the campaigns. It isn't a game killer at all. However, some moments of this game will frustrate you in the name of cheap deaths and to artificially create unnecessary difficulty. One particular event deals with Jake's campaign on the second chapter. The stage is set on a mountain and will have you looking for three USB-like devices that needs to be recovered. Blinding snowstorms will limit your visibility and enemies with snipers have god-like accuracy only serve to irritate the player not cause a terrifying sense of urgency. The snipers in general can be cheap little bastards and they will test your nerves. A certain time sensitive chase sequence during the final stage for the Chris campaign can also be frustrating in the name of cheap deaths. Quick time events, or QTEs are over used in this game and will test your patience with their ridiculousness. Some of the event scenes will require you to kick start an engine or use C4 explosives require you to press a certain button at a certain time. These are strange and ridiculous game design and can bring your enjoyment down a bit for as long as they last.

Resident Evil 6 runs on the now old Resident Evil 5 engine. Because the game is so huge, separate teams at Capcom were employed to create the look of the game. The result overall looks quite nice and with high production values were used for the cinematics. However, chapter 3 for Chris' campaign looks absolutely horrid and must have been rushed to finish the game this early. But in the end, Resident Evil 6 is a nice looking game overall. The voice acting is superb and deliver their lines well.

Resident Evil 6 is a larger than life installment for this beloved franchise. It does stumble in a few aspects because of its ambitious nature with questionable game designs here and there. But that alone does not hurt this game to low scores unlike the way some ""professional"" critics have reviewed it. It's by default my favorite game in the franchise now because it offers so much in terms of replayability and content. I've been with this franchise since the very beginning and have supported its multiple changes throughout the years. With four distinct campaigns, a plethora of post-game replay value, and long length, Resident Evil 6 gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.","The best ""4.5 out of 10"" game you'll ever play.",1350000000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have been saying since season 1 to PLEASE make a video game version of the show.  If you watch the show, even if you are not an avid fan, you can see why a game version would be amazing.  Though I feel like the makers of this game cut corners, and it is not as breathtaking as it could have been if a real studio had its hand in making it, it is still never-the-less a very interesting game.  In a world ravaged by first person shooters and open world games, this game takes a different turn - a turn based style of gaming.  You are in control of a squad- anywhere from 1-6 units, and you embark on missions, completing objectives, and spend each mission in a turn based style of gameplay.  You begin each mission by moving your squad a few spaces, and then it is the enemy's turn.  Enemies are not randomly appearing, but more like you need to ""see"" them.  If you have moved all of your squad members up and have not encountered any aliens, then it is your turn.  However, if you are in a combat situation, then you have a turn to move, attack,reload, take cover, etc.  and then your enemies have their turn and so on.  This is how the game progresses.  It is not a open world game, but turn based.  I will admit, the first mission or two I found quite boring and dull.  But being such a huge fan of the show, I couldn't turn off the game and wanted to play it through.  While I was somewhat bored and found this gameplay style somewhat tedious, within a few missions, I was quite engaged in the game and really enjoyed it.  It is just that is is such a different type of gameplay than I was used to.

Something I found very interesting and enjoyable which adds a layer of immersion and customization in the game is that it follows the idea of the TV show.  Between mission, you are at Base Camp, where you can do a variety of things.  By completing missions, you can gain 3 resources (food, metal, and medical supplies).  You can then use these supplies at Base Camp in the Infirmary, Workshop, and/or Armory to upgrade and research your squad.  Armory allows you to train new recruits, manage their equipment, and research new things such as increasing your squad size.  The workshop allows you to research and upgrade weapons, ammunition, grenades, armor, and the like.  Infirmary allows you to upgrade and research medical things, like first aid kits, defibrillators, gauze, etc.  Everything you can research offers increased bonuses or upgrades and can be used in the armory and equipped.  I enjoyed this aspect of the game, and found it tied in well with the show.

Some important things to note about this game is that they provide you with a few classes of units; berserkers (LMG and rocket launcher), fighters (assault rifle), spiked kids which are basically the people who the Espheni captured and had their harnesses removed (machine gun), sniper (sniper rifle), and field medic which offer unlimited use of medical equipment.  Each class has its uses, and weaknesses, for example berserkers pack a lot of firepower but are more effective at closer range.  Snipers are extremely powerful, but very weak to enemy attacks, etc.  I find this game to be better for older individuals, as since it is turn based, younger players will get bored easily, and may not comprehend the strategy aspect as well as they should.  There also is a campaign but it did not follow the TV show's plot at all.  Another thing to note is that there is not multiplayer or even any online option.  It is a strictly single player game.  If you are interested in getting achievements, the achievements for the game are almost impossible to miss and each one is worth 50 gamerscore, so it is also an easy way to boost your score.  The graphics however, are not that great, they feel more like N64 type graphics which was kind of depressing, as well as text in the game is cut off.  If you revive a fallen soldier, the text will say something like ""James will survive, but we should get them to...""  and then not end.  Not a big deal and doesn't really affect the game, but I mean... it's 2015.

If you like the tv show, you should definitely play this game just because.  It may be a bit slow in the beginning, but you will start to get into it within a few missions and especially if you find yourself researching new weapons or upgrading existing ones.  The turn based style of play may bore some, but I adjusted fairly quickly.  All in all, it was a decent game.  If you are expecting something on the level of the mega-hits like Call of Duty or Borderlands in terms of play or quality, you will be severely disappointment.  But it is a modest game for a modest TV show.  However, I do feel it could have been an epic game if done with a bigger budget or better quality studio.  For what it is though, it isn't bad and definitely worth your time.  It also does follow the TV show in small ways like scavenging for materials or ways to outsmart your enemy, but the main plot is not the same.  I also was upset that the game was picky with their main characters, you cannot control them, and sometimes they are a playable character for certain missions, but mostly it is random people you get to control.  The game only really mentions Tom, Pope, Maggie, Anthony, and Ben.  No Hal, Matt, Anne, Weaver... Again a bit of a disappointment.","For a fan of the show, a must play.

So it's pretty durable and I would say it was worth the $70 I paid for it. The force feedback is great and has always helped me get a feel for the track (it's particularly helpful in simulations like iRacing). Overall the wheel has a nice feel to it and it's adapted well to the multiple PC games I play.

The pedals are decent. Unfortunately after only about a year of use both pedals felt much looser, and the brake pedal would squeak so badly that I was afraid it would snap on me (which is what happened with my Logitech Wingman). The pedals leave a bit to be desired, but with that being said they've held their own over four years.

The biggest issue I had with the MOMO is the clamps for the wheel. When I got the wheel I had no idea that there were two clamps hidden under a plastic cover. So for the longest time I attempted to use the wheel with one clamp, and needless to say, I went through a lot of trouble getting the wheel to clamp to any surface. I guess not knowing those clamps were there is partially my fault, but I'm disappointed that Logitech didn't make those clamps more obvious. I didn't even have documentation that notified me of the two hidden clamps.

Overall I'd say the Logitech MOMO is worth purchasing. It has its issues, but the wheel up is the $300 G27, so if you're not willing to spend that much this is a good alternative. Based on its performance I'd say over $100 is a little pricey, but if you can find it for cheaper I'd recommend it!",Good wheel with a couple frustrating problems.,1310688000,3,,
4.0,True,"05 24, 2010",A20FK68BUB1IVA,B002N7GHNM,Happy Reader,"I want to start out with what I feel is a major mistake made by another reviewer of ""Clockwork Man"".  The reviewer talked about a glitch in the game - he had come up with the right solution to a puzzle but the game didn't show that solution so it was a glitch in the programming and he skipped the puzzle. This certainly doesn't encourage you to buy the game.  But I feel the reviewer was WRONG!  I know which puzzle he's talking about because I just finished Clockwork Man.  It's a fairly standard I.Q. type question. It shows you a picture of an object, and then it shows another picture of what that object turned into (by changing colors and/or by rotating the object). I'll call that the template before and after. You're shown a row of four different objects. Underneath each of the four objects is a set of pictures and you have to decide which of the pictures shows each of those four objects if they underwent the same changes that occured in the template before and after.

This was the hardest puzzle for me, and at one point I was just as sure as that other reviewer that there was a problem because the game wasn't showing me what I ""knew"" would be the correct ""after"" picture.  WRONG!  After puzzling over it again, I realized that on the template object, if it was rotated 90 degrees to the right, it looked exactly the same as if it was rotated 90 degrees to the left.  However, in two of the other four objects, rotating to the left came up with something different than rotating right. So if you were sure that rotating right was the correct procedure, you would come up with an ""after"" picture that the game didn't offer as an ""after"".  So, in my opinion, and I've finished the game, there is NO GLITCH in the game.

Now on to my regular review!
My favorite games are adventure and puzzle games, but I've enjoyed a lot of hidden object games too. I can't sit down and play a pure hidden object game for hours because I get bored, so I prefer to have the hidden object scenes mixed in with puzzles and adventure.  The Clockwork Man does just that.  I have positive things to say about this game, but I'll first mention the reasons I didn't give it five stars: 1) It's a little short, and 2) The storyline and dialogue are aimed more for the younger set, say the tweens and below. This doesn't make it bad in and of itself, it just makes it not the perfect fit for me (an adult who plays a lot of PC games).

Another thing that makes this game perfect for youngsters as well as casual gamers who aren't as competitive as me is that the game gives you a lot of help.  Puzzles, hidden object finding and adventure tasks are not timed, hints are ""free"" with just a short wait before you can ask for a second hint, puzzles can be skipped altogether if you wish, and in the hidden object scenes, there's no penalty for incorrect clicking.

Also, compared to regular adventure games, when you have an adventure task in The Clockwork Man, you also can get hints.  Let's say you have to get a machine started using your inventory items. In a regular adventure game, you have to just try this and that until something starts working. In Clockwork Man, a hint will say something like, ""I can't put the vinegar in until I open the top.""  So then you know your next step.

This hint system doesn't have any effect on someone determined to not use hints, because (obviously) you just don't use the hints. But it does open the game up to the younger player and casual gamer.  Besides, in regular adventure games, most players have to find a walkthrough on the internet for a hint at least once in a game, and having the hints closer to hand in Clockwork Man saves you trouble.

I have a like and dislike about the game's hidden object scenes. In strict hidden object games, such as the Amazing Adventures and Mystery Case Files series, items, on the whole, are really out in the open, they're just cleverly camoflauged.  Sometimes, in Clockwork Man, items are in a jumbled pile, that is, an object is literally hidden rather than camoflauged. Since there's no penalty for incorrect clicking, this isn't that big of a deal, but it still felt like the game was ""cheating""!!

However, I really REALLY liked one set-up of the hidden object scenes. Some were static (one view, standard), some had a zoom (where you zoomed in on just one part of the scene), but the very best, which I've never seen in any other game, were the scenes with scroll.

In these scenes, you use their arrow keys to scroll, shifting your view to the right or left, as if you were on a moving walkway taking you one way and back the other in front of a large panorama. What is totally cool about it is that as you shift your position, just like in real life, you will see something that was previously hidden behind something that was directly in front of you. So, as you shift to the right, you not only have to check out the new area of the scene you're seeing on the right, you have to check back on the left to see if anything has been revealed by your position change. This takes longer to describe than it does to do it. It was engaging, creative and a lot of fun.

This is a fun game, and I recommend it, especially for the price.

What I loved:
+The graphics are amazing
+Level Design is great (if linear, but I like that for games like this)
+Learning curve is great
+Multiplayer is awesome

Shortfalls
-Controls aren't perfect. More than once I've thought, ""I wouldn't have died here with a mouse and keyboard."" or even a second button instead of a universal, do all button.
-They steal the good bits from you. Why are all the cutscenes amazing? Why can't I play those parts instead of watching Dominic and the gang do them while I watch the screen? These parts REALLY made me miss Half-Life's storytelling style.
-Quibbly problems with autosave locations (really? I have to unblock that door up the stairs and down the long hallway AGAIN before running to the APC?)

Otherwise, great game that everyone should try. Borrow it from a friend and buy a copy if you like the first couple levels. The action is fast and intense and NOTHING beats that first chainsaw kill.

4.0,False,"04 17, 2012",A1W7JW829H45AE,B00420K18K,Charles M. Strnad,"I've reviewed MLB:The Show every year for the past few years, concentrating on Franchise Mode, for those who (like me) mostly just like to play through an entire season vs: the CPU, with your favorite team. This one will be the same, except not as lengthy, and mostly as a rebuttal to the continuing reviews posted to this site, that maintain that this game is too hard, and for that reason, therefore ""no fun.""

I use The Show for only one thing: to play a full Spring training and 162 game regular season (and hopefully, playoffs)with my hometown Chicago White Sox, playing against the CPU. I play on All Star hitting level, and Hall of Fame pitching level, with slider adjustments that help make gameplay results realistic, as far as individual player and final team stats go. One of the best aspects of The Show is exactly that: you can edit just about every aspect of this game, to find a level that plays out well for YOU. This review will not deal with any of the other gameplay modes (on-line, Road To The Show, etc), since I don't ever use those when I play.

The following are my observations about The Show 2012- it will be useful (I hope) mostly to those who have played this game series before.

1- The new ""pulse pitching"" I don't use at all. Analog pitching, IMO, is still the best, in that, besides generating realistic results, also most gives the human user the feel for real pitching. It recreates the actual sense of throwing a pitch very well, whereas aiming your marker at a pulsing circle obviously does not. It seems to me that any game control should be designed mainly to give the gamer reasonable results, and also at least somewhat recreate what it is like to actually be playing the game of baseball. For that reason, I also use zone control hitting, but more on that below. With analog pitching, moving the right stick back to wind up, then forward to release the ball (with aiming of the pitch done with the left analog stick)really gives me a sense that I am ""reaching back' to pitch. The variability in pitch results, which also depends in a big way on the particular skills of your pitcher, are sometimes frustrating, but also best recreates real baseball. Nobody hits their spot all the time, after all. But if you know what real MLB games are like, this won't bother you all THAT much.

2- I use zone control hitting, which means to swing, I aim the left analog stick at where the ball is coming in, and ""swing"" by pressing the x-button. I haven't found the full analog hitting (where you pull back and push forward to ""stride"") to give me any better sense for hitting a baseball than what I currently use. But again, you can set the hitting controls to any method you wish- dealer's choice. The CPU is tough, no doubt, in their pitch selection and location, and has been like that every year with this game. This year is no different: if you want a game where you can casually hit a button and get a lot of hits/score a lot of runs, this game will totally and repeatedly frustrate you. Hitting, just like the real thing, requires total user concentration on each pitch, and no small amount of baseball savvy, to know how to work the count, look for certain pitches and pitch locations, and then to swing ONLY when you get your pitch. With those simple baseball fundamentals, through 43 games in my first Franchise season with the White Sox (ie; not exactly the best hitting team in the game), I have a team batting average of .303, have hit 58 home runs, and scored just a little under 6 runs per game. I average 3 walks per game, but do still strike out too much (8.5 times per game currently- the real MLB average is 3 walks and 7 K's per game, for a team). But again, the vast majority of my K's are not because the game is ""too hard"", but because I swung at bad pitches, out of the zone. I'd only reply to those who maintain that ""hitting is impossible"", etc: these are my results, and on something more than the easiest difficulty levels, too.

3-The announcers, unfortunately, are still VERY repetitive, and after a few games, dreadfully boring. While there are a few new lines of dialogue this year, trying to create an ESPN-type dialogue, the game developers also chose to leave ALL of the same tired dialogue that plagued last year's game intact for this one. IMO, the announcing remains easily the biggest weak point of this year's game.

4-Graphics/game animations require no comment, as they remain the best you will ever see in any sports videogame, bar none. With one small exception: you will see a ton of foul balls hit off to the side of the plate, where the ball seems to be made more out of flubber than a real baseball....50 foot high bounces on these foul balls must have struck the game developers as interesting, but to me, it's pretty lame.

5- My short list of things that still make this less than a 5 star game for me are (and sadly, many are the same as last year):
  Still WAY too many wild pickoff throws by your pitcher, especially to first base.

  Still WAY to many random freezes by your baserunners, resulting in you getting picked off.

  Still WAY too many scoring errors: errors given when NO error occurred during the play, errors given
  to a fielder who couldn't get a glove on a bullet through the infield, etc, etc

  Still WAY too many bad ball/strike calls by the home plate umpire: it's nice to include the human
  variability factor in this, since that IS real baseball after all, but should it occur
  100 times a game, every game?????

  Still WAY too frequent outfield plays, where you want to get to the ball quickly and get it to the
  cut-off man, but the game simply won't let you: your fielder acts
  like he has better things to do, and strolls over to field the ball

  Still WAY too repetitive announcer lines, and WAY more commentary mistakes, than even last year.

That's all I want to say for this year's MLB The Show. In summary, it's hardly the impossibly difficult game some would have you believe, but it is still full of enough annoying little things to keep it from being a 5 star effort.

And fun?  I'd say that depends entirely on what you are looking for, in a baseball videogame.

If you are looking for easy results, and winning without much effort, this game is clearly not for you, and never has been for you.

But, if you enjoy the challenge of real baseball, this is the only baseball videogame worth playing.","Rebuttal/Review: Reality check for Show gamers, 2012 edition",1334620800,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"06 3, 2014",A3E610EXHOMIO6,B000ZJVDA2,twinklemenads,"I am pleasantly suprised by this game even though I am not very far into it.  It is very final fantasy-ish and has turn based combat, a rarity on the x360, where you actually have to use strategy as apposed to mashing on the buttons like a 4 year old.  The game is 4 discs.  Unnecessarily large yes.  Because of this I assumed it would be 80% videos and not really a game at all.  But I was mistaken.  It's not many fmv's all the time yet, at all.  I'm not sure why there is 4 discs maybe some type of copy protection scheme or they want to make it seem like it is an old playstation final fantasy.  Or... maybe the constant fmv's start later in the game, hope not...

So you are some dude who is immortal supposedly and can't recall his past.  Can't say I really care.  JRPGs in particular seem to forget that its a GAME not some kind of epic movie or novel designed to make your heart flutter.  I do not care about such nonsense from a video game.  However the characters in this game are pretty cool looking and lifelike looking.  Even though it appears they are all wearing too much eye shadow, especially the male characters....  Their weapons also look very cool.  It is well designed from an art standpoint.  Voice acting is pretty good, music, sound effects, a good foundation is there.

I am not that far in the game.  So you join up with this drunken mouthy jackass who is pretty annoying but does provide the only humor/comic relief in the game.  And theres some other ""immortal"" chick with an awesome rack.

Well despite being immortal I'm finding it super easy to die on the first boss.  You and your immortal chick seem not to be immortal whatsoever and you die easily.  The first boss will just devastate you.  Only thing I can think of to do is to go back and grind for like 5 more levels until I get a ""heal 2"" spell... if that will even happen...  So basically the boss will wreck your s*** and do 140-300 damage a turn to everyone in your party.  Why is this a problem? Because that is most of your HP and you can only heal one person at a time for 100 hp a turn, which also wastes your turn of course.  Do the math.  Its immensely frustrating and probably where most stop playing this game.  It may explain why I got a like new copy for 10 bucks.

Got a couple other things to say.  The circle target damage boost thing and whole ring system, is basically worthless.  If you want to cause a whole 8 points more damage go ahead and use it.  Really repetitive.  The defensive spells are equally weak and not worth using.

If I can grind past the first boss it may be a good game it surely has potential.  The thing about it is, I have already done alot of grinding up to this boss, much more than most people would, and still am dying, so you may need some serious patience to get thru the bosses of this game",first impressions,1401753600,2,,

4.0,True,"10 24, 2015",A1ZU6402AN5DPG,B00H45K6KS,DeltaPenguin,"Alright, so I've played a number of the Atelier games (Mana Khemia [excellent], some of Mana Khemia 2, Atelier Totori, Atelier Meruru, Atelier Ayesha, 7-10 hours of Atelier Shallie, and of course this one (about 80%))

I like to review the game from the gameplay mechanics standpoint. Here's how the game rates with the other games in mind (note, this is the second game of the Dusk trilogy, and Atelier Ayesha was the first of the trilogy.  Can be played out of order, story tends to be a bit weaker in this series):

Story/Characters 7.6 - The personalities and English VA are above average (idk about the Japanese VA).  Some characters from Ayesha make a return, but not all of them are playable.  I liked the clothing designs of Ayesha better, but the designs all still look good in this game.  Per the story, there isn't much to it, you can choose from 2 protagonists (Escha, a hard working, somewhat naive/sheltered local girl from town who is a beginner in alchemy, or Logy, a more serious fellow from Central City) and you are solving quests to help make the town better and eventually reach/explore some unexplored ruins.  There may've been more to it, but I can't recall at this time.  For this series, the story is weaker, but the character interactions tend to be the more exciting part of the game.  I liked the characters presented here, and they go well together, but I think the character interactions are stronger/ more entertaining in Totori and Ayesha.

+ Wilbell returns
+ shop girl Katla's debut

Graphics 8.7 - Maintains the dusk atmosphere well, moreso then Ayesha.  I don't know if I can explain it technically correct, but colors are darker and more muted, but still very vibrant/standoutish.  All the character models look fantastic (see a youtube video) and look like detailed and colorful cell shading.  The environments all suit the more ~serious/muted tone of the game from the previous game, but thinking about it, the story itself does not feel like it has a serious tone/urgency to it, so it is a bit of a mismatch.  I like the graphics slightly less than Ayesha, Ayesha had some environment where the colors contrasted very well (looked very good being muted with the slight brighter colors that were there).

Gameplay: 8.3
The gameplay has some improvements from the previous entries of the series.  The atelier games have a large focus on item collection, creation and customization.  This game is no different, but has refined their alchemy crafting system to an even higher quality, making it more user friendly and easier to understand what each material's effects are.  Summarized points below:

+ like Ayesha, pressing Select will provide helpful tips for any property or item you have a question on
++ interesting and simple system for combining, presented in a clear manner so you know how much and what kinds of elements you get from each item.  There are 4 elements you can have per item (fire, water, earth, wind), and having a certain number of points in an element will give you special abilities that can be used to enhance the equipment.  Very well done.
~ - so many combinations, which are good, but because there is so much variety, after you level up high enough you can pretty much get/use any elemental ability you want when done right.  The flexibility is good, but it may've been made a bit too easy to get good stats (over time).  ~May decrease the challenge/satisfaction of creating a fantastic item.
++ not all properties transfer to certain items, previously the system did not tell you when a property (from an item being used to create the new item) would appear on the new item.  This has been corrected and is extremely helpful.
+ like ayesha, when you create an item it usually creates multiple of that item, saves time as opposed to only creating 1 item each time (plus, you can use earth element ability to increase the quantity of items gathered)

Other points per gameplay:
+ like Ayesha, can duplicate most items / materials (through the ...homonculi? litte furry creatures), helpful to ensure you don't get stuck somewhere
~+ monthly allowance helps with getting money, though everything is so expensive that this is kind of required
~+ like Ayesha, the speed stat is not overpowered as in previous games, but it's value may've been nerfed too much
~ carry items are restricted again (can't carry groups of items like in Ayesha)
++ depending on tasks completed. get development points to improve the team's ability to gain experience, collect items faster, travel in fewer days, etc.  It is a GREAT idea to keep these key items separate from the normal item creation process, to highlight their importance.  In past games, if you forgot or just did not know that said items could/should be created, you'd be at a severe disadvantage in trying to complete tasks on time (an important aspect of these games, especially previous ones)
+ more diverse assist actions in battle makes battle interesting (allows other characters to attack out of turn for extra damage)
+ the timing and flow of battle is well done (for assist actions, and not moving/transitioning the camera too quickly), and the battles are pretty quick
+ all usable items become equipment, and are replenished when returning to town.  This is handy as it lets you create one good item, and just use that (over wasting time creating multiple of said item)
- the battles are kind of repetitive after awhile.  They usually consist of the protagonists using strong items, then everyone Assist Attacking.  They are still fun, but could've been better.
++ time restrictions have been relaxed, there is one main goal per each season (4 months = 120days), with 8 other important goals (for item/stat rewards), and 16 other optional goals.  It is very relaxing if you only take the primary goal, but there is still leeway such that completing all goals can still net in 60-90days sometimes of extra time.
- each season's goals, and taking on standard collection/hunting quests, can get pretty repetitive and tedious.  While the time pressure is not very strong, it feels like you just quest all the time, which is a downside to this series.  A stronger more central story would be preferred over repetitive cycle of tasks here.
- probably 80% same enemy models from previous games, another downside to the quick release schedule of this series
- notation on items is confusing.  For an effect, it appears that the order is L M S XS from weakest to greatest, but many would tend to think S = Small and that that would be the weaker effect.  Can press Select to see the effect's description when in doubt.
- some lag in the standard cutscenes, scrolling in environments

Overall score: 8.2
I'd say this game is among the best of the series in terms of the crafting system and general gameplay features, but the combat and activities are more repetitive feeling, and the characters, while good, are not as standout-ish as Ayesha.  It could use a stronger story to give more meaning and purpose to your adventure and stronger ties for the characters, but that's in general something the series could work on.  The graphics are still outstanding, and the relaxed time frame is in general a plus for the series, they just need to find a way to keep narrative strong and moving forward, and the to be tasks interesting, regardless of the time pressure.

Another small point, which I noticed in some past games as well, is that sometimes cutscenes will occur (based on the date/time that passes) can interrupt the flow of an item you are synthesizing (creating).  Occurred a few times in this game as well.  Might be nice to queue the events when possible so that it does not interrupt the player's workflow.

Also, the opening music/intro seemed kind of random.  The more dramatic opening of Shallie was much more appealing (musically, at least).

The questions are generally easy (similar to the real game) spanning from basic science and history to sports and pop culture.

Everyone answers every question (unlike in Jeopardy and Wheel, where you wait your turn to play) and each full game lasts 15-20 minutes.

There doesn't seem to be any scaling of question difficulty in multiplayer party mode.  For example, the $100 questions seem equally difficult as the $500,000 questions. There are also no lifelines during party mode and you can miss questions and still stay in the game (you'll just drop down a dollar value level when you miss a question.)

In solo mode, you retain the original 3 lifelines (ask the audience, 50-50, phone a friend) and missing a single question will end the game.  The questions seem to become increasingly difficult as you gain in dollar value levels.

I don't mind collecting things too much but in this game...thats pretty much all you do. I've never played a game with this amount of collecting, gathering and useless sidequests. It is almost absurd how redundant and repetitive these are by the time you finish the game.

Here's how the game is played

The game (world) is played on roughly 10 maps. Each map is an overland area like a mini Skyrim or Dragons Dogma ""open world"", each of them contains ""lists"" of things to do, like collecting something or finding X number of things on the map and marking them. Here's a sample of what you do on each map:

- A primary quest to complete.
- A dragon to kill.
- Collecting shards!!!! (gives you a bonus to a character stat..not worth the effort)
- Find each landmark (gives you certain game points called power and influence)
- Find each campsite (like a bonfire or checkpoint or safe zone)
- Finding all the Ocularums and Astrariums (gives you certain game points as above or a secret cave stash with loot or reveals shard locations)
- Miscellaneous minor side quests involving finding, collecting or killing something.
- Collect various miscellaneous objects like mosaics and bottles of wine or beer.

While you are doing the 10 maps you can also choose to do the main storyline quest which will take you to the midpoint of the game where you own your own castle called Skyhold. You can deck it out somewhat and it reminds me a little of Suikoden but sadly its not exactly as involved as that since there aren't many characters in Skyhold that do anything useful IMO. There is also a war table (world map) where you have your agents do things like auto collecting material for you or unlock additional maps (out of the 10). These things require power which you gain while playing the game. By the time you finish the game your war table or world map will be completely filled in.

The second half of the game is more of the same until you beat it. Unfortunately your character isn't as memorable as say past Dragon Age games IMO and certain older characters seem to be shoe horned in where it could have easily been anyone else, having some of these older characters show up simply answers the old FAQ: ""Where are they now?"". Their parts just seem brief and generic even though they are placed in critical situations in various parts of the main story.

As negative as this review sounds the game is still Dragon Age with lots of stories to tell, maps to explore and a few dungeons (I was hoping for more) to conquer. Also there are quite a bit of dragons to kill that are pretty difficult to take down if you are under powered and the crafting system is rather well done. If you spend time with crafting you can make yourself much better weapons and armor than what you will find. Character skills and skill trees are OK, some of them were really cool and others seemed pretty useless but overall it gives you a wealth of options to customize a character to suit your style. The game is also filled with dialogue, cut scenes, stories, romances, books and other things to do with your companions that they grow on you and by the end of the game I'm happy to say Bioware successfully made a game that makes up for the travesty IMO that was Dragon Age II.

I beat this game and its DLC, completed every quest and collected almost every item and I can firmly give this 4 stars. If your a Dragon Age fan do yourself a favor and buy the game and keep in mind two things: Do not bother with collecting everything cause you will go insane and get to Skyhold (do the main quests early on), with that in mind you will probably have a much better time than I did.

Compared to the G600, the UtechSmart's side buttons are a little harder to press than the G600's. Might cause some cramping in weaker thumb muscles. Also, the G600's buttons are a little easier to distinguish between each other by touch than the UtechSmart's. The UtechSmart's buttons do have a nice clicky feel to them. The thumb rest on the UtechSmart also makes the bottom row of buttons slightly less accessible than the G600 where no thumb rest exists.

Another slight ""con"" I have is that the lights are just a bit too bright on the UtechSmart, even on the lowest setting. Which could be a problem for some in darker conditions.

I personally loved knocking over the games (over 100) towns and bases, with machine guns, helicopters, and rocket launchers, it's fun as hell, and this game is all about that. I never got bored of parachuting in and raising hell.
The grappling hook (and all the parachute mechanics) works much better than in Just Cause 2; and no timed missions (that ruined Just Cause 2 for me) (actually there are four minor timed missions, to turn off ""monitoring stations"" but they don't ruin the game at all) to stop the game (as in Just Cause 2) and stop the player from progressing. And plenty of ammo. Again, unlike the Just Cause 2 that made getting ammo very hard.
The main story is hard at the end (like mission 11). I was unable to complete the last few missions, but it did not detract from the game. The open world provides 50 hours of game play or more. Very fun. Graphics do slow down at times, but does not ""break"" the game. Never a freeze.",A big step up from Just Cause 2. Worth playing. Real open world.,1492041600,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I know the PS2 has its problems like the graphics are worse than the first Xbox and Gamecube,but the system has a lot of great games. The Xbox quit early because a lot of companies went straight to Sony and Gamecube never really had that many games they did not want any violent games and focus on Gameboy advance and DS.

The best thing about the Playstation 2 is that it has very type of game that is popular like Final Fantasy 10,Time Crisis 2&3,Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,Devil May Cry 1,2,&3,Midnight Club 3, and many other games. I prefer a PS2 over PS3 any day because the point of PS2 is the huge library of games and PS3 doesn't have any games that I want to get. I own every brand console Dreamcast,N64,PS2,Snes,Psone,and Xbox 360 so I am not biased I just like great games that are made well,part of the problem is that the companies take longer to make because they could go out of business if they don't sell enough games so they only release something that will sell something like Halo 3 or Final Fantasy.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the puzzles are generally easy.  As psychiatrist David McNamara, most of the gameplay lies in playing audio clips of patients' sessions in order to stimulate the other patients' memories.  It's usually pretty easy to figure out what clip you need to play, and to whom, but the clips are all short so it's not a big inconvenience if you accidentally pick the wrong one.  Once you stimulate the patient's memory, you go into his or her memory and actually play as the patient, which is a pretty cool device.  The flashback puzzles are more varied, but they're still pretty easy.  In most cases, your location and inventory are so limited that you can't help but figure out what to do.  I have to give credit, though, because the puzzles are all pretty logical and use real-world objects, so don't worry about having to open any antique puzzle boxes or anything like that.

The backstory of what happened to the patients is okay, but a bit hackneyed.  It won't take most people long to figure out what happened to the kids.  I could forgive that if the characters were a little more interesting, but sadly, the patients are all pretty bland.  That makes sense when you first meet them in the mental hospital, but as you go into the backstory (the flashbacks unfold in reverse chronology, ""Memento""-style), the characters should have become more distinct, and they just didn't.

What saved the game for me, though, was David McNamara.  He's easily the best adventure game character I've come across in a long time, and the side plot about David's personal demons and imploding marriage was far more interesting than what happened at the hospital.  David isn't always a nice guy, but that's part of what makes him such a good character.  There were a couple of times when I cringed at his actions, and one point where I flat-out tried to stop him from doing something (without success), but he is definitely the most interesting part of the game.

Despite the game's subtitle, there's not as much violence as you might expect.  There are a few murders, although you only see one of them happen.  There is one disturbing part of the game where you're forced to commit an act of violence, and even though it made sense, I still had a hard time going through with it.  Still, unless you're very sensitive, that shouldn't stop you from playing this game.

Overall, I enjoyed Overclocked.  The gameplay was logical, and the story ranged from ""okay"" to ""compelling.""  Most of the voice acting was quite good, and the backgrounds were sparse but appropriately gloomy.  The ending was mostly satisfactory, although there were a few loose ends, and the very last scene was a big ""huh?"" moment.

My initial thoughts: If you can get NBA Live for half price ($30), it is the better game!

So, why would I say that?  NBA Live does not have ANY edit features and NO share roster or share player options.  But, NBA Live 15 is awesome in the court display and is equal and in some cases superior to NBA 2k15 on player models and flow of the game as I really like the feel of the play.  NBA Live 15 also falls short on teams available as there are ZERO classic teams and so far I can't find a mode that allows me to become a star using classic players ...

Longtime fans of the series will be happy to know that the game has improved over last year's game and leaps and bounds better than 14. It offers users new, exciting ways to play in some areas while not making much progress in others.

One of the modes in NBA LIVE 16 where I think you will have a lot of fun is Live Pro-Am. You can create your own virtual self using the GameFace HD. The great thing about this new feature is you don't have to have Kinect for Xbox One users or a PlayStation 4 Camera for PS4 gamers.

 You just download the NBA Live companion app to your smartphone or tablet. The app is free of charge. Once you create your character, you can then dress him in the many types of shoes and other accessories the game has to offer. The more you play, the more reward points you can earn to unlock even more stuff to add to your collection. You can also add tattoos to your created player. There are many types of tattoos to chose from so there's something for everyone. They have been created by Randy Harris, who has done art work on actual NBA players over the years.

Likes:

Gameplay is improving with each release of the game which is a good sign for the overall series. It's the best it has been since the relaunch of the series.

Online Team Play Mode: You can team up with your friends and play on many types of courts to chose from.

Graphics: Like gameplay, the graphics seem to be improving on a yearly basis. Still not perfect, but player models look good.

Dislikes:

No historical teams: I always have enjoyed playing real life teams from yesteryear. Sadly, this isn't an option in NBA Live 16. It does have the ever popular Ultimate Team Mode that lets you collect players from different eras of the NBA, but no way of unlocking teams from the past.

Dynasty and Rising Star Modes are pretty much the same as last year's game. In order to keep pace with other sports games like NBA 2K, FIFA, Madden, etc, EA is going to have to work more in creating new content for these modes.

Giving players basically  the same thing as last year's game is going to leave a sour taste in gamer's mouths.

Overall, you can tell the game is not just a roster update of NBA Live 15. The franchise needs to continue to grow by updating existing modes while still trying new things to try and stay on the cutting edge of video basketball games.",My review of NBA Live 16 on XBox One.,1443916800,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"12 21, 2007",A2PQBEWW2Q03V7,B000HCMR8E,Bob Manson,"RR7 is the logical next step in the Ridge Racer series, and is the best one so far. But, like most of the RR games, not without its flaws.

Ridge Racer has never been about realism. The physics are about as ridiculous as it gets, the ""nitrous"" feature is really a rocket boost, wrecks don't damage your car, etc. RR is about fun, fast, aggressive driving, and is much easier to master than a ""real"" simulation like the GT series.

Graphically the game is superb, highly detailed cars and beautiful scenery. It has occasional frame rate problems, particularly when sliding through turns with several other cars in the turn--fortunately this hasn't been a problem so far. But I'd honestly prefer a solid framerate over great graphics.

The past few RR games have added new features (RR5 included ""drafting""). In RR7 you earn money by winning races, and can then buy new cars and various car upgrades. A much better approach than the all-too-linear progression in previous games, as it gives you control over which cars get upgraded. It's nothing like the overly-complex car setup/tweaking in DiRT or GT, but it's fully in line with RR's theme of ""keep it simple, keep it fun"".

A major focus of RR7 is on online play. I miss the story mode from RRT4, as campy as it was--especially as I'm not interested in online competition. The online rankings might be interesting, except people have obviously found ways to cheat and inflate their numbers to unrealistic/unbeatable scores.

A female announcer/copilot?! I think this is a positive change. The previous series' commentators were downright obnoxious and I always ended up turning them off.

If you enjoyed the previous games you'll like this one, although it is a bit more complicated and I think the focus on online play is unfortunate. If you're new to the series, just keep in mind it's not about real cars or real racing and I think you'll enjoy it.","Unrealistic, insanely fun driving game",1198195200,3,,

Hill,"We played Pirates! back on the old Commodore 64 and it was one of our favorite games of all time, so we were thrilled when we saw that there was a release for the PC. This plays a lot like the original game and is still an exceptionally fun game.

The basic goal of the game is to rise as high as possible by building a reputation, wealth, and completing missions for various leaders (governors, priests, etc).

Your reputation will be important as you attempt to impress the various governor's daughters (ultimately seeking the hand of one in marriage). Dancing with the daughters is very important and you will need to do it a lot, but it is also the one aspect of the game that I don't like as it does get somewhat repetitive.

There are several basic ways to get wealth, but preying on ships of whatever country is at war with yours is one of the fastest. I really enjoy the ship to ship and captain to captain combat that is involved in capturing other ships, but watch out for the pirate hunters that seek you out when you become more famous. You can also gather pieces of treasure maps that will lead to hordes of gold, but that generally takes more time.

Like all Pirate captains, you do have to make some tough choices and worry about keeping your crew happy (or you might find yourself on the wrong end of a mutiny).

This is an addictive game that can be played over and over but one complaint from my daughter is that you can only be a male in the game.

All these years later I've just picked it up, second hand, for the N64. And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version, which is a good thing!

The only difference is in the movies. The PC and I 'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form, where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves. I have no complaint about it, I like it wether it's video form, or 3D poly form. They both still tell the same story. Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal, he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask!!!! shame thats not in it.

All the codes and moves where the same, and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves, fatalitys and weapens etc... tho, i'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts, which makes it great to just go into the options, highlight ""continues #"" and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.

The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included. It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK: TRILOGY (All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality (2 fats, freindship, babality etc..) that about it.

This game is one of the best head to head fighter games. Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system... talk about over kill... but they didn't wanna make one for the 64, so thats there loss, which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.

This game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that, which makes it better then the arcade. Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot, and a skinless character named Meat (go to GameFaq,com for the codes)

I own a G9 and wrote a prior review for it, indicating it was a fine game mouse which includes a corded laser driven sensor system, on board customizable memory, a cool weight addition system which is not a gimmick--I definitely have a preference for a heavy mouse, customizable LED colors, and a nice scroll wheel.  The two changeable grips are great -- you will probably have a preference for one or the other depending on how you use your mouse.  The G9 is a nicely constructed, accurate, pleasure to use, feature heavy game mouse, and fully capable of use in any application including games.  But, this is not a review on the G9, but rather the G9x... or is it?

The G9x is exactly the same mouse, with exactly the same construction and feature set, except for one thing....  let me quote the Logitech feature blurbs:  First, for the G9x, ""the G9x extends the promise of the award-winning Logitech G9 Laser Mouse with its next-generation laser sensor... On-the-fly adjustable dpi to go from pixel-precise targeting (200 dpi) to lightning-fast maneuvers (up to 5000 dpi).""  And for the G9, ""Get uncompromised speed and accuracy from a high-performance Gaming-Grade Laser Engine (adjustable 200 dpi - 3200 dpi)""  This apparently is the only difference.  An increase from 3200 dpi max for the G9 up to 5000 dpi for the G9x.

My own max speed for playing games without too much twitching is 2500 dpi, and most often I prefer lower speeds.  I would never realize the full speed of the G9x, just as I have not realized the full speed of the G9.  I do not notice any functional differences playing Crysis, Call of Duty 4, F.E.A.R. series, Fallout 3, or any other fast paced games.

I love both of these mice, but I have to ask the question, at about $60 for the G9, and $100 for the G9x, is the G9x worth another $40 over the G9?  I guess if you do the math, 5000 dpi over 3200 dpi is a 56% increase in speed.  The $40 premium for the G9x is 66% over the prior price for the G9.

You can make your own decision, but I think the price point for this new mouse is higher than it should be.  The G9 and G9x are great mice.  Buy whichever one is cheaper, they are exactly the same, and provide exactly the same general features, except for max dpi.",G9x vs G9? Worth the upgrade?,1256083200,103,,

I'm happy to announce that it deserves all the praise it got! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited to Icicle Creek Lodge by it's owner, Chantal, to figure out why all these bad things have been happening at the lodge. Guests have been checking out because of the horrible luck of the lodge, such as slashed tires, explosions, food poisoning, and icy stairs. After each accident happens, a mysterious white wolf starts to howl, causing lots of guests to think the wolf is haunted. The plot was really great and unique. Since Nancy is there undercover, she gets to do lots of snooping around (including in the guest's rooms!). Overall the plot was tons of fun and really well executed!

CHARACTERS - 5/5: There were lots of characters, and lots of character interaction, which is always great! The hotel's guests include Ollie, the hotel's handyman, Yanni, a fancy foreign skier, Guadalupe, a bird watcher, Bill, an ice fisher, and Lou, a college student. All of the characters had their own personalities and incriminating evidence against them, so I really couldn't guess who the culprit was. Plus, I loved how the characters moved around, in fact, a couple of them even check out.

SETTING - 5/5: The game was set in Alberta, Canada. The graphics were really great, especially the mountains in the background. And the lodge was really cozy and realistic.  The music was also really nice.

PUZZLES - 4/5: There was a good variety of puzzles in this game. Since Nancy is working undercover as a maid and cook, she gets to go into the guest's rooms. A lot of people complained about the cooking and cleaning, but it was actually kind of fun. Cleaning the rooms literally took only a couple of seconds, and the cooking was really easy. Plus it made the game more realistic. The other puzzles were also good. Some of them were really easy, and some of them were pretty challenging. The only puzzle that really bothered me was Fox and Geese, it was kind of like Chinese Checkers, only it was really difficult and boring. You have to win it 3 times 3 different ways, which got frustrating, unfortunately.

IS IT CHALLENGING?: Kind of. The only really hard puzzle was Fox and Geese, and it wasn't so difficult as it was boring. But for challenge, I'd probably give the game a 3.5

ENDING - 3.5/5: The ending was OK. The culprit was surprising, and their motive made sense. But catching them was exactly the same as in Secret of the Old Clock (#12), you chase them until their vehicle crashes. I kind of wish they had a more unique ending. Also, there were some loose ends about the other characters.

The explosions and vehicles in this game rival any so far. The missions are all pretty fun and vary between a variety of different activities for a variety of different factions. The weapons are all fun to shoot and the vehicles are all fun to drive. Luckily, all the things I just mentioned are done in such an awesome manner that it is fairly easy to ignore the bad points in this game.

Bad Points: The ending is crap. You would think there would be something a little more thought out after the Americans and Chinese fight for oil in Venezuela. I won't tell you the ending that I saw, but I'll tell you this. It lasts all of less than half a minute and is a non-event. Another bad point is the voice acting which is just EXTREMELY annoying. It makes you want to kill all of the NPCs. On an island that headquarters the Jamaican faction all of the npc's say ""hey mon"" as you pass by. Sometimes they add a couple of words like ""mercenary"" before the phrase, but come on. What a cliche. The Australian girl at PMC headquarters has a very annoying voice also. It's like an Aussie Fran Dreshcer (not sure about spelling) that nags you whenever you mess up a mission.

Anyhow, for all my complaints (and I do have a few more) this game is A LOT of fun.

Gondhalekar,"Our family has only done one workout so far, but I wanted to get my thoughts out  regarding the game to help any potential buyers.  I picked up the game based on the positive reviews on Amazon so far, and I think the good points stated there are generally correct.  I did my workout for the day on medium intensity while my wife chose the beginner intensity.  I've been working out with EA Sports Active for about three months on and off now, and I found the Biggest Loser medium workout to be a bit more challenging than the typical hard 30 day challenge workouts required on EA Sports Active.  I find the typical EA Sports Active workouts to be significantly emphasizing the lower body with tons of squats, lunges, jumps, and runs thrown at you each day. Generally I can keep up to begin with, but over time my legs and quads get tired providing the overall degree of difficulty.  The workouts on the Biggest Loser seem a lot more oriented towards whole body with a lot of work done with arms and the core muscles than in EA Sports Active.  Without the resistance band, the overall intensity of each routine is not quite as high as EA Sports Active, but the workouts went for a lot longer, and there were a lot of activities with very little breather/equipment change break between them.  As a result by the end of the workout I was not able to do some of the required workouts true to form, and had to do things like jumping jacks just standing up.  I was pretty well exhausted by the end of the routine with a lot of sweat being shed.  The warm up and cool down in the game were also far more extensive than EA Sports Active, which just seems to do a halfhearted lip service to both.  The game also seemed to use the balance board far more extensively, and in a better manner than EA Sports Active.

That being said, there were some negative aspects about this that bugged me a bit.  I am used to the way EA Sports active is set up by now, with every repetition being demanded to be done in the expected manner, and then represented on screen by the movements of your avatar.  This game did not seem to demand that of me, with the blue bar at the bottom and the accolades being given being rather vague representations of how well you were doing.  The trainer and the contestant I chose seemed to be merrily doing pre-scripted animation, whether I kept up or not.

The game also does not seem to use the nunchuck at all so far (and refused to continue if you have it plugged in), and does not really try read the relative positions of your limbs like the leg strap setup of EA Sports Active does.  When I was doing the jumping jacks without jumping due to fatigue, the game was only looking at the Wiimote in my hands, and the blue bar was maxed out.  This would never be permitted with the leg strap reading the nunchuck.  I also found the calories burned figure to be way different than what EA Sports Active calculates, with only 80 calories reportedly burned in a 37 minute medium intensity workout.  A similar workout in EA Sports Active typically reports 200+ calories burned.  While I have no proof who is right, I tend to believe the EA Sports number more closer to reality based on the fact that you burn 95 calories an hour just sitting and watching TV, and almost 400 calories an hour doing low intensity work like mowing the lawn.  I also found the menu system in this game to be needlessly twitchy, with me picking the wrong options on occasion due to the Wiimote moving during a button press.  Overall this is going to be a good to excellent addition to our fitness game library.  People who get frustrated with the demanding input requirements of active will like the looser loser inputs better.  And if you switch back and forth between those two and throw in Wii Fit Plus for some fun activities, you will have a lot of different options at your disposal.  I am looking forward to how Ubisoft Your Shape and EA Sports Active More Workouts stack up to the challenge to set themselves apart in the fitness game field now getting crowded.","Seems like a good workout so far, but not perfect",1255046400,22,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

With so much hype, I got S2 Day-One as I had never played the original. To be honest, I thought it was slightly above mediocre. I had more fun with the single player than playing competitive multiplayer.

The graphics are nice, menus are slick, and the three classes are very distinct and balanced. There's no one obviously 'better' class, which is something I cannot say for just about every game out there. Overall, the game feels polished. The menus and game have been updated for added intuitiveness. Despite this, I just couldn't play it for long hours. There was just no 'hook' for me to get sucked in and want to learn all the strengths and weaknesses of all the units, etc.

The DRM with Blizzard games really don't bother me. The games have such a good community surrounding them that I think I may even prefer it. I can log in anywhere that has the game downloaded and play my account.

For less than $40, I think it is well worth a try. RTSs and this game in general has a very wide demographic. It is widely loved, so I think just about anyone can get some enjoyment out of it.","Worth it for the price, but overrated",1363478400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"07 23, 2010",A3OOIS6U00QJJX,B000WQWPOQ,Dev,"If you have watched trailer for this game, we can all agree this game looks awesome. Since I like open world games, I decided to give this one a shot. After finishing the game on normal difficulty and finishing about 90% of the total missions (~20-25 hrs) below is what I thought about the game.

PROS.

POWERS ARE AWESOME: Just as you may remember from the trailers, you get access to a variety of weapons. These include but are not limited to claws, hammer hands, a whip lass, sweet a$$ blade etc. Along with weapons you also get access to defensive powers such as shields and cocoons and special powers such as thermal and infection visions and morphing capability. Best part here is most of these powers are upgradable giving this game an RPG type characteristics and promoting the player to complete more missions and get more points

ACCESS TO WEAPONS AND VEHICLES: Other than powers described above, you also have access to military weapons such as rifles and rocket launchers and vehicles such as armored tank and fighter chopper. Like your powers, you can also upgrade your skills to use these weapons and vehicles effectively.

CUTSCENES ARE SPECTACULAR: I can't say much without spoiling here, but cutscenes are nicely designed and are fun to watch.

DECENT VARIETY IN MISSIONS: Different missions will require you to use different powers and skills differently making them interesting. Majority (~60%) of the story missions are well designed and will keep you engaged.

GREAT FREE ROAMING EXPERIENCE: I love how you can roam around the town and massacre enemies with different powers. For such experience, I can't think of any other game.

CONS.

STORY IS RATHER WEAK: You get to see most of the story by completing main missions and remainder of the story by absorbing targeted individuals. While it has some shocking suspense, the story is portrayed rather abruptly and if you don't absorb some people at the right time, you can be really confused what the hell is going on.

ABSORBING ENEMIES IS PAIN IN THE A$$: At first it feels cool, but after 2 hours, it becomes horribly redundant. The major way you can replenish your energy is by absorbing enemies and by the time you finish the game, you will hate absorbing the enemies over and over and over again. Also for some reason, every time you die, it only replenish half of your health, the rest you have to gain by absorbing a single enemy at a time.

ENEMIES LACK VARIETY: Your enemies are military personals and vehicles; infected humans and superhumans. While it is initially fun massacring them, after about 4-6 hours, it becomes terribly boring face them over and over and over again.

BOSSES ARE HORRIBLE: This is my biggest complain. They give you so many awesome powers; however, other than one particular boss, I found rest of the boss fights really dull. A lot of these bosses will have you fight the same enemies over and over again. JUST TERRIBLE.

SOME MISSIONS ARE JUST HORRIBLE: Later on in the game, there are few missions that will make this experience very miserable. A good example is you have to destroy certain machines in later on mission. These machines are in an area covered with deadly gas and under strict military surveillance. It took me a long while just to distinguish these machines from other structures in the area and afterwards it took me a while to destroy them thanks to aiming system in this game. There are other missions similar to this that will get you confused.

THE LOCK ON SYSTEM IN POORLY DESIGNED: Using different military vehicles is great; however, it is difficult to lock on certain targets with these vehicles thanks to poor lock on system in this game. Right analogue stick is used for both changing targets and changing camera view making lock on very difficult. A good example is the mission I described in the above con.

THE GAME HAS GLITCHES: It truly breaks my heart to say this, but I encountered terrible glitches. You are capable of using one offensive and one defensive power at the same time. I am fighting the final boss and what happens?? I can't first use any of them. I die. Afterwards I can only use one power (either offensive or defensive) at a time. And when I use defensive power, I can't use the offensive one. I tried turning on/off system, restarting from previous check point, nothing fixed the glitch. While I was still able to finish the game with this glitch, it made things terribly difficult. JUST TERRIBLE.

All and all for what this game allows you to do (powers and vehicles), it is a great game; however, its flaws prevents it from being enjoyable at times. I think they had great concept in mind, but failed to execute it properly. However, if you are bored and feel like just free roaming in an open world and massacring enemies, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

Pure has insane graphics and beautiful scenery. The music is upbeat without being inappropriate for a young crowd. I am disappointed that it is not multiplayer, but single player is definitely a blast. It consists of three race modes; Race, Sprint, and Freestyle. All are fun.
I had hoped that Pure would be similar to ATV Offroad Fury (PS2). I love to free roam and create my own paths. Sadly, Pure does not allow you to free roam at all. There are multiple routes that you can explore, but I was still disappointed.
I learned to love creating my own ATV in this game, and the good thing is you end up being able to create about 9 of them. Lots of colors and styles to choose from.
The jumps and tricks are insanely unreal, but who cares, that is why I play games. I'm too chicken to do stuff in real life, so Pure offered a way for me to get some big air and do some sweet tricks.

4.0,False,"11 6, 2012",A1YEX6N706QU2V,B0050SYX8W,Zach,"Finish the fight. Five years on, the misguided marketing hook for Halo 3 still irks those who stuck with Bungie's strung-out storytelling and cryptic iambic prophesying only to find that the climax didn't deliver. The war might have been won (honestly, it was hard to tell) but our hero was left drifting in distant space. It wasn't an end, it was an abandonment.

The most important thing that Halo's new guardians at 343 Industries get right is a return to the fictional foundations of the original. Master Chief is our hero, Cortana is his unusually well-scripted AI companion, and he's fighting a war for Earth and mankind that's so unambiguous we needn't worry about his own lack of humanity - we can just get on with the precise, technologically advanced killing.

At least we could if Halo 4 would let us. The Chief's comeback might be a return to old ways - and a tacit admission that Bungie strayed into unsatisfying chin-stroking territory - but it also raises the issue of humanity early on, with a prologue cutscene regarding the original purpose of the Spartan programme.

It's an issue that doesn't go away. When we rejoin the Chief, he's been in stasis for four years, while the unsleeping Cortana has developed signs of rampancy, a form of AI dementia. She is losing her mind, and the awoken Chief sets out to save it by returning her to Earth - the augmented superman and his artificial soul on an odyssey home.

The major obstacle to this homecoming is a Forerunner planet, which pulls the pair's derelict ship to its surface, where they discover a great threat to mankind. It's of the kind that's big enough to merrily drive an uncomplicated narrative, and the sort that other sequels have lacked. Our heroes also encounter a new race of enemies called Prometheans. Their design parallels the three-tiered structure of the Covenant, with towering Knights looking very much like semi-digital Elites, joined on the battlefield by fluttering drones and, in the place of the comical Grunts, packs of canine units with weaponised heads.

The colourful Forerunner planet doesn't feel like retreading old ground so much as a welcome reminder that in a series capable of taking us anywhere in the universe we should expect more than earthy brown and starship grey
As the image of exploding robot dogs probably gives away, the Prometheans are not an unqualified triumph. In their similarity to the Covenant, 343 has played it safe, and there's something less than engaging about disposing of enemies made of energy rather than recoiling, crumpling flesh. That said, things improve when their backstory is revealed, and they are at all times more enjoyable than the happily absent Flood.

Not absent are the Covenant themselves, who seem to have returned out of convenience more than anything else. They're here to wake Master Chief with a familiar face and give the delayed Promethean entrance a little more weight, as well as to ensure their range of plasma weapons remain available to our hero. They may tag along, but the game is still better for them, providing a reliable ingredient in the pitched battles set in rocky pathways, pristine corridors and open battlegrounds that are Halo 4's central pleasure.

If this sounds like the formula of Halo: Combat Evolved, that seems to be the plan. Halo 4 might not recapture the wonder of that first ringworld, but it's not for want of trying. The game presents us with another mysterious environment in the Forerunner planet, which is at first pointedly drab - as if making a glib comment on Halo 3's muddy Flood bowels - before exploding into a series of lush, colourful scenes.

The trump card is the same as always: a sense of solidarity in movement and aiming that makes weighty sense of fighting through the bio-enhanced body of a supersoldier. And Halo 4's focus is tightly pulled onto close-quarters encounters, highlighting this kinetic accomplishment. The grand staged battles favoured by the preceding sequels are gone, replaced by tightly mapped fights with small clusters of Prometheans and Covenant; the lessons of Assault On The Control Room have been learnt and are repeatedly put into practice.

Not that things are exactly the same: Master Chief's choice of weaponry has expanded. An inclusive approach means the punchy, hierarchy-inverting pistol appears alongside its erstwhile replacements, the Battle Rifle and DMR, while the Promethean arsenal provides shotgun, rifle and sniper variants. The increased range of rechargeable power-ups has a greater tactical impact, though. These now boast a front-facing hard light shield and a Promethean sentry bot to be selected alongside the existing hologram, jet pack and power of invisibility, depending on your preference.

If Spartan Ops is a replacement for Firefight, then its first showing recaptures little of that mode's tense sense of escalation. That said, there's lots of promise here, and room enough to grow its tale into a compelling yarn
These powers are also the focal point of a multiplayer game that's slowly losing its identity. The bold, simple template of old featured no variable loadouts and no rechargeable powers, instead relying on a beautifully balanced weapon set and accomplished controls. This slowly eroding system has now been nudged a little closer to frenetic Call Of Duty standards thanks to the inclusion of sprinting for all players, item drops as a reward for kill streaks, and customisable loadouts. At the core remains the solid, steady hand of Halo, but those hoping Halo 4 would roll back Reach's intricacies and deliver an alternative to the current wave of console shooters will be disappointed.

Still, if there's work to be done with the multiplayer then Halo 4's campaign, and thus the series' overall sense of purpose, is back on track. Perhaps resolving just one problem at a time is the most we can expect. 343 Industries has certainly done that; Halo 4 isn't a reinvention so much as a recalibration, a common-sense repair to a drifting narrative, with a hero who is now back in play and back at his best. Halo 4's biggest victory is that it gives us Master Chief back.",Finish the fight... again,1352160000,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The franchise offers some of the most thrilling moments in gaming, letting you scale massive buildings and use stealth to take down enemies undetected. But theres so much that grounds the experience; boring missions, overly complicated side activities, and stories that straddle the line between dull and nonsensical. I was lured to the franchise by the wonderful second entry, but since then, with a new Assassins Creed released every single year, sometimes accompanied by spinoff games, Ive found my interest waning. After last years drab, lifeless, bug-riddled Assassins Creed Unity, I started thinking that maybe the series wasn't for me anymore.

But then I played Assassins Creed Syndicate.

Theres no game in the series that represents my mixed feelings quite like Syndicate. Playing through Ubisofts rendition of industrial revolution-era London, I was struck by the sheer inventiveness on display; new gadgets made it more fun to zip around the city than ever, and the core assassination missions are absolutely thrilling. This is a game that, in its best moments, is as fun as Assassins Creed gets. But, despite plenty of changes, it also doesnt get away from many of the series big problems. Its a game that youll absolutely love one moment, and hate the next, but its one that I cant stop playing regardless.

Syndicate changes the formula in a few important ways. For one, it has two playable characters for the first time, twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob is the now-standard loveable rogue archetype featured in just about every AC game, while Evie is his level-headed counterpart. The two set out to London in order to free the city from an oppressive criminal mastermind, and, like in Grand Theft Auto V, you can swap between the pair at almost any point. Since the two have different styles and plans  Evie is searching for a powerful mystical object, while Jacob forms his own gang to take on their enemies  this means that there are usually multiple story threads from which to choose at any moment.

Outside of the two leads, the other big change is the setting, both in terms of time and location. Syndicate is the most modern Assassins Creed yet, and this results in two additions that dramatically change the game. One is a grappling hook-style zip line, which lets you quickly reach far-off areas. Instead of slowly climbing up a building, you can just shoot out a line and zip to the top; its especially fun as a means of escape, making you feel like Batman after you pull off an assassination. Its not the only new way of getting around. Syndicates rendition of London is filled with horse-drawn carriages, and you can commandeer one anytime you need, GTA-style. This makes the typically tedious task of getting to far-off locations much, much quicker. The story even squeezes in a few great chase sequences. Both the zipline and vehicles make the game significantly faster, and in turn more fun; you can still traverse the rooftops and climb towers, but having the option to get somewhere quickly is very welcome.

Like Paris before it, London is a beautiful city to explore. The time period feels distinct from any previous AC location, and each borough feels different from the next. Youll wander through factories and warehouses; grimy smoke stacks dominate the skyline. A dark, foggy London is an ideal setting for pulling off an assassination. Theres even a sight seeing mode, where you can ride a train (which serves as your gangs headquarters) and watch the world speed by through the window.

In addition to the architecture and vehicles itself, Londons inhabitants are an improvement of the typically milquetoast populace of previous games. Assassins Creed games have never been shy when it comes to including historical figures, but Syndicate takes things a step further by including a huge number of them. Alexander Graham Bell will create new gadgets and weapons for you, while Florence Nightingale helps you save the sick and poor. Youll go ghost hunting with Charles Dickens and save Karl Marx from would-be killers. At one point Charles Darwin helps you blow up a drug lab. Its ridiculous, but fun, and a welcome change of pace for an often overly serious franchise.

In your quest to take down the criminal network running through London, youll have to assassinate several key figures, and these missions are the centerpieces. Each one has the same basic structure: you're presented with a building filled with guards and multiple ways to reach your target. The balance between tension and excitement is why I play these games; theres nothing quite like stalking through a huge, complex building, knowing that at any moment you could be discovered. When you finally pull off the kill its incredibly satisfying, and Syndicate offers a great deal of flexibility, letting you take multiple paths to the goal.

A GAME THAT CAN PULL OFF LIGHTHEARTED JOKES DESPITE BEING ABOUT CASUAL MURDER
 Assassin's Creed Syndicate
Overall, though, Syndicates missions are very mixed. The assassinations are great, as are some of the side missions  Dickens storyline is a particular highlight  but theres also a lot of tedious filler. Youll be escorting people through the city, kidnapping others, and far too often youll be tailing a fleeing enemy, being careful not to get too close. These missions are especially frustrating because, not only are they frequently boring, but often a single tiny mistake can force you to restart from scratch.

Other frustrations remain. The controls are finicky; its easy for your highly skilled assassin to get stuck on a piece of scenery, and the context-specific controls can confuse things. During one escape, I pulled a dead driver out of a buggy so I could flee to safety from the center of a heated battle. Unfortunately, the button used to hop in the cart was the same used for picking up his dead body, so instead of getting away safely, a cop shot me while a corpse was draped around my shoulders. And while the combat is largely more fluid and intuitive than past games, I found myself overwhelmed by huge numbers of bad guys far too many times, leading to awkward, monotonous scrimmages that dragged on and on.

Similarly, while some of the self-contained missions are entertaining and well written, Syndicates story isn't especially compelling. Jacob and Evie feel more like sketches of characters rather than real people, and you never get to know them beyond their surface goals. Their quest to take control of London is convoluted and frequently uninteresting, with twists that seem obvious and villains that don't inspire much (the modern-day, sci-fi story scenes, though, are mercifully brief). Syndicate is the kind of game where you might know where you need to go and what needs to be done, but you won't really care why.

What makes Syndicate so frustrating is that these recurring issues undermine what is otherwise the most refreshing Assassins Creed game in years. Syndicate is a blast to play during its best moments, and it introduces features that dramatically improve the way an Assassins Creed game works. Its even funny, the rare game that can pull off lighthearted jokes despite primarily being about casual murder. Almost every change is for the better, but the changes don't go far enough; I spent a lot of time fighting against the same features I hated in past games. Syndicate encapsulates what I love about the franchise, and what I hate, but it also shows that Ubisoft is beginning course correction. Syndicate could just be charting a new course for Assassins Creed, but the annual franchise is one titanic ship.

You play Cole, a hunter by trade. After your father and you drop off your latest chops to a steamboat, the boat is ambushed by a fake preacher and a detachment of confederate holdouts. After your father is killed, you run to Dodge City at his instruction, carrying a silver token that earns you a deathmark. The story follows like a fairly decent western as you try to unravel your fathers history and the plot of a rogue confederate general.

Along the way, you play cards, hunt wild game, scalp bandits(or innocents), chase down outlaws, and serve as a dodge city deputy. All of these serve to increase stats and supply you with cash for gun upgrades  and other improvements. Combat is incredibly fast, and while you can easily be overwhelmed by the materialization of a dozen brigands, your matrix like quick draw powers can easily even the score, and the mechanic is theatrical enough to not ever lose its charm. Sneaking and other non-combat mechanics are rather lame and overly useless, but you'll not really notice.

Excellent game and arguably the first ""true"" must have RPG for the PS4 and XB1. If you are a fan of DA this is required play. If you are a big fan of JRPG, you won't like this game. If you love D&D, you should like this game, but I won't guarantee you'll love it as it does leave a lot to be desired. Long story short, this game is NOT better than Origins. It IS better than DA2, but depends upon the story and background of DA2 than of Origins, so just beware. You do return to Ferelden and you finally enter Orlais, but gone are Denerim, Kirkwall, Orzamar, and the vast underground of the Deep Roads. There is the pleasant ""nostalgia"" factor without recycling more of the same (as DA2 did ad nauseum ad infinitum). I enjoy this game and am addicted to it for the time being. It is not overly challenging and sadistically frustrating (Alien Isolation), but it is also not a total pushover. Newbies will like the interface better than us geezers. Honestly, I wonder if they kept the tactical mode in just to make us happy when it borders on unnecessary. The story is underwhelming, but not so much that you get bored or lose interest. I guess the main reason for the ""meh"" factor was the big bad who simply lacks the ""HOLY S***"" factor of the Origins Archdemon requiring freakin' catapults to injure. Also, I just didn't feel the same emotional attachment to the many choices I had to make in this game. Origins was full of painful decisions in which somebody always got to rip you a new one. Here, you could make a decision that would make you a royal A-hole, but you're STILL the greatest good guy in the world. That kind of makes no sense and deprives your die hard D&D fan that sense of ""hmm, but I like being Lawful Evil!!"" In that regard the Fallout games will always stomp DA. Still, a very solid effort by Bioware.

Spoiler Review Time

Okay, let me give you some background first. I love DA as a series. I bought Origins when it came out and even did the preorder which got me some sweet Blood Dragon armor that I couldn't use until much later in the game. Origins was by far a game-changer for me. Blew my hair back and put some permanent circles on my plasma TV from the character portraits. I've logged so many hours playing Origins, DA2, and now DA:I that I seriously need to reconsider the next TV I get such to avoid further disaster.

So I'm in the middle of my second play through, as I've beaten the game on ""normal"" difficulty and now am attempting ""hard."" Needless to say the hard setting is still way too easy as most enemies suffer my wrath without causing too much of a headache. Early on it tends to be a bit more difficult (That Envy demon can be a real pain) since you don't have many choices until you finish certain quests (The sack of Haven) which advance the story. If you blow through those events at the recommended levels you get access to MANY more items and upgrades (the specializations) which in turn make the game, well, easy. I played the first game on normal and didn't use a strategy guide, so I missed a lot of goodies, and I'm trying to earn trophies now because, well, yeah. The fact that you can reset and reassign your ability points at any time using the bargain priced 345 gold Tacticians Renewal is what hurts the difficulty of this game. If you should encounter a legendary ass beating, simply reassign skills accordingly and repeat. Your enemies honestly have no chance with such godlike strategy. And let me just say, formally, that if you use any exploits and cheats in this game, you truly suck at RPGs. Seriously. Go back to mommy's womb if this game is just too tough for you.

My biggest gripe is petty, but in all honesty a major irritant, like meat stuck in teeth. WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU MAKE THE X BUTTON PERFORM TWO FUNCTIONS SUCH AS JUMP AND PICK UP LOOT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Oh look, there's loot to pick up...JUMP...JUMP...finally picks up loot. Oh look, there's weed and rocks to harvest...JUMP...JUMP. Seriously? I know what you're probably thinking...just remap the controls...sorry there padre, we peons on the consoles can't map the controls out beautifully so we can make a LOGICAL switch separating the functions of the X button. Who the hell thought up this crap? I walk through the Exalted Plains killing ten billion corpses who drop mad loot and I end up looking like an anorexic super Mario with all the damn jumping. Stick to the past Bioware and get rid of the stupid jump command...especially since a person wearing steel armor really wouldn't get that far off the bloody ground unless they stuck a rocket up their ass.

Thank you Bioware for including 10 high dragons to slay. They present an interesting challenge until you use the Knight Enchanter who kills all of them with relative ease. Seriously, that spirit blade is BOSS. Nothing can stand in its way!

I've actually read somewhere that people aren't choosing Vivienne in their party because she's black. Um, no, she's a bitch, that's why she gets left on the bench all the time. And I don't care what people say, Sera is hilarious, and with Iron Bull in the party it's even funnier. However, I personally admit that having Vivienne verbally spar with Solas and Dorian is also pretty good. LOVING that banter. As for my first ending of the game Vivienne ended up becoming the next Divine, which is incredibly lame. First of all, Leliana should just kill her. Second of all, she's a mage who wanted to restore the Circle, so send her ass to that big nunnery and be done with it. Third, seriously, WTF? I guess I didn't push Leliana or Cassandra hard enough to be the Divine. And Solas? What a twist, huh? I'm being sarcastic here as it is constantly alluded to throughout the story that he had a much larger role to play in the whole story. So that wasn't as much of a shock as Morrigan actually being a more pleasant character to be around. And Corypheus is by far the lamest big bad ever. Very underwhelming as an ""ultimate"" evil sort of villain. Please don't tease an Archdemon...bring it forth and let's have at it.

I can't help but think that someone in charge of Sonic Team at SEGA is one heck of a masochist.  It's almost like they find pleasure in finding ways to torture us by giving us a taste of what we want, and then pulling it away right when we're beginning to enjoy it.

Case in point: the Werehog.  There's nothing inherently wrong with the Werehog mechanic, and it certainly has its fun moments.  Button mashing beat-em-ups are fun, but they're also not Sonic.  Fans like me sound like broken records when we say that Sonic is all about speed, and the fact is that's not true.  Even the very first Sonic game had levels where platforming and puzzle-solving were more important than speed (Marble Zone and Labyrinth Zone).  The difference was that in these examples, the platforming was seamlessly mixed with the other stuff.  Not here.  With Sonic Unleashed, you really feel as if it's two completely different games, neither of which has the depth to keep the momentum going as far as it could, and SHOULD.

The daytime Sonic levels are probably the best 3-D Sonic levels ever created.  But they're also only about 30% of the total game, while the Werehog section takes up the other 70%.  I hope that if a sequel is ever made for this that they get the proportion more equal, or find a way to make the Werehog sections faster and more interesting.

Sonic Team is getting closer to a good 3-D sonic game.  However, after so many missteps, I don't know if closer is good enough.  Perhaps it's time to take Sonic the Hedgehog away from this floundering team of programmers and give it a life with someone new.  If Sonic Team has so little faith in its trademark that it thinks it always needs a new gimmick beyond simple speed and platforming (the next Sonic game due next year?  Sonic and the Black Knight.  Why does Sonic need a SWORD?), then they should either stop making Sonic games or give the license to a new team who will do for Sonic what Miyamoto has been able to continually do with Mario.","Wherefore art thou, Werehog?",1227225600,4,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The game itself is about a Card Master named Rooks, the last of his kind, charged with having to save the world...basically. Pretty common theme back in the SNES JRPG days and this was no different. You will find and lose companions throughout your journey. You will collect loot from treasure chests, purchase new gear at shops, or even pick up some special cards to give you a special attack to use during battle.

The star of this title is the music and really, its an odd thing that brings me back. I remember the music and think, ""That is such a fun game.""
The reality, I have a great time playing it, but like most old school RPGs, the fighting gets VERY repetitive. It gets grindy also at times, though, I have played it a few different ways and you don't HAVE to, but if you want some decent gear, you do since most of the best items are found in town.

With the game separating itself  into chapters and different towns, the farther you progress, the more varied the purchases become in town and logically, the more powerful you become.

At the end of the day, it is a fun piece of gaming history and I for one will end up coming back. It is not the greatest RPG of all time - not even close.

4.0,True,"04 11, 2012",A18YFCLL3GBD0T,B005OTVI9Y,Tara T.,"I got Train Simulator 2012 because one, I've always liked trains (had model trains when I was a youngster) and, two, I wanted a peaceful game to counter-balance the normally violent FPSs and RPGs I play. I'm happy to report I got both. Yes, the game requires a constant internet connection and Steam. However, there are advantages to Steam like automatic updates, quick access to mods, DLCs, etc.

Train Simulator was a little confusing in the beginning, though there is a tutorial, it took me a bit to figure out the track switching required to unload and load freight cars and guide your train onto the proper tracks. There were also new terms to learn like ""siding"" (side tracks were stationary freight cars sit) and ""rake"" (a group of connected freight cars) which I found fascinating. Once I got through the tutorials, I was happily uncoupling and coupling freight cars and delivering them to their destinations. It was also interesting to learn how to operate locomotives. Though Train Simulator 2012 has simple controls for the novice, I soon switched to expert mode that has the same controls as real engines. I learned that these controls need to be fine tuned to navigate your trains up and down hills, and in yards, and trains don't stop on a dime! Especially one that's hauling a bunch of cement cars!

You can switch to an interior view of the locomotive and operate the real life controls inside the cabin or listen to messages on your CB radio, though they do repeat and are the same regardless of which train you choose (one of the first mods I'm going to look for is an expansion for the CB banter). There are several other exterior views including ""helicopter"" (from above) and bypass, where you watch your train from a view of someone standing on the side of the tracks. There is a plethora of different routes from various locations in the US and Europe, where you can choose to pickup passengers or freight, or you can choose a specific engine to drive whether steam, electric, even old coal burners!

It's obvious great care was taken when rendering the trains and they are a joy to look at, though the landscape suffers graphically. Switching to free camera and roaming around reveals blocky graphics or grazing cows frozen in one position, though there are vehicles traversing the roads and highways, no people are seen except when loading and unloading passengers. But this is a minor complaint compared to the realism of the trains themselves.",A (usually) relaxing alternative to action games,1334102400,6,,

4.0,False,"07 5, 2011",A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00432O50W,Elias,"Goichi Suda is one of my favorite developers in the game industry today. He and his Grasshopper Manufacture company have crafted some of the most unique and entertaining games of the past decade, such as the excellent ""No More Heroes"", ""Killer 7"", and the intentionally flawed ""Flower Sun and Rain"". Shinji Mikami's resume is no less impressive, creating and producing such genre-defining (if not genre-creating) games as ""Resident Evil"", ""Resident Evil 4,"" and ""Devil May Cry."" Akira Yamaoka, while not a developer, is often considered to be one of the greatest composers in gaming, scoring the music for every ""Silent Hill"" game with the help of vocalist Mary-Elizabeth Mcglynn. ""Shadows of the Damned"" is what happens when all of these people unleash their unbridled creativity, and the result is as gloriously messy as you'd expect.

Hot-blooded, Hispanic demon hunter Garcia Hotspur is pushed over the edge when his ""angel"", Paula, is kidnapped by Fleming, the lord of all demons. With the assistance of his talking skull/gun/torch/motorcycle companion, Johnson, Garcia sets out with the intention of saving Paula, killing Fleming, and creating their own ""road movie"". The plot doesn't thicken much from there, but boy, does it ever keep you entertained; expect many cracks about the size of Hotspur's ""Johnson"" and dialogue that repeatedly breaks the fourth wall.

The type of immature humor would be irritating in anybody else's hands, but the saving grace is that Suda 51 knows how to nail this style of dialogue without getting annoying with it. It also helps that Shinji Mikami had a clear impact on the gameplay, which feels like a more fine-tuned version of ""Resident Evil 4""'s over-the-shoulder shooter vibe which so many others have tried to imitate. With well-written jokes flying at you at a rapid pace in the middle of the game's intense action, it feels like the video game equivalent of having the perfect sandwich; these ingredients would be pretty good by themselves, but together they're freaking heavenly.

Unlike those two things, though, Yamaoka's score would need no companions. It stands on it's own as a fantastically eerie and exhilarating piece of work, dipping into his own ""Silent Hill"" sound while also pulling off rock, salsa, and just about anything else you can think of. Players may find themselves standing still for a few moments just hear the tracks in more detail. His tracks with Mary-Elizabeth Mcglynn are also wonderful, and hearken back to their earlier work on ""Silent Hill 3"".

But like any Suda51 game, ""Shadows"" isn't devoid of flaws. There are an irritating amount of technical hiccups which both frustrated and confused me, including but not limited to: hit-or-miss graphics, disconcerting amount of pop-up textures, lagging in menus, and occasional inability to spawn checkpoints, making it impossible to proceed without restarting the level. Also irritating is the lack of replayability due to the inability to start a new game with your fully upgraded weapons. These aren't the only issues, but certainly the most noticeable to me. These things, and more, are what kept me from giving this game a perfect score. It seems like the developers were too focused on the player having fun than being impressed with the technical aspects of their product.

That would be an issue if they were trying to do anything else, but it's hard to fault one for wanting you have unadulterated fun, especially in the field of video games. With increasingly repetitive games such as ""Call of Duty"" flooding the market that take themselves so seriously, it's a relief that games with a great sense of what it means to have fun are making a comeback with ""Shadows of the Damned"" and ""Duke Nukem Forever."" While those games aren't anywhere near comparable on an aesthetic or gameplay level, their goal to give gamers a brainless good time are almost one and the same.

And that goal is what keeps me from picking on ""Shadows of the Damned""'s tech issues, much like I was able to look past ""Forever""'s lack of graphical horsepower. Grasshopper, Mikami and Yamaoka aimed for the player to laugh, to feel like badass, and to experience something that is truly memorable. With such a noble goal, and with such originality imbued in the experience itself, one would have to be pretty self-important to pass up one of the most fun games of the year.

I am not a huge fighting game fan since they tend to get old fast.  You play through a couple times and then it collects dust.  The single player mode is pretty much that.  Kombo Challenge (which is really only fun and useful to pick up some new moves), Arcade which is isn't packing anything new, and Story Mode which, while fun, is rather short and after one time through on each side, is spent.  The Freefall and Freeform Kombat modes are quite possibly the best tweak I have seen made to this franchise and is really a fun, over-the-top addition to any battle.  The chance to fight as The Joker though, was the selling point for me.  Midway did not disappoint.  The ""super-powerless"" characters are no pushovers and the moves of all characters are VERY true to their comic book persona.  Combine that with 1080 graphics and awesome sound, you have a well made game that just can't overcome the flaws so many fighting games have...........the replayability of the game on your own, but one that with friends(online and same-console) will keep the blood flying for hours.

Online is fun, albeit challenging at times.  The biggest gripe I had was the times I played online seemed to lag quite a bit.  I would be fighting and then suddenly four of their moves would show up at once.  I also had a fight stopped when I wound up in a wall with no way out.

The same console multiplay is where I have worn this game out.  I love playing against my friends at home on the same deck and this game delivers fun, fluid, and frantic battles.  I have even found myself getting creative with some home-made combos.  Make a note.......I have NEVER enjoyed a fighting game so much as to experiment with my own combos.  For me, this has made MK v DC worth the price of admission.

All in all a VERY solid game.  I'd like to see some DLC in the form of alternate costumes, additional characters, arenas, or game modes to keep it fresh.  While the roster is not small, it does seem to need a little something extra after playing hundreds of multiplayer battles.  Perhaps a four-player tag fight?

In short, if you got some friends you want to go head to head with, this game is a satisfying 4 stars and will do the trick for any MK fan.

4.0,False,"12 6, 2003",A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B00008Z0HX,--,"First person shooters are a dime a dozen, and more often than not any one plays much like another. Games in this genre are only rarely groundbreaking. ""XIII"" does not buck this trend, but it does provide a visual style that is undeniably unique. The game, which is based on a popular French comic book, wisely decides to embrace its origins. From the cel-shaded visuals to the comic-like cinematics, ""XIII"" definitely differentiates itself in the visual department. In the realm of gameplay, however, it's rather standard fare.
You step into the boots of number XIII, an amnesiac who washes up half-dead on a beach. From there, it's up to you to piece the plot together as you work your way through the game. Because it's a conspiracy theory, it gradually becomes more and more clear what is supposedly going on around you, and of course there are some twists on what you initially perceive. Even so, the story is a little thin, and it's ultimately pretty disappointing. The presentation, on the other hand, is remarkable in some ways. For instance, you will occasionally experience interactive flashbacks. These black-and-white storytelling segments are seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, and really pack a nice cinematic punch. The cel-shaded graphics, speech bubbles, and picture-in-picture windows certainly add the right comic book flavor to the proceedings, but the game's irritating soundtrack and sloppy voice work do hamper the overall presentation. Yes, David Duchovny is on hand to voice XIII, but the character has so little to say that the actor is painfully underused. The rest of the game's acting is too over-the-top, even when the style of the game is considered.
One thing ""XIII"" has is style. The graphical approach of the game truly sets it apart, and despite some minor problems you won't find yourself mistaking it for anything else on the market. It's a slick design, though I think at times the level engineers and texture artists used the cel-shaded graphics to promote a touch of laziness. Even when the visuals are at their worst, though, you will never feel ripped from the comic-inspired universe, which is superbly consistent.
The game generally relies on a shoot-anything-that-moves philosophy, and the action is decent enough. It's nothing to write home about per se, but it works. Strangely, the game's best weapons aren't available save in a few select levels (most of which rely on a more stealthy approach). The sniper crossbow is hugely gratifying, and well-placed throwing knives can elicit some glee as well. A harpoon gun makes a cool appearance in just ONE of the game's levels, and the rest of your arsenal is entirely unremarkable. Cue the usual suspects: pistol, uzi (called a ""minigun"" here, for some reason), rocket launcher, shotgun, et cetera, et cetera. These more conventional weapons provide unsurprisingly conventional action, and don't quite pack the punch that they should. It's easy to shoot an enemy in the head several times before he drops to the ground and dies.
In terms of level design, ""XIII"" is far from brilliant. The very linearity of the levels can be distressing at times, and often you'll feel like you're playing a ""rail shooter"" simply because you're being shoved by the game's designers in one given direction without any opportunity to stray or any incentive to explore. On the plus side, it's very straightforward, so you'll never get lost or reach an impasse. Outdoor levels are probably the coolest in ""XIII,"" and pack the strongest visual punch. Indoor locales are clich&eacute;d and considerably less impressive. Note to game designers working on a first person shooter: hold the factory levels filled with wooden crates, as we gamers do not want them! Thanks.

""XIII"" employs a practically unforgivable save game system. Though it appears as though you can save your game at any given time (as we PC gamers expect), it's nothing but an illusion. Loading said saved games takes you right back to the beginning of the level, no matter where you last saved. Worse, the game has no autosave feature, which might spell trouble for less paranoid first person shootists. These faults make ""XIII"" needlessly frustrating at times - particularly in stealth missions, which will ultimately require some trial and error since you can't experiment freely without risk of dying, getting caught, and ultimately starting the level from the beginning. I assume this problem stems from the game's multi-platform release, but it's just unacceptable.
""XIII"" is not a long game either, and experienced gamers will probably breeze through it. Given the game's linear nature, there's little replay value to be had. Despite some serious flaws, though, ""XIII"" is a good game, atmospheric enough that, cosmetically at least, it stands out from the pack. It might be wise to let it go down in price a little before picking up a copy, but most shooter fans will find something to enjoy here provided they don't enter into the experience with inflated expectations.

Elite Beat Agents and the two Japanese games Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! and its sequel are a lot of fun to me. This game combines the story-based action of the aforementioned series and adds a Professor Layton-like mystery on top. Overall, this works well, and the story and humor are fun and make me want to keep playing.

What isn't fun about the game is the sparsity of save points. I find myself having to play through six or seven rhythm games just to he to a save point so I can play another game, and frankly, that's annoying. I'd like to be able to save and pick up from any point, but it seems to get worse the more I play. Don't expect to be able to play for five or ten minutes, like on a short car ride; you'll have to pause the game and make sure your battery doesn't die in the meantime. Expect to play for 30 solid minutes to an hour, maybe more. Also, the difficulty curve is not so much a curve as it is a sine wave; the game will throw in five-star puzzles that sometimes seem just plain unfair, then give you a couple easy ones just to keep you going. The on-screen hints as to what you're supposed to be doing song always make sense, and sometimes it is very difficult to get in the groove, because your idea of the groove and the game's idea are completely different: ""ok, I hear the bassline and drums, so I'll probably be...aww, crap, I failed it! Argh!"" Thankfully, one doesn't have to get a perfect score to keep the story going; as long as you stumbled through well enough not to completely fail, and I'm glad for that--every time I had to hit Retry, it was for a session that I thought was just unfair.

Frankly, this is the best PvP game I've seen in years.  If you are looking for a good PvP game, just buy this now.  If you want a fun game to play alone and sail ships around the map by yourself, get Sea Dogs instead.  Not that this game can't be fun solo, but the meat and potatoes comes from fleet vs fleet action and you're not going to be a fleet of 1.  Join up, bring some friends / find some friends and you'll have a blast.

I'll stand by my 4-star rating as opposed to 5-star because frankly the first 10 levels are a bore and the avatar combat (swashbuckling) needs serious technical work before it will be any good, but the ship-to-ship combat is great fun and makes for the best player vs player action you can get today in an MMO, and I've played everything from UO to EVE to WW2O to Planetside to WOW and a bunch in between.

Also, don't think, ""Meh, I'd be joining it too long after release.  I don't want to have to grind XP in the newbie zones before I can have fun.""  This game isn't like that.  At level 43 I have no problem inviting level 7 guildmates to my groups, both for PvP and PvE.  They get a lot of XP by helping me sink level 40 opponents, I don't lose that much XP per ship and they're actually quite helpful, allowing me to kill faster and ultimately level faster and safer myself.  Even a level 7 in a small ship can damage sails, distract the enemy and, if ignored, do some nasty stuff like sailing up to rake the enemy decks with grapeshot.  A level 7 isn't going to take down a level 40 player in PvP but he's far from useless in battle.

There are 4 factions: Pirate, English, French and Spanish.  They are involved in a 4-way war for control of the Caribbean.  The game may be called ""Pirates of the Burning Sea"" but more accurate might be ""International War in the Caribbean (Also Has Pirates)"".  The three major nations are all worth playing and actually have some completely different game mechanics than the pirates, so if you wanted to be a pirate OR if you wanted to be a British fleet officer facing pirates, this game is for you.

The game basically has 3 distinct sections:

* Open Sea
In the open sea, you basically have a toy ship which you drive around over the ocean between ports and look for other ships to attack.  This is a simple but nice looking part of the game for navigating on the open sea without actually taking 4 real-time months to get places.

* Sea Combat
This is the real meat and potatoes for this game and I think they've done well with it.  It's not a total ""sea battle simulator"" as Sea Dogs was.  You don't have to manually aim your guns or time your firing with the sea swells, but you do have to deal with wind direction as well as managing your sails, maneuvering to keep targets within the general firing arc of your guns, the type of ammo you want to use (cannon balls vs armor, chains vs sails, grape vs crew, etc) and bleeding ship speed during hard turns.  There are various skills and expendable items you can use during combat to help repair emergency damage to sails, hull, etc.  There are also skills for increasing ship speed or weapon reload time at the expense of something else.  You'll have plenty of things to manage without worrying about the sea swells.

Ramming works -- although it does no damage, you can block an enemy ship, force him to turn by ramming him and generally set him up to be boarded.  You can also protect an ally by getting between him and whoever is shooting at him.  Really, this is some impressive ship to ship combat.  If you played EVE, I can tell you that POTBS ship combat is better than EVE ship combat.

* On foot
There is a ""you"" in this game.  You aren't just a ship.  You can dock with ports and run around but there's also a melee component to the game.

Hand to hand battles come into play during some missions given to you by the NPCs but it's also part of ship to ship boarding.  If you pull alongside an enemy ship, you can attempt to board it and fight the enemy captain and NPC crew using your character and your own NPC crew.

This part of the game is not overly well fleshed out.  You will be disappointed if you come expecting a full blown World of Warcraft type battle experience.  It's more like a fun little meta-game they threw in, and it's not bad.  It reminds me a lot of combat in City of Heroes, actually.

Back to ports, though -- ports are where you'll find another large aspect of the game: crafting.  I was surprised with the depth and thought they've put into crafting, but I suppose it makes sense.  What good is a ship if you don't have something to carry?  Because what good is being a pirate if other people aren't carrying things you can steal from them?  So even if you're a full blown PvP pirate, you have to appreciate the crafting game simply because it gives you something to take from other people.  (Arrr, booty.)

To get started with crafting, you go to a port and create a Warehouse.  Once you have a warehouse you can create resource structures depending on what resources are available at the port.  If there's ""Fertile Soil"" you can grow crops (such a hemp, used in making rope, or maize, used in making cheese or growing livestock).  If there's ""Oak"", you can set up a lumber yard for farming oak.  Etc.  These farms supply resources based on a real-time clock.  So the person who plays 16 hours a day is not able to bring in more resources from a farm than someone who plays 1 hour a day because the farm is basically working 24 hours a day whether you're there or not.  You just need to swing by periodically and collect your resources.

From this, you have the basis for an overwhelmingly player-driven economy.  From the start, the game encourages you to use the auction house to look for player-made goods rather than the NPC store, which sells only very basic things and sells them at much higher prices than players are likely to charge for the same things.  Don't buy your ammo from the NPC ""Fence"" until you've checked the Auction House for player-made ammo which is cheaper.

4.0,False,"12 22, 2011",A1UH8M9QALD2LS,B002AB7TX8,MS,"STORY-

The awakening of an ancient being known as the Old One has caused a colorless fog to sweep over the world. Wherever the fog goes, death and demons follow in its wake.
Many heroes attempted to stem the growing tide of monsters and stop the Old One, but none have been successful...
Your character (a person whom you design and name before starting the game) is the last hope of the kingdom of Boletaria; a warrior who has come to defeat the rampaging demons and hopefully lull the Old One back to sleep.
At first glance, the plot seems quite simple -- become incredibly powerful, save the universe from an ancient evil, etc. etc. However, Demon's Souls leaves enough to the imagination to make the story feel mysterious and atmospheric.

GAMEPLAY-

[general]

The game's central focus is in the Nexus, the place you return to whenever you exit a world. In the Nexus, there are no `enemies' per se, but you can buy, upgrade and store items there. Later on in the game, the Nexus will fill up as the player discovers new NPCs (many of which can teach you new skills and spells).
After beating the first true boss of the game, you are rewarded with five different Archstones that can transport you to different worlds; all fantastically unique and all with a number of different levels to complete.
Doesn't sound so hard yet, does it?
The catch is that whenever you die in one of these levels, you are sent straight back to the beginning. All of the enemies respawn, and whatever items you consumed were wasted in the process. Better still, dying in `body form' causes you to lose your corporeal flesh and half of your life bar along with it. In offline mode, the only way to regain your body is to defeat a boss or use a special item.
Once you defeat the boss, however, you are rewarded with a checkpoint and a passage back to the Nexus.
Incidentally, Demon's Souls autosaves almost constantly, so it is virtually impossible to 'undo' mistakes unless you shut off the console right away (although this may also mess up your save file). Admittedly, it can be irritating to lose progress, souls and items due to a careless error, but part of the challenge of Demon's Souls is learning to accept mistakes and not be a sore loser by attempting to ragequit every time you die.

[regarding souls]

Whenever I play RPGs, I tend to accumulate absurd amounts of cash -- not because I grind a lot, but because I rarely ever use it. I get so paranoid that ""I might need it later"" to buy an expensive item that I end up not taking advantage of it at all.
Incidentally, the same thing happens with items themselves. I may be getting my face turned into ground hamburger by a boss, and I may happen to have a Scroll of Face-Melting Death in my inventory, but I'll NEVER use it. Why? Because ""I might need it later"", that's why.
Demon's Souls, however, gives a strong incentive to spend -- whenever you die, you drop all of the combined currency/experience points (known as `souls') in a bloodstain that marks the spot of your demise. The only way to regain them is to travel back to and touch the bloodstain. If you die before reaching your old bloodstain, a new one is created in its place and all of the souls contained in the original are lost.
There isn't any sort of storage system for souls -- you have to choose between keeping them or spending them right away. It can be extremely tempting to run back to the Nexus and spend all of the souls you gain during a level to avoid losing them, but leaving a level causes enemies to respawn and essentially negates your progress.
Needless to say, it's incredibly frustrating to have 50K+ souls vanish as a result of a careless death, so managing your resources and time well is a necessity.

[online play]

The online component of Demon's Souls is perhaps the best part of the game; I certainly enjoyed it. While there is no way to directly communicate with other players through voice or text chat, you can occasionally see their colorless phantoms wandering the level. Observing them can give you small hints by alerting you to the location of items, hidden passages or traps. The bloodstains of other recently deceased players can also be touched, showing what happened in the last few seconds of their life. This is both amusing and sometimes incredibly helpful: for instance, if you see a bloodstain right before you turn a corner, it's likely that an enemy is waiting just out of sight.

Players can also leave messages for their fellow masochists, alerting them to danger or giving them tips and strategies. There are several preset templates such as ""Don't go forward with ____."" or ""Beware of ____."" to choose from, along with other short phrases.  If a player finds a certain message useful or amusing, they can recommend it. Recommendations restore the health of the player who left the message, which encourages people to be helpful rather than deceptive.

If you want to be more directly involved with another player, you can enter their world as either a black or a blue phantom.
While you're in body form, you can summon up to two blue phantoms by touching their corresponding soul signs. Blue phantoms are there primarily to help you get through tough levels, and it's amazing how much easier certain parts of the game are while playing as a team. If you are successful in beating the boss of a level, the objective is met and the blue phantoms regain their body as well as some souls for their trouble.
A black phantom, on the other hand, invades the world of a player in body form with the intent of killing them. Enemies in another player's world take no notice of black phantoms, and the unfortunate victim cannot return to the Nexus until either he or the invader dies.
There are few things more terrifying than getting your body back and striding boldly into a new level only to see that you are being invaded. Although it can be frustrating to die at the hands of another player, it is also appropriately frightening and exhilarating to face off against them.

[difficulty]

There's no doubt about it, Demon's Souls can be genuinely difficult. It is likely that you will die, and then die some more, and continue to die as you play the game.
But the saving grace of Demon's Souls in this respect is that each death teaches you something -- the location of a trap or a fall, the attack pattern of an enemy, the type of terrain you are working with, etc.
Some may experience more frustration than others at their deaths, but what I love about this system is that everybody genuinely starts to become, well, smarter. Players who approach new enemies and areas with caution rather than carelessness are rewarded, whereas players who simply try to rush their work are severely punished.
In this sense, Demon's Souls is a generally fair game. Anybody (yes, anybody) can beat it, given enough dedication.
Of course, Demon's Souls can also get rather tedious or frustrating if a player is forced to start from the beginning of a level over and over again. It's certainly not a game for the faint of heart.

BATTLE SYSTEM-

Battles happen in real-time, allowing players to block and attack as they see fit. There are a wide variety of weapons to choose from, including axes, rapiers, bows, swords, spears, clubs and more. Each different type of weapon has different properties and different ranges. Much like every other aspect of the game, combat in Demon's Souls requires the player to think carefully and look for openings before attacking. Actions such as eating recovery items and using `strong' attacks have time delays on them, meaning that they leave you vulnerable.
The vast number of weapons, spells and attacks makes the combat in Demon's Souls deep and intuitive, which in turn makes the PvP aspect of the game a lot of fun.
Bosses are often huge and require a carefully planned strategy to defeat, and finally managing to kill one of them after dozens of deaths is incredibly satisfying.
The only real gripe I have with combat is the lock-on system, which sometimes feels a bit sticky and can make targeting specific enemies a hassle when there are a lot of them in the same area.

VISUALS, CHARACTERS, AUDIO AND WRITING-

Demon's Souls is a beautifully atmospheric game. Whether you're wandering in the tunnels of a deserted mine or traversing the precarious ledges of a mountain temple, you can bet that each area will look and feel distinctly different. The graphics deserve praise, but it is also worth mentioning that the levels are fairly dark and poorly-lit, which can sometimes detract from your ability to really appreciate the care that went into designing the levels.
The characters of Demon's Souls resemble set pieces more than they do actual people; they do little more besides provide you with context clues and sell you items/spells/miracles/stat bonuses. Nevertheless, the uniqueness and interesting design of the supporting cast kept them from being reduced to mere props, and I found myself caring about them despite their lack of expository background or personality development.
Demon's Souls has very little background music, a fact which some people may find unnerving or unappealing. Personally, I thought that it often tended to heighten the sense of solitude the player feels while exploring a level, and was appropriate for the theme of the game. To make up for the lack of music, the sound effects are spot-on and do an excellent job of setting the mood.
The writing is good, for what little of it there is. There are very few cutscenes, and most characters only offer a few lines of dialogue when spoken to. It didn't really bother me, but it did seem a little bit minimalist.

PROS/CONS-

+ challenging but rewarding gameplay
+ intuitive combat
+ good atmosphere and writing
+ interesting characters
+ excellent graphics
+ online play is fun

- repeating levels can get tedious
- not much interaction with other characters
- cryptic story

After playing it for a few hours, I must say that it's extremely fun but it is somewhat difficult to pick up and play.  Some of the moves aren't properly explained and the advanced moves are way too difficult to perform, especially if you're limited in space like me (Kinect sensor from my area of play is a maximum of 7 1/2 feet away).

Overall, I would still recommend this game because it features good music, it makes your active, and I felt that my handling skills have improved, especially my off hand(left).

4.0,False,"07 26, 2014",A2582KMXLK2P06,B00081RQ08,Bryan,"While it's true Faxanadu is a pretty good underrated NES game, some of the things about the game still amaze me in today's world concerning how far the action/adventure RPG genre has advanced since this game's release in 1988.  For one the dialogue when talking with the townspeople seems to be rather intelligent for its age often providing hints and telling the story of elves, dwarfs and meteorites which explains the unusual variety of enemies you encounter throughout the lands such as tentacle-shaped jellyfish like creatures and more folklore stuff such as fireball spitting dragons.  It's unique to combine the two.  Often times enemies jump back and forth over your head which is strange and simply means you can walk to the left or right and stab to defeat them.  Enemy movements are usually simple and aren't much trouble.  If you take your time, you can take a decent amount of hits before your life's in danger anyway.  This is all done in side scroller action.

Though I'm in the minority with this next comment, I find the difficulty on the easy side and here's why- the game is built around a system where enemies drop gold rather frequently after you defeat them, and this gold is used to buy important items and weapons in town such as life-filling red potions and longer swords that *dramatically* make the adventure more manageable.  This means in order to guarantee success, you can grind for enemies by simply leaving the screen/coming back over and over endlessly, ultimately assuring an easier time navigating the lands.

The places noteworthy of exploration are honestly really tiny but loaded with enough enemies that you won't really care.  I guess I'm still stuck in the childhood mentality and went into Faxanadu assuming the world would be humongous like it used to be from the eyes of a 10-year old kid who first noticed this game in the early 90's.  Of course the game's smaller now than it once looked.  Still however, it's lengthy enough to keep you entertained for several hours.  You can't really blow through a game like this anyway since the emphasis is on carefully exploring and finding items while constantly battling danger.  You certainly don't have to worry about Faxanadu being cheap and causing lots of deaths.  Not really.  This game is really fair for the most part as far as that goes.  I can think of a few enemy locations however that are a bit tricky to work your way around.  Only a few.

I love the occasional silly dialogue even though it's intended to be well-meaning and part of the adventure such as ""Don't try too hard"".  Good advice for MANY NES games right there!  The funniest one is ""I've used key"" since there's supposed to be an ""a"" between ""used ""and ""key"", haha.  Kind of pointlessly annoying how it even says you've used a key and other items throughout the game when the player probably already KNOWS that he used them.  Also strange how the characters blink rapidly/roll their eyes whenever they speak to you.  It makes you think they're mocking you or being sarcastic, but it's all unintentional.  Oh and maybe it's just me, but it seems like the more upfront/slightly intolerable themes are played frequently while the not so popular stuff doesn't last long enough.  This seems to be the case almost every single time.  The area with the mist comes to mind.  And how about the final dungeon music?  VERY creative, appealing and goofy at the same time.

The gameplay is 'fresh' but not 'new'.  When you play, you automatically feel like you've played something like it before.
The force powers are neat, but they are lacking too.  If you've played KOTOR, you'll be disappointed at how little picking different force powers affects how you play the game.  By that I mean you buy a sphere, and it doesn't really have a noticeable different on gameplay, throughout the game.  More like a subtle enhancement of your existing ability.

*SPOILER* The boss battles...  Horrid.  For some reason they made it so that pretty much whatever force power you gained that level, must be used to take out the boss at the end of that level for the first half of the game.  Later bosses are taken with similar technique, not giving you a choice as to how to dispatch them.

If you want headphones so you can listen to music, but also want the mic for gaming or Skype, then I'd pass on these, personally. Even tho the product description says ""well defined highs"", in actuality they are muffled, and cloudy. When I plugged these in to a headphone splitter, and listened to them next to better quality headphones, the difference was huge. (Tho maybe its unfair to pay less than twenty dollars for headphones, then expect them to sound like two hundred dollar headphones.) Earphones I've tested in this price range, offer much better highs, than this set. I was listening to a Rolling Stone's song, and wondered, ""What happened to the guitar solo?"" It was there, but barely to be heard.  Also, these are not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. There's no padding on the headrest, and the padding around the ears is a bit tight. After an hour or two, you're sure to have headphone fatigue, if you have a large skull.

ON the other hand, if you want gaming headphones, for playing video games, I think these would work great. In fact, if you're gaming for any length of time, the lack of high end would protect your hearing from nerve damage. If you are only listening to people talking, bottom heavy bomb explosions, or gun fire, these headphones will work fine. The mic flips down for on line chat with your gaming partners, or flips up and out of the way, when you need better vision of the screen. There's an ON/OFF switch, for the mic function, right next to the volume control.  I liked the volume control, in case you're getting sick of hearing that video music loop, or have one too many gun shots go off right in your ear.  Just turn it down for a second, while you concentrate on the game controls.  The mic and the headphones work with separate 1/8th inch jacks. Also, the design is simple, and contemporary.

4.0,True,"10 13, 2002",A1QWJROCKC4LFL,B000066RKC,Juan De La Cruz,"First off, I would say that The Thing is an above average linear game in the realm of the survival/horror genre of PS2 games.  The game's basic premise is taking on the role of the lead character that is given the undesirable task of investigating an artic research station that has been taken over by an alien entity which looks like a really nasty mix between swamp thing and last year's tuna casserole you forgot about in the back of the refrigerator.  The smaller manifestations of the Thing vary form looking like little skulls running around on chicken legs to goo spitting spiders.  Not exactly inspiration for staying up all night wandering what that sound was outside your window.  But, in the Thing's defense it certainly makes a nice target for spraying with your shotgun and then barbecuing it with the flamethrower.
The game's primary focus is on realistically bloody combat, with the arctic station as its backdrop.  The game does contain the basic elements of squad teamwork, but it comes across as more of an afterthought than anything else.  The redeeming element of the teamwork though is the concept of trust and fear in each of your teammates, as it gives them a feeling of having different personalities and temperaments; to the point where you might actually feel a bit sorry when you have to waste them upon their being infected by the Thing.  Which gives the basis for the NPC's fears; anyone can turn into the Thing at any time.  This is a really nice touch as the NPC teammates don't feel as static as they do on games like Project Eden.  You'll find though that as long as you have an extra piece on you, all you have to do is give it to a newfound teammate to get them to trust you.  This also introduces a very simple form of inventory management and conservation as you sometimes have to decide whether you should use that last med kit to heal your fellow teammate or save it for yourself.
The difficulty level is somewhere between low and medium.  I for my part would have liked to have had more encounters with boss characters and Thing manifestations that are harder to kill.  The few bosses present in the game are relatively easy to defeat once you recognize the pattern in which they're swinging their gigantic appendages in their mostly futile attempts to clobber you.  Another addition that would have upped the difficulty would have been harder puzzle solving, as the puzzles essentially comprise fetching keys to open locked doors and finding engineers to fix certain power panels that you the character cannot fix yourself.
In my own humble opinion the graphics for this game are top-notch and maintain a pretty even frame rate throughout the game, even when you've got a whole room of little Things leaping at you.  The flame effects for the fires and flamethrower discharges are very nice.  About the only complaint that can be leveled against the graphics is that the collision detection can be a little off, hence being able to stick your hands in to the wall sometimes.
In conclusion, I reiterate that the game's focus is on the bursting into the room with both guns blazing style of action (though you will find areas where you'll have to pick off enemy commandos with your sniper rifle).  The game does provide some real challenges here and there, but for the most part it's pretty much a nice stroll through the blood stained halls of the arctic station.  Though this doesn't sound like much fun, this game somehow miraculously makes it fun.  So, if you're looking for a good action game to spend about five or six hours (depending on how good you are) on, The Thing is a pretty good bet.  If you want deep psychological themes which give you that nice creepy feeling and make you want to play it at night, your better off sticking with the Silent Hill series or Fatal Frame.",More action than horror,1034467200,2,,

However, if you enjoyed Mario Kart Wii this might be of interest. The two games are alike in many ways, but they play quite differently. For example, if you were frustrated by the over abundance of weapons in Mario Kart, that is not the case here. While the weapons are simliar in usuage, they are much more rare and not nearly as devestating. Winning a race is much more about knowing track layouts and skillfull drifting than pelting other racers with items. Especially with online matches, this is a definite plus.
  Yes, this game supports online matches, and despite a few missteps or oversights by SEGA they tend to be quite good, although finding a match might take awhile. To be fair, I purchased this game day one, so perhaps there simply weren't many players availible yet. BTW, friend codes are required to race specific people. Of course local multiplayer is always an option.
 Track variety is pretty good, featuring levels from Sonic, Jet Set Radio, House of the Dead, Samba de Amigo, Monkey Ball and Billy Hatcher, but given SEGA'S rich history, it feels kind of skimpy, especially considering the lack of Outrun or Virtua racer courses. Character variety is in the same boat, and while it is great to see Alex Kidd and Ulala, why no Gilius Thunderhead? Where is Toejam and Earl? How did Big the cat make the cut and not the cast of Streets of Rage?

4.0,False,"08 19, 2014",A3BMSRC38L9AKV,B00E8RVOFG,Particle Ghost,"Tales of Xillia 2 is the fourteenth title in the Tales series, officially serving as the sequel to Tales of Xillia, and is set one year after its events. The story revolves around orders to find the mystical Land of Canaan, but while boarding a train, it gets hijacked before its departure. Ludger Will Kresnik is out to save a certain someone, but the train crashes and the resulting medical treatment from Spirius Corporation puts Ludger in debt. Meanwhile, Jude, Milla and all the heroes from the previous game move on with their own lives, eventually crossing paths with Ludger and assisting with his quest. This time around, the story is more darker and more action packed, and can pretty well stand on its own two feet even if players have missed out on the original Xillia, but I'm not necessarily stating that it should be missed ether.

The basic battle system is the same as the original Xillia, but its an improvement on the real-time battle formula without changing the game. The enemies now also have weapon weaknesses instead of just magic weakness. The game keeps battles interesting by constantly switching up the compositions of the groups of enemies you encounter, as well as the games difficulty and A.I being much better this time around, and this goes for the enemies as well as your team. The normal difficulty setting in Xilllia 2 is harder than the hard setting in the original Xillia, and players can expect the unlockable ""Unknown Setting"" to be even harder. Other new improvements over the original is the new weakness system that makes it possible to combo bosses without them always countering. Xillia 2 does not uses the Lilium Orb as before. This time around, new moves and skills are learned by equipping extractors. The player starts off with only a few but there are many scattered throughout the course of the game. At first I didn't care for it however it starts to grow on you and becomes a well rounded feature. It is fast, convenient and simple, while offering a wide range of flexibility.

The shop leveling has also been removed in favor of a traditional shop and synthesis system, sort of like Vesperia featured. Linking is back and improved in various ways, and the linked AI is also better, with multiple combinations that allow for flexibility in your Artes setup. Not only this, but linking with characters will yield the benefits of their unique passive effects or active ones and can enhance battle opportunity. Unlike its predecessor, Xillia 2 adds Common and Unique Link Artes. Common Artes can be pulled off by using any particular Arte, while Unique Artes requires you to use a particular Arte that will trigger a special move that is exclusive to you and your linked partner. They have also added the side-step feature to the combat that was utilized in Graces f, giving the player an overall better feel of movement this time around.

In Tales terminology, Xillia 2 uses the ""Cross Double Raid Linear Motion Battle System"", a variant of its prequel's ""Double Raid Linear Motion Battle System"". It also features a new ""Weapon Shift"" system, similar to the Graces Shift system, with a new playable character, Ludger, able to shift between three weapons, such as the dual swords, dual guns, and a hammer. Speaking of new characters, Xillia 2 raises the bars by adding 3 new characters on top of the original 6, giving players an incredible roaster of 9. Ludger is differently the most powerful with an extremely varied assortment of Artes. He is able to interchange between his various weapons instantaneously, making even Ryu Hayabusa blush a little while watching from the sidelines. The only bad thing is Ludger is so powerful that he often feels omnipotent, causing the character roaster to feel entirely off balanced at times.

The remaining 2 new characters are Gaius and Musee, and they both add more melee and magic options to the game. The good news is that none of the new characters feel tacked on, and they all serve to add more diversity to the game. The length of the game is not that bad, it's not too short, and it's not too long. The game is split up into chapters and the main quest is around twenty hours, and with side missions, the player can double the games time easily. This also isn't considering the battle arena that can eat up some time as well. The audio of the game is on par with the previous titles in the series, but that can be widely speculative, as everyone has different taste. The graphics are around the same as the original Xillia, yet they do seem to have a little more polish this time around. The game still suffers from the occasional ""pop up textures"" but nothing game breaking. Most of the time the game runs very smoothly, but it can tend to lag some during the chaotic battles that have many enemies of screen at one time. It is also worth noting that each character does have unlockable costumes.

Now I will talk a little about the bad things. Xillia 2 is almost an exact carbon copy when it comes to the environments and monster designs, there is much that is unchanged from the original Xillia. To some, Xillia 2 could be hard to judge. Is it a stand-alone title or a sequel, or is it simply a cash grab title with not enough unique assets and resources and maybe it's better off being called an expansion. The truth is that depending on who you ask, they can all be true. In my opinion, it's a continuation that improved upon everything the original had to offer, with some recycling in order to shorten the development time and cut budget cost. The other complaint is that Ludger is the only character who is capable of changing weapons right away, and while this does improves the combat system greatly, it feels that if you play without him, your completely handicapping yourself. This doesn't mean the other characters can't handle they're own, it simply means that there is one character that feels drastically more powerful than the others, and you could find yourself using Ludgers blades 99% of the time.

Ludger is also a silent protagonist whose every word is chosen by you through a conversation trees. The problem is, that while some of these choices will lead to better relationships and extra cutscenes,  the majority of the choices seem pointless. Beyond the dialogue scenes, the only sounds Ludger makes are a series of screams and grunts, and in a game where everyone is voiced but the main character, it comes off as being very odd. The other thing that is very strange is the fact that your in debt with the Mob, and it could be considered the worst aspect regarding Xillia 2. Early in the game, you find yourself with an absurd $20 million debt that you must pay off over the course of the game. Whenever a certain amount of time has passed or you have made a certain amount of money, you must pay off a portion of your loan. After nearly every main story chapter, your mission goal becomes ""pay off the loan"", and an hour or two can be spent hunting quests and grinding for gold.

Depending on the players perception, this can be viewed as an attempt to pad the games length and it can easily double the time players spend with the campaign. If you grind a little as you travel along your journey and pick up a side mission here and there, it will help your funds add up much faster, but it does hinder players who attempt speed runs. The best way to deal with this matter is to take out the ""Giganto Monsters"" when available, they offer enough money to continue at a faster pace, but expect a well rounded fight. The player is also not required to pay off the entire 20 million in a single playthrough, you only need to pay around 1 million, any extra payments are optional and yield bonus items.

There is also no world map in the game, and it seems that Vesperia was the last in the series to deliver on this aspect. The game is somewhat linear, and at times some of the maps can tend to feel the same. I will however add that even though the game can seem linear, it is in no way lacking when it comes to content and open space. My Vesperia strategy guide is 254 pages, and Xillia 2 is 400 pages. The game is loaded with content, and at times it can even feel overwhelming. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, I am simply stating that you will definitely get your monies worth with the game. The towns they start you in are small and basic looking, as well as the open battle lands, but as you progress, the maps become huge and there are towns that are breathtaking.

There are other things this review could have covered, but it is mainly aimed for people that are very cognizant regarding the Tales series. For people new to the series, as far as the battle system is concerned, there are plenty of YouTube videos for people to watch in order to see if one finds it appealing, and I would highly recommend it. If I had to compare this title to any other game, I would compare the battle system and the world layout to Star Ocean: The Last Hope, except Xillia 2 is differently more complex. The combat system in Xillia 2 is insanely fun and in my opinion its the best in the entire Tales series. There are so many options and depth with each of the characters that the replay value is near endless. Many enemies also scale with the players level, so there is always a desire to learn the system, the challenge stays consistent, and the combat keeps expanding with complexity until the very end. At the right time, the player even receives an item that lets each character set up to 16 Artes at one time, and works like the ""Artes Ball"" in the PS3 version of Vesperia. There is also Mystic Artes, and once again, they come at the right time.

Xillia 2 like all games, definitely has its own set of flaws, but the pros greatly outway the cons. If they eradicated the mob debt, gave Ludger a voice, and gave the characters a better balance by having an equal amount of weapon swaps, I would easily rate it 5 stars. Even with these small quarrels, Xillia 2 is a fantastic game, as well as being a step up from its predecessor, with a very up to date combat system and a very cinematic story with a mature presentation. Sadly, JRPG's are becoming a dying breed, so it is imperative that they get the love they deserve so these localisations, as well as their creations, can continue to be brought to the masses. Hopefully the coming Tales of Zestiria can bring about the continuation of such quality, as well as whatever future the series may have in-store for us Tales fans to endure.",A Welcomed Addition For Such A Critiacly Underrated Franchise,1408406400,53,{'Style:': ' Standard Edition'},

If that sounds good to you, then you'll enjoy this game.

Story:  8/10
The Lord of the Underworld kidnaps the girlfriend of demon slayer, Garcia Hotspur (Yeah, that is his name) and drags her to hell.  Garcia and his floating skull buddy, Johnson, venture into hell to rescue Paula.  Johnson was a demon a long time ago, but now he has the ability to transform into different upgradeable phallic weapons and serves as Garcia's portable arsenal.  Garcia ventures through the treacherous levels of hell to try and save the woman he loves.  This ends up being pretty entertaining because hell is a really quirky place.  Eyeball chomping babies guard doors, braying goat heads light up levels, and some levels are actually giant naked women.

Gameplay:  8/10
This is a 3rd Person action adventure game with an over the shoulder camera.  The aiming is quite touchy, but you can adjust the camera and cursor speeds on the Options Menu.  I'd recommend slowing it down just a bit because it's tough to pull of head shots.  Garcia and run, dive roll, do a quick 180 turn, use an arsenal of weapons, and shoot light out of his Johnson.  In hell, darkness actually drains your health and makes demons invincible.  But one shot of Garcia's Johnson on a mounted goat head, and the room becomes illuminated.  The darkness clings to some enemies, making them invulnerable, but a blast of Johnson's light removes the darkness.  Once the demons are vulnerable, they can be attacked with a melee weapon, a pistol, a shotgun, a machine gun, or a grenade launcher.  Of course these have colorful names like Hot Boner or Big Boner...  because the guns shoot bones.  You can upgrade your weapons by finding Gems and there is a traveling merchant that appears in the game.  Here, you can cash in white gems for health potions (booze), ammo, or gun upgrades.

There are typical zombies and larger sub bosses that all take a bit of strategy to kill.  You may have to shoot them with light to expose a weak point, then attack the weak point as rapidly as possible to inflict the maximum amount of damage.  And there are some pretty large boss battles, which are pretty fun.

Levels:  7/10
The levels are hit or miss.  Throughout most of the game, you run through gore drenched towns and attack zombies, similar to recent Resident Evil games.  The difference here is the comedy.  Johnson and Garcia are pretty funny guys and they'll have you laughing from time to time.  So these levels are entertaining.  There are some levels similar to the old school 2D side scrolling shooters where Garcia looks like a paper doll and floats to the right and you have to shoot enemies.  These are pretty bad.  There is a bit of trial and error here and the bullets come from the tip of Garcia's gun, instead of the base.  This makes it impossible to shoot demons that get too close to him.  If a demon touches Garcia, he rapidly takes damage and will die in 2 seconds.  This is frustrating because demons jump out of the top, side, and bottom of the screen and if you get two on you, you are dead.

The checkpoints are also not in the best areas.  If you die at a boss, you'll respawn down a hallway and have to go through all of the unskippable cutscenes again.  This can get really annoying if you die a few times in the same spot.  I'm shocked that there are so few checkpoints at the beginning of the Boss Fights.

Graphics:  6/10
The game looks about 3 or 4 years old.  But it can get away with this because it's a parody of a B-Horror film which are notoriously low budget.

Sound:  9/10
The music is pretty cool and the voice acting is really entertaining.  Garcia and Johnson will keep you laughing.

Replay Value:  3/10
The replay value is limited.  There are 3 difficulty levels, but if you replay the game, you don't get to keep your weapons and the cutscenes are not skippable.  To make matters worse, you've heard all of the jokes already.

Maturity:  Adults
Gore, nudity, swearing, violence, demons, hell, torture...  No kid should play this.  It's an interactive gore drenched B-Horror Film with boobs and corpses... and occasionally corpses with boobs.

Overall:  7.5/10
This is a fun game that will take you about 8 hours to finish.  You will laugh if you like crude humor or quirky heroes.  You'll enjoy the game if you like the Resident Evil style shooters.  This game would have been much better if some of the gameplay mechanics were brought up to current standards.

This game has some of the best andmost realistic graphics out there. And the sound quality is amazing. With surround sound, it really sounds like you're in the middle of WWII. And the graphics are amazing, especially during the latter part ofthe game when you're playing as a Russian officer. Some of the scenes that you're involved in seem more cinematic and like something you'd expect from a cut scene than actual gameplay. By the final mission, the music and effects got me so pumped up that I was ready to go out and enlist.
That being said, actual gameplay isn't that great. If you're expecting a good First Person Shooter, I was a little dissapointed. The game pretty much amounts to the same thing over and over: finding enemies and shooting them. I noticed that there's a srategy guide available for this game. For the life of me, I don't know why, seeing as how there's no real strategy involved. The AI also isn't very well done. Every enemy can be shot easily if you simply use a sniper rifle and stay a little bit out of site. The aiming system and HUD isn't that great either.

Ion Storm was founded by John Romero and Tom Hall, the minds behind Doom.  Doom was, and probably still is,  the most widely known game in the FPS genre.  With its creators breaking off from ID software to form their own company, all eyes were already on Ion Storm from the very beginning.  The company had 2 branches: One in Austin, and one in Dallas.  The Dallas branch of Ion Storm spent years working on the game Daikatana.  Due to the amount of publicity the company and their game were receiving, Daikatana was highly anticipated by many gamers, who were champing at the bit to get their hands on what promised to be the best game ever made.  However, due in part to the excessively long development time (for the day), and the frustratingly wonky AI, Daikatana was finally released to painfully bad reviews all around.  The game ended up selling very poorly, and was directly responsible for the both the closing of the Dallas IS branch, and for the departure of Romero and Hall from the company.

Daikatana should have been the death of Ion Storm, and surely would have been if it hadn't been for what was happening in the Austin branch.  About the same time Daikatana was released, Ion Storm Austin completed work on and released a little known game called Deus Ex.  Deus Ex was a mix of FPS and RPG, which played like an interactive ""choose your own adventure"" sci-fi novel. Unlike Daikatana, Deus Ex was released to critical acclaim, and went on to sell very well.  It even won 2000s Game of the Year award.  Deus Ex singlehandedly saved the should-be-ruined Ion Storm from collapse.

Fast forward 3 years.  News of Deus Ex 2 comes.  Once again, in what can only be a cruel act of fate, Ion Storm was plagued with  a long development process, as well as the attention and anticipation of gamers everywhere.  You know where this is going, right?  The reviews on this site should deem it unnecessary for me to describe what happened when Invisible War was released.  I'll just say that it was universally panned, and die-hard fans of Deus Ex were, almost without exception, entirely disappointed with the game.  Shortly after DX2 was released, Ion Storm released another highly anticipated game, Thief III.  While not as critically panned as DX2, the game didn't sell very well, and was plagued with many of the same issues that DX2 apparently suffered from.

As a result, Eidos, Ion Storm's parent company, decided to close the doors at Ion Storm forever.

What should have been a return to greatness ended up being the end for one of the most ambitious and talented game development companies in the world.

Personally, I like DX2.  It's a bit smaller than the first game, and the story doesn't seem as inspired, but it's still a couple of steps above your average gaming fare.  There is a lot of freedom to enjoy yourself in this game, and,  like the first game, you can choose what type of person you will be.  You can chose to be a diplomat, a hardcore killer, or anything in between.  The only thing that I don't like about this game is the size of the play areas.  At times, the buildings are so tiny, you can't even move without bumping into something.  Other than that, the game is worthy of the Deus Ex name, in my opinion.  Even if it lacks something that the first game had, it is still worth checking out - ESPECIALLY at this price.",The game that killed the best game developer in North America.,1133395200,24,,

I remember using the hold style years ago, but as a gamer, I've gradually been expanding and upgrading my accessories to accommodate my style and needs.

I absolutely love the textured keys and the texture on the space bar. My Logitech G19s has a visual distinction for the keys but not the texture. For WASD this isn't entirely necessary, since you can still use F and J to get your positions in the correct position when typing, but I just love textured keys. But the STRAFE comes with two sets so the additional MOBA keys are going to be handy. I say going to be because MOBA's are not my genre, not yet anyway.

So what did I use STRAFE to play ARK, and for playing games, this is a very precise keyboard that works well, has a lot of custom programming available and, compared to G19s, considerably smaller. I plugged my G500 mouse into the keyboard, which worked well. This keyboard comes with two USB inserts so you can use that pass through port... very nice. Compared to the G19 which requires an actual plug in, for a tighter space or for a small footprint, the STRAFE is your keyboard.

The visuals, the lights, to me felt limited. Yes, you can screw around with patterns, and the software is pretty easy to use actually, to get your patterns going, create new ones (I didn't care for any of the defaults). I had no problems using my Media Keys.

Now a few down sides:

I had no idea how often I used my volume roller until I didn't have it. It's not a feature I cared about when I purchased my first for gamer keyboard and apparently it's become a requirement. Don't worry though, Corsair has other keyboard in this line that do offer the roller. I also really like having extra keys for my macros. Sure you can reprogram your keys easily with Corsair's software but my preference is to just leave the keys as is and just toy with Macro based keys instead. Now this can actually slow you down having to reach to keys that are outside the normal typing area. So this preference is not for everyone. Someone who likes a tight, small footprint keyboard with light options and programmable keys is going to love this keyboard. It's just not my style.

Now the real reason I switched back to my G19s... typing. I don't just game. I write a lot, a lot more than most people. I spend hours each night just writing. I hated typing on this keyboard. I loved it for gaming, and my minor gripes above would actually just prompt me to buy a  higher model with those options except... I just found how much I hated typing on this thing, typing as creative writing, not messages or chatting or e-mails but full sentences.

The gamer in me wants to try the Corsair K95, a more expensive but has all the features I am used to plus pick up the textured K70 kit Corsair offers to get some of those textured keys back. The writer in me remembers how awkward it felt to type on it... to the point where it distracted from my line of thought.

So in summary, as a gamer - loved the key responses, the textured keys, the ability to program any key and that it offers lights. I just missed some features that you can actually pick up with the more expensive models.

As a writer, not using it... didn't like the feel of typing for long periods of time at all.","Tight, Small Footprint Keyboard for Gamers.",1439596800,3,"{'Color:': ' Red', 'Style:': ' Keyboard'}",

Having played God of War, I wasn't expecting to find anything new in x-men origins; I was dead wrong. The basic combat in X-men origins is superior to every other God of War clone out there, and stands toe to toe with Krato's namesake. Wolverine can use his feral senses to track enemies in any enviornment, he can lunge over great distances and impale his enemies on his claws, or go berserk and shred everything in his path.

There are two different time periods present in this game. The first shows Wolverine when he was still working for the government. These sections take place in africa, and are an excellent balance of combat and enjoyable, if simple, puzzles. The other time period loosely follows the storyline to the far inferior movie. These segments are almost wall to wall action and they are a lot of fun. Alternating between time periods was a good descsion on the part of the developers. It keeps the gameplay from growing stale.

The graphics are more than servicable, the enviornments are colorful, and varied, and the voice acting is very good.

Another very strong aspect of this game are it's boss fights. While it is true that the bosses in the past are almost all copy-pasted, the boss fights in the movie story line are epic. From wiping the floor with the blob, to taming wild Wendigo's the battles are varied and plentiful.

My favorite feature in the game though, has to be the Wolverine on Wolverine fights. What are those you ask? There are Wolverine icons scattered throughout the game. When you collect both, you are able to unlock the outfit on the icon; but first you have to take it. You fight a mirror image of yourself, and once you when, not only do you get a new outfit, but you can fight your doppleganger again any time you want. You can even fight against a friend in this mode, which is just as cool.

When all is said and done, only the God of War himself stands in the way of this being the best game in it's genre. A definite buy.",Wolverine could totally take Kratos,1305763200,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
4.0,False,"07 5, 2012",A3VN0U04DY7MEA,B006ZPAY3M,MrFoxhound,"In this sequel to Lego Batman, players will not only get to take control of the Dynamic Duo, but a host of other DC characters, both good and evil, in the classic Lego gameplay that has spanned the entire series.

The very first thing that will most likely grab everyone's attention is that this time around the characters are fully voiced. Of course, the game has funny parts with acting just as the previous Lego games did through mimicry. The game opens up with Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne at a banquet, both nominated for the Man of the Year award. Bruce wins, but Joker is upset and crashes the party. Que Batman to enter. Lex and Joker end up teaming up in this game. No, Joker is not voiced by Mark Hamill, and Batman is not voiced by Kevin Conroy unfortunately. The voice actors are competent though and definitely don't detract from the game. The exception to that sentence is Superman. I don't know why, but they wanted him to sound like a campy, high school quarterback. It's noticeable, and annoying. His is the only bad voice acting, but he still manages to get a zinger or two in there, and offers up some funny parts. The set up for the game is that Lex and Joker work together so that Joker can use his skills to help Lex get elected President of the USA.

The graphics are your classic, blocky Lego fair here. You won't be impressed by any of the visuals and they'll look on par with previous Lego games. There is a real issue, however, with the cut scenes. These are compressed very poorly resulting in very poor visuals and even worse sound. The cut scenes are dark, grainy and very hard to hear.

The gameplay is going to be familiar to anyone who has played a Lego game or anyone who played the first Lego Batman. You and a partner need to traverse various environmental obstacles using suits and character abilities to proceed. Superman is an absolute blast to play as. His voice may be poor, but the first time I had Superman, it was great. You can fly, have heat vision, freeze breath and you're invulnerable. This isn't like other games where you play as Superman and a bullet hurts your health. No, you can stand there getting shot all day and not get hurt once. The only gripe I have as playing with Superman is that he doesn't feel as powerful as he should. Yes, he has the invulnerability thing going for him, but he also uses the same number of attacks to kill an enemy and there are parts where he can't destroy items that he should be able to, but Batman with the explosive suit can destroy. I realize that Lego makes these environments for Free Play, but it's still not cool to have to switch from Superman to Batman so Batman can use an explosive to destroy a box just because it's silver in color.

Superman's traits are really used in this game though. There are Heat Vision puzzles, and he can freeze water to make a climbable obstacle for his partner character. I would really like to see Superman get his own game. The flying in this game is basically hovering. I would have liked to see more open flying ability from the flying characters. It's nice though that if you let go of the flying button over a chasm or off a building the game won't kill your flying character, it'll just take control and reset you back on land.

This being a Lego game, you can bet that there is a TON of content in here, and it is an almost dizzying amount of content. There are 5 character boxes per level (minikits for the Lego faithful, instead of 10 per level, there are 5 and each one allows a character to be bought in the Lego Store), a special, Red Lego which allows for game changing abilities (2x/4x Stud Multipliers, Big Heads, etc.) and a song item that can be grabbed and bought allowing the player to listen to tracks from the game. There are also, by my rough count, around 50 characters to unlock, and most unlock at the 100k Studs or higher mark. I only had 330k Studs when I beat the game, and that was getting True Hero on every level, save the last (you'll understand when you get there), so unlocking all the characters is going to be a sick amount of grinding. Fans of the Lego series are used to this however.

Overall, Lego Batman is an average game. It doesn't stray far from the mold that other Lego games have set up, but the original story in this game and the voice acting, plus the massive amount of collectables means that you'll be playing this game for a very long time.","Lego Batman, now with more Superheroes.",1341446400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"09 15, 2009",ANQUC4ZM40ZU9,B001TD6SN0,Final Fleantasy 15,"I used to enjoy the old school fighting games like tekken 2 and mortal kombat 1-3. I'm also a huge...HUGE final fantasy fan. So this game really caught my attention. I didn't own a PSP yet so with the announcement of the Dissidia Bundle that came with a PSP 3000...I couldn't pass it up.

First the bad:

Story 1.5/5

Man was I disappointed. There is very little story here and what story does exist is very...very shallow. Like I said, I'm a huge fan of almost all final fantasies and the reason for that is because they have amazing stories (well...except for 12...it was trash). When I first heard about this game, I tried to not expect a whole lot. But when gamespot and IGN gave it really good reviews, my expectations rose quite a bit. Well, as far as the story goes, I was let down. Now on the other hand, this game is a quasi-fighting game. There really isn't any fighting games that have that much of a story. So in that aspect, this game has much more story than...say..soul calibur 4 did. However, the story is still very very shallow.

Now the not-so-bad not-so-good:

Characters 2.5/5

The characters were a wash. I thought they did a great job with the characters of FF 1-6. These characters haven't had a voice or a emotable personality before and this game did really well with them I think. I was a bit disappointed that they kind of made the warrior of light from FF 1 the leader because when you have BAMF's in your party like Cloud, Cecil, Terra, and Squall...it's kind of hard for me to believe they would listen to the WOL. I understand why they did it though so it's just a small complaint. Now the characters after FF VI, Cloud, Squall, and Tidus especially were poorly portrayed as far as I'm concerned. FF fans are much more familiar with these characters' personalities and they basically just summarized their personalities and emphasized their more obvious traits with very little else added. Cloud was just a depressed, non-confident guy that couldn't make up his mind...nothing special. Squall was just a jerk that didn't really have  a personality (yet in FFVIII he didn't really have a personality there either so maybe they did a good job on him) and Tidus' lines can be summed up as ""I hate my dad"" and ""Let's go have some fun."" The enemies were a wash too. Garland, the Emporer, Golbez, and Jecht were done very very well. Their stories really captured my interest. However, characters like Cloud of Darkness, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Exdeath were done very poorly. They could have done a lot with these characters but failed.

Now the good:

Graphics/Sound 4/5

These are some of the best graphics I've seen for the PSP. Granted, my PSP experience is rather limited but I haven't seen anything come close to this. My only real complaint about the graphics is that a lot of the cutscenes are..well..down right amusing. Why amusing? Because a lot of the time the character is speaking and his/her mouth isn't moving...or it is moving and nothing is coming out. So the english dubbing wasn't really done very well. The sound? Amazing. The remixes of the final fantasy songs are just amazing. I loved hearing new renditions of some of the great old songs.  The only thing that could have made it better was if they had made Chaos' music the ""Hell is Bad"" song off of the southpark movie sung by James Hetfield. Kidding. Voice acting? For the most part amazing. Some characters I thought could have been done a bit better (cloud, warrior of light) but for the most part, the voice acting was spot on.

Gameplay 5/5

Playing this game was really great. I played this game in order of the original 10 games which probably wasn't the best idea because the WOL from FF1 has one of the harder story lines. But this game has amazing replayability and the fighting is done really well. If I were to complain about something, I thought most of the summons were useless and the camera was really really bad at times. But these small flaws don't take much away from playing the game. There was a good mix of easy matches as well as dang near impossible matches.  The RPG elements were mixed in really well I thought. The gameplay of Dissidia really shines and can be very...very addictive.

All in all this game is worth a purchase. Definitely worth a rental if you are unsure. Some of the die-hard FF fans may not like it because IMO it does a bad job portraying some of the more beloved characters in the FF universe. You also need to go into this game realizing it's a FIGHTER with some RPG elements thrown in...not the other way around.  If you go in knowing the story is going to be a story in a fighting game, not an RPG, you probably won't mind the story that much. (After all, it pretty much kills any tekken, soul calibur, street fighter story out there) As long as you play it for what it is, you won't be dissappointed.",I give it a 3.5,1252972800,,,

4.0,False,"01 13, 2007",A2X8KN82L07RSK,B000G7PMXC,C. Johnson,"I like many of the reviewers of this game am very impressed.  This is a step up from Black Arrow on the XBOX, and from what I heard about Lockdown, Vegas blows it out of the water.  I have three shooters for the 360 and next to Gears of War this game is a close second.

The storyline is actually pretty good, like the title suggests you will spend most of your time in Las Vegas taking out tangos in casinos and lavish hotels.

The graphics in this game are done very well.  It looks like an XBOX 360 game is supposed to look, if you have an HD TV, that is even better.  It seems to me that every detail was taken care of down to the shadows cast on walls by your enemy and your teammates.  The detail of your weapons is also quite realistic.  You can actually tell the difference between each gun even down the camouflage design on one of the sniper rifles.  The environments are also done very well, down the tiny detail of bits of tumble weed blowing across your path in the train yard.

Sound also gets two thumbs up.  You will really appreciate the sound if you have the optional optical audio cable for the 360 that allows you to connect your 360 to your A/V receiver via the optical input.  Crank the volume up, and you will feel as if you are there.  Nothing but crisp sound all around, if someone is talking to you and he is behind you, it will sound like he is behind you; spin around while he is talking to you and the sound moves from speaker to speaker accordingly.  If you don't have an A/V receiver, no worries, the sound effects in this game are still very good.  Guns sound very convincing and like they are supposed to.  In addition to this, sniper rifles actually sound powerful, and not that puny sound from Black Arrow.

The game play is very fun for the most part.  The game can be quite challenging at parts, but the great placement of buttons on the XBOX controller, make controlling your character very simple.  Another thing I like about this game that wasn't in past Rainbow Six games is the ability to really cover.  In past games you may recall that ""covering"" just meant standing behind a wall and if you wanted to shoot at someone you had to leave cover completely to do so.  Not anymore, in Vegas your character can now take cover and fire at enemies without exposing your entire body to danger, this is definitely needed in this game because your enemies are a lot smarter and you WILL get killed frequently if you don't take advantage of this new feature.  You can even blind fire to keep your enemies at bay while not giving up any of your body (except for maybe your arm).

For some reason you only have 2 other teammates in R6:Vegas instead of 3, I don't know what is up with that but oh well.  Your teammates are smartER than on Black Arrow.  Notice I said smart-ER.  They pretty much follow your directions, but sometimes they go into stupid mode still and when you tell them to move or regroup with you, they will continue to fire at the enemy and eventually get killed.  They no longer flash bang or frag themselves with their own grenades anymore as they did on the XBOX versions of the R6 games.  In addition to this, if they go down in the field, you can actually heal them or tell your other teammate to do so.  In fact, you HAVE to save them, because if you don't, they will eventually DIE for real and your mission is over.  This adds a great aspect to the game, but what I don't understand is if you go down, why can't they heal you instead of the mission being over completely?

Now for the main thing I HATE about this game;  UBISoft's idea of having a checkpoint system in the game instead of or in addition to user initiated saves.  This is the ONE thing that makes this game so frustrating especially on Realistic difficulty.  I like a challenge and my first time through the game, I was challenged pretty well, but what I didn't like is having to repeat things I already did over and over and over and over again just because I didn't reach the next checkpoint before I got killed.  This is not my idea of fun, after the 3rd or 4th time spending 20 or more of going through the same stuff again, it starts to get old, boring and downright frustrating.  I had a little issue with this my first time through on Normal difficulty, but then after beating the game on Normal I went back and tried my hands at Realistic and while I loved the extra challenge, the current checkpoint save system really showed how flawed it is.  Realistic difficulty is way too difficult to only have this type of save system.  Sure it's beatable and I do like the challenge of Realistic difficulty, but the frustration of having to do things you spent so much time doing the same thing 5 and 6 times makes me not want to play anymore, especially since I already beat the gam anyway.  Games are supposed to be fun, which is why they are called ""Games"".  Apparently UBISoft thinks it is an absolute blast to force the players to play the same part of a level over and over and over and over again.  Call of Duty 3 suffered from this same flaw which is why I probably won't play it again after beating it the first time.  As I said with COD3 if they are only going to have a checkpoint save system at least make the checkpoints closer together.

That being said this is still a great game.  Definitely fun on Normal difficulty, and if it wasn't for the save system problem it would be even more fun on ""Realistic"".

Now you can't customized the character you play beyond some color schemes however while you can't change the superficial you can definitely make your character all your own by choosing particular skills from the skill trees as you level and by what type, brand, and model weapons you choose to use.

The Single player game doesn't have a great and engaging story in a nutshell ""your here, there is a macguffin out there, find it"" however the quests, characters, and funny tidbits along the way definitely paint a colorful world full of flavor and spirit. The real gem of the game is the four player Co-op. In the Xbox version you can do this online with 4 buddies, or find 4 random people. This increases the difficulty of the creatures in the world and yields better items from vendors and loot drops.

If you have some pals willing to invest in a solid title pick this up. If you don't mind random people pick it up yourself. If you just like shooting things and having a laugh, pick it up.","Quality game, unique graphics, Co-Op for the win!",1317513600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Having played each generation of this game there is always a learning curve when the interface changes.  It's the little things they seemed to improve on.  Far too many to name but things like not having to scan a newspaper for several days to get the job you want for your sim.  If your sim is grumpy when they cook they will slam the fridge door.  You don't have to listen to the carpool horn every day!  Buy mode and build mode have been combined together.

I think the only thing I haven't liked is the open world is gone.  You can move around outside your house only so far  (couple houses in either direction), but if you want to visit a family next door you still have to travel there.  Very limited  places to visit.  But you can visit other neighborhoods instead of being confined to one neighborhood and then any special expansion places like china, or the future, or vacation spots.

He's able to navigate through the menus and the levels by himself, though the Kinect won't recognize his voice. It's a pretty active game as you have to actually run through almost every level.

The idea behind the game is you are visiting a theme park with a different land for each of the movies (Incredibles, Ratatouille, Cars, Toy Story, and Up). Each land has 3 levels and the story between each level is only loosely tied together. Ratatouille, Toy Story, Up, and Incredibles are all very similar in mechanics and strategy. It's disappointing the game has such poor recognition using the Kinect. I think the first Kinect games such as Kinect Adventures and Kinect Sports do a better job with motion recognition. My kid doesn't seem to mind, though, and navigates through the levels anyway.

The Cars levels were very well done and driving using the Kinect is pretty easy.

Oh, also the menu structure to start the game is irritating. It's fun that the game uses the Kinect to scan you and create a character that looks kind of similar to your actual appearance, but it asks too many questions before letting you play the game.

After completing Act I, I can say this game is definitely worth the price they're asking for it right now, even if the game ends act II, but it's feeling like it's going to act V.  The locales are beautiful, and there are no polygons, only beautiful partial fx and smooth animation.  It does tax my system a bit but the fan just spins up and I get the 60 fps with v-sync I configured, all settings maxed. It's just a typical modern i7 system. ymmv

I give it 4 stars over all, because I did have to wait like a day and a half to play it due to authentication server issues, single player... That's just bad.  I'm sure there's a DRM system out there that doesn't require more then a 32 bit packet to authenticate and play.  There's a lot of little glitches in the gui that feel unrefined.  Sometimes, there feels like there's lag? I'm playing single player.  The game will rewind in time like something glitched out and it restored from 600ms back. I'm sure this is just... release week issues.  It just makes me wonder how much of this can be attributed to the DRM system.

Still, the game is beautiful and the leveling system, which I haven't even touched upon, is also addictive, simple, customizable, yet perfectly adaptable enough for the kind of builds you can do with your rare & random drops you'll see as you hack your way through thousands of insane and horrific monsters from hell.

4.0,False,"10 6, 2010",A32FDGA30QCLRX,B003Z0LFJC,Scott P.,"Arkham Asylum was a bit of a fluke last year.  No one expected the game to be any good since most comic book games were usually mediocre at best.  Sometimes, like in the case of Superman 64, they are horrible, but mostly mediocre.  With Arkham Asylum's success, it seems a lot of game companies are trying their hand at releasing a new and exciting comic game that will wow fans into buying the game.  Spider Man: Shattered Dimension is Activision's attempt at doing so and to be honest, they come close.

The premise of the story is that Mysterio broke into a museum and while Spider Man was giving chase, a rare artifact was smashed and screwed up the rifts of time and space.  The artifacts were each sent to a different universe (4 to be exact) each with their own version of Spidey.  The first is the regular Spider Man universe you know and love...the one that you can read on the comic stands today, aka: Amazing Spider Man.  The second is Spider Man Noir, a 1920's style Spider Man that uses dark leather and the shadows to his advantage.  Third, there's Spider Man 2099, the Spider Man from the future who actually isn't even Peter Parker.  He is technologically advanced and most of his combat takes place above skyscrapers in a futuristic city.  Finally, there's teenage Spidey who has the Venom symbiote attached to him.  But, the Venom symbiote doesn't control him with the help of a mysterious old woman and he just uses it to his advantage.  Anyways, that's the premise.  There's an old woman/sage who ties all the Spidey's together and you take turns chasing down the enemies and whooping their asses to get back the pieces of the relic to restore the space time continuum thingy and make life better again.  It's a comic book story, don't expect anything stellar.

The story actually helps the game out because you get to switch characters a lot.  The normal spider man is sort of a jack of all trades  The Noir Spidey can't get hit a lot or he dies so his levels are very stealth oriented.  2099 is very combat oriented with a lot of high flying escapades (being that it takes place on top of skyscrapers).  Finally, symbiote spider is also combat oriented with a lot of zipping around from place to place and unleashing your rage mode (thanks to the symbiote).  The gameplay is varied enough to keep you occupied but there is also something else that will hold your attention...

The enemies.  Yes, the enemies are one of the best things in this game.  Each level is a different enemy and they are all superbly done.  In the beginning of the level you meet your foe and you spend the rest of the level tracking them down to get back the piece of artifact they stole.  Of course, it would be a comic if they didn't do something bad, like use the artifact to grant them strength or a unique power, so your strategy in boss fights is always two fold.  For example, Hammerhead, Noir's first boss, has you sticking to the shadows and sneaking to the ground at the last minute so Hammerhead uses his gun on some derelict machinery.  The explosion causes a cloud of smoke to appear and you have to jump to the roof and wait to pick him off while he can't see you.  After you do this 4 times, you are now on the ground with an overpowered head charging Hammerhead and you need to dive out of the way while he rams his head into the wall.  There's not much button pushing mayhem in this, you're usually going to need a plan.

The game also has a nice touch of RPG element to it.  As you enter each level, you can glance at a web in the menus that has different challenges you can meet.  If you meet these challenges, you get experience points you can spend on upgrades to all Spidey characters (this is usually health or something similar) or a specific Spidey move (combat moves, rage benefits, etc.)  You could take the time to do each challenge and when you meet a boss be a little overpowered (but not much) or just play the game ignoring them and be fine just the same.  They aren't deal breakers and really just provide extra moves for you to play around with.  The health benefits and some of the other upgrades may be required on some harder difficulties, but you get experiences from other things besides doing the challenge.  This light RPG element is a welcome addition to the game.

Another thing you'll love about the game - the graphics.  Each universe has a different art style.  The main Spider Man universe has a very cartoony/comic book look to it.  The other worlds each have their own unique graphic style and it's really cool switching between each and noticing the difference.

So, I've said a lot of good about the game, now for the bad, well, not so good.  Plain and simple, the game gets boring.  I'm a Spider Man fan and I found myself getting bored with the combat from time to time, especially on levels I had to play a couple times due to dying.  There is a lot of platforming in some levels and the stealth in the Noir levels can be frustrating as the camera tends to not know whether you are on a wall or the ground.  This is a big issue when you need to take out a couple enemies silently or else they'll kill a civilian, ending your mission and game consequently.  Also, on a much smaller note, the voice work is great, but very repetitive.  Be ready to hear the same one lines over and over and over again as Spider Man constantly belts out funny for the first 100 times comments about the enemies.

All in all, the game is pretty good.  Is it good enough to go out and buy?  Ehh, maybe a rent.  Actually, definitely a rent, probably not a buy.  If you are a completionist and like comic books, then you'll love this game.  The game gives you a percentage value of completion (a la GTA) and allows you to replay levels at your will.  There's plenty of achievements for all you junkies out there and the game is a good one to play over a long weekend.  Just don't expect a riveting story and be prepared for some repetitive gameplay.",Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions Review,1286323200,,"{'Edition:': ' Game with Bonus Art Concept Book', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

4.0,True,"09 29, 2014",AG3GX5JBHS587,B00JFCA6V2,Nozapalooza,"This review is for the Refurbished Edition of the Vita 1000 OLED model.
I saved up 10 weeks allowance for this machine and a week before leaving town, finally had enough dough to pull the trigger. I was so excited that I actually did an unboxing video for it. (search Youtube - ""Amazon Refurbished Vita 1000 Unboxing"" I also knew that it did not come with a memory card or any games so part of the ""save up"" was for the separate accessory starter kit which comes with a memory card. I also had to save up for  a couple of PSN downloads Lemmings and Escape Plan.  My unit arrived two days before we left for vacation and was in very, Very, good condition. This baby was almost mint and I would also call it ""Perfect"". It arrived neatly boxed in the white packaging shown in the user photos. I don't know if these are actually sent back to a ""factory"" per se, but they are at least fixed and cleaned up by someone who clearly knows what they are doing. The white corrugated box was fabricated in Indiana, so I am fairly certain that these were packaged by someone in the USA.
Inside the box I found:
One OLED PSVita 1000 in pristine condition.
Two basic documentation booklets in French and English.
One wall power cable.
Two power bricks ? (should have only come with one)
Zero/No USB to Vita Proprietary cables required to charge the unit !

You read correctly : TWO power bricks and NO PROPRIETARY USB CABLE required to charge the unit or transfer data.

Basically the charging cable comes in three pieces : A, B, and C.
I received one A, two B, and zero C.

The Vita 1000 arrived with a dead battery, so you can imagine my disappointment when I couldn't even get it to turn on.
I'll jump in here and state that Amazon ""made it right"" and I am happy now with my purchase after getting the cable, but I did not realize how not-so-common these cables are. I remember when the Vita first came out, the shelves at Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Gamestop and Toys R Us were loaded with these cables and other fun Vita accessories. Fast forward a couple of years, and most of these retailers don't stock any of these accessories anymore. Where I live, finding an OEM Sony branded, proprietary Vita1000 USB cable is not quite so easy. Different aftermarket reviews warn about the trials and perils of using a cheap aftermarket cord which may or may not fit properly, and or damage the unit and cause it to not charge correctly. Leaving for vacation in just a couple of days, I didn't want to wait for an Amazon order to arrive when I was out of town, so I called EVERYWHERE. No one within a hundred miles of a major metro east coast market  had this thing in stock.  Needless to say, I ended up finally finding one place that had an Energizer Car/Home Charger which contained an aftermarket PSP/Vita charging cable on one end. This split cable, while cool in concept, is less than ideal as the PSP pigtail often bumps the Vita screen when I am using the cord to charge or transfer data to the Vita. After some time on the phone, Amazon did reimburse me for the aftermarket cable I was able to find, but the unit should have come with the original OEM cable and it didn't. SOO Frustrating when I opened the box.  I think someone in the packaging facility just made an error. I should also add that Amazon offered me several options on how to handle the situation all of which were to my satisfaction, but I just didn't have time to execute any of them until I returned home a week later.
  The unit itself is great, and just what I wanted. The OLED screen is absolutely Gorgeous. The Green on Lemmings is brilliant, and the deep blacks in Escape Plan contrast amazingly with bright whites. The condition of the item was perfect and had it come with the USB cable which it was supposed to have would have been as advertised. There is a small risk of additional frustration with the Refurb which I experienced first hand, but I am pleased with the final outcome as well as the experience with the Amazon customer service reps. Even with the hassle, I am still happy I got the original model with the nice screen. The newer Vita has a MUCH more common non-proprietary micro-usb charging/ data cable which you may already have. Just keep in mind that you can't just run down to the corner gamestop and pickup a couple extra cables if you lose this unique key component which has since been discontinued with the launch of the Vita 2000. It's a factor to consider, but I still recommend the older one with the nicer screen.",OLED is fabulous. Condition of unit is Perfect.

4.0,True,"01 7, 2014",A3DA8HAPITL71S,B00AXI9XIE,Michael Dixon,"I got this for my daughter (10) as a Christmas gift. I spent quite a bit of time researching exactly WHAT this was, how it worked, and what the ""social"" activities were like, since I didn't want her interacting with strangers without my knowledge or supervision. To be honest, even after visiting Disney's website for Disney Infinity, along with other non-Disney sites, I was still a bit confused about how all of this works. The figurines, the power discs, toy boxes, play sets.it all was confusing and the details from Disney were too minimalistic. But it was from Disney and I decided to take the leap. I also bought the two Frozen characters and the ""Cars"" play set (two characters and new adventures).

We opened up the box and it was shocking for a Disney product not to really have clear-cut instructions. The PS3 game blu-ray disc had a booklet in it, and it had basic instructions, so as a computer savvy person, I had no issues, but I expected something a bit more family friendly.

There is quite a bit of data that gets copied to your Playstation 3's hard disc, so be prepared to wait a while for that data to get transferred. When the game finally started, the introduction was typical Disneyinventive, original, yet a bit  minimalistic (nothing to tell you what to dojust a little spark glowing on the screen in a darkened world). My daughter soon figured out that whatever it touches, it lights up. Still, if your child doesn't know how to control the PS3 controller, there will be a learning curve. Our daughter was used to the Wii, so the PS3 was new to her.

Don't lose any of the pieces that come with Disney Infinity, character play sets, or other things. They all interact with that USB ""pad"" that connects to your Playstation. I'm guessing they have radio transmitters in the bottom that help the game identity what character you want to use.

Play sets come with characters and full adventure games (like any other game for the Playstation). The starter pack came with 3 full-sized adventure games for Pirates of the Caribbean, The Incredibles, and Monsters University. You can only play the full games with the character(s) that belong in those worlds (Mr. Incredible can't play in Monsters Univ., etc.).  There are also shorter mini-games you can play in those environments with any characters, and you can usually play two players at a time (if you have two PS3 controllers). It does a split screen in those circumstances.

The Toy Box reminds me a bit of Minecraft, but much more refined and graphically pleasing. You start in a toy box that has Cinderella's castle in it, and if you're not careful, you can really destroy stuff quickly (too easy to delete things without knowing it). This was one of the biggest weaknesses of our experience so far: absolutely no direction in terms of how to manipulate the world. There are mastery adventures (training) on combat, building, and driving. I would strongly recommend doing these first. We made a mess of the default toy boxso much so that I had to go back and start it over. That's another thingI never know when to save the game's progress. It does some auto-saving, but unlike other Disney Interactive games, this game is more typical of Playstation adult gamesyou must remember to save often!

The adventure game play and visuals? Well, it reminds me of a combination between the Lego games (collecting sparks and coins everywhere you go) and previous Disney Interactive games where your character runs around doing tasks and completing challenges. The graphics remind me a lot of the Lego video games: fairly plain in design but still detailed enough to entertain. I can see why they rated this for ages 10 and up. It can get quite difficult, especially the combat combinations. Luckily, when a task is given, the game will offer to provide a compass to the player to guide them to the objectivea nice touch for younger players.

The soundtrack music has been awesome. The music seems to be taken from the movies that inspired the game play. The voice overs, for the most part, seem to be from the original actors who did them in the Disney films. That's a plus.

The graphics aren't the quality of Assassin's Creed or Heavy Rain (realistic detail makes those two games shine), nor should you expect Pixar animation or character detail, but for kids, it works fine.

The power discs (round ones) sit under a character and give them special powers or abilities. You can stack several under a character. The other discs (6-sided) can change the environment (the ones that came with the Frozen figurines turned our Toy Box into a frozen wonderland.

Just don't expect a full adventure game to come with all the additional characters you see in the stores. Those are just characters (some come with their own toy box themes), but only the figurines that actually are called ""play sets"" actually come with full-blown new adventure games. That's why they cost $30+.

Overall, I can see how this could explode for Disney. They have so many worlds in their movies (Tron, Little Mermaid, the list is huge) that haven't been tapped yet. So far, I think the Pirates play set (world) has looked the best, with realistic ocean waves and at-sea action/combat that is fun. We'll be trying out the Cars, Incredibles, and Monsters U worlds later on, but considering that they are all full-blown games themselves, along with the ability to create your own world (and even create games in them too), the replay value is pretty staggering now that I've taken time to learn how it works and plays. I may have to invest in another PS3, since my PS3 is likely to be dominated by the use of our 10 year old for the foreseeable future!","First impressions here, overall impression still out",1389052800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PLAYSTATION 3'}",

The top to the back of the mouse is very smooth, and the sides where you put your thumb and pinky on has a very light but rough texture to it so your fingers don't slip. The sniper button works well, but it does take some time getting used to positioning your thumb there and quickly switching back to your normal finger positioning. Clawing and palm gripping are both very easy to do. The mouse itself looks very sharp and clean. The lighting is decent, I would have loved a bit more, but that's just preference. The software is very basic and simple to use and download, and the DPI buttons on the mouse work very well. Knowing 8200 DPI is pretty high for me, I chop it down to about 5700-6000 and the movement is precise. Comparing it to my 'Razer Taipan' it's pretty neck and neck aside from the size. M65 is much bigger and is a nice size. Fits and tracks well on my 'Razer Vespula.' Now for the weights that come with it I didn't see a purpose using them because the mouse itself already has a nice weight to it, but that's just me. I'm sure that there are people out there that enjoy having all the weights in at once. The only con, and this is really not a HUGE deal, would be the scroll button.

And some of there successes are through there video games. LEGO Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Harry Potter etc. So it came to no surprise when LEGO announced there would be a LEGO Jurassic World video game. If you've played one before, it's the same old but with new characters and a different movie. So let's just briefly discuss the pros and cons of Jurassic World.

Pros

If you love LEGO and the Jurassic Park series, then this is just a fantastic game. It's great for kids if you want to introduce them to Jurassic Park, since there's no real violence besides LEGO characters falling apart, and it has it's LEGO humor we've come to expect. It has tons of collectibles, and I do mean tons. There are mini kits, red and gold bricks, more than 100 characters and 20 dinosaurs to unlock as well. So there's plenty to do to keep you busy. LEGO has incorporated in ""open world"" aspect. It is a interesting idea, but personally don't feel it was done too well which I will explain in the cons section. Also, it's a very nice looking game, even on the PS3.

Cons

Glitches. I've encountered a few glitches while playing. Mostly during open world game play. When I would try to switch my character it would not let me do so for quite a while until I exited my loaded game, went to the menu and re-entered. Frame rate issues occasionally occurred, but not too often. The thing I didn't like was the open world game play. Normally LEGO gives you some type of hub world where you can easily access the levels. With Jurassic World they changed the formula up with exploring the island and solving puzzles to get to each level. The reason I haven't enjoyed it is due to most of the glitches happened during these moments, and I did not like the map that's supposed to help you get around the area. Some may like this, but for me it just felt like a process to get to the actual levels that I wanted to play.

Despite a few cons, LEGO Jurassic World is a great game for young kids, LEGO fans, and anyone that loves the Jurassic Park series. Geek out as you witness the iconic scenes in LEGO style.","Flawed, but another success in the LEGO Series.",1434758400,10,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"08 29, 2012",A14ZS48R78ZK2J,B00149PCAO,SuperGamecube64,"My first impression of Mirror's Edge was that it looked extremely unique. After playing it, I can say that my assessment was spot on. I have never before played a game quite like Mirror's Edge, and I have reason to believe that you haven't either.

Imagine a world where everything is censored and monitored. You can't even send an email or a letter without a government middleman stepping in. All the phone lines are tapped. everything on the internet is closely monitored. How would you then transport sensitive or private information? That is where ""runners"" come into the picture. These parkour practitioners will get your package delivered safely, discretely and effectively without anyone knowing. Traveling across the rooftops of towering skyscrapers, through ventilation systems, or whatever else will get them to their destination the fastest, these people will get your items delivered in record time. In Mirror's Edge, you play one such runner named Faith. Faith's mission is much more important than delivering a package - her sister Kate, who is a cop (or a ""blue"" as the runners call them) has been framed for murder. Faith is trying to uncover the truth and prove her sister's innocence.

Mirror's Edge is played in the first person view point, and while there is very brief gun-play, it is not a first person shooter. It is more akin to a first person platformer or adventure. You always have a destination you are trying to reach, and you may use anything in the environment that you can grab onto, jump off of, or run across to reach your goal. If you ever get lost, and don't know where to head, you can hold down the B button (on Xbox 360) and Faith will automatically look in exactly the direction you need to be heading. Additionally, any object that you can grab or jump from is highlighted red when you come near (except on hard mode). Faith is very fragile, so if you fall from very high, she will die. Additionally, if ""blues"" are in the vicinity, combat is best avoided unless it is a directive. While Faith knows hand to hand combat, she will still die in just 2 or 3 hits.

Mirror's Edge has very tight controls, though they take a few minutes to adjust to. Once you have them down, which should take about half an hour at most, you'll be scaling rooftops, sliding under pipes and throat chopping blues like you did it for a living. I'll be using the Xbox 360 controller to explain the controls, as this is the system I played the game on. As you probably guessed, the left stick controls movement and the right stick controls where you are looking. There is no need to press or hold a button to run faster. As you move, you slowly gain speed and momentum - so, if you need to make a long jump from one room to another, all you need is the proper distance to gain the momentum. Speaking of, jumping is handled by the left bumper, which also controls grabbing ledges. This may feel awkward at first, but ultimately this makes the game easier to control and more fluid. The right bumper causes you to perform a 180 degree turn. So, if you press left bumper at a will, you will wall run up the wall about 4 steps. If you then press right bumper while on the wall, immediately followed by the left bumper again, you will kick off the wall in the opposite direction. When you land when jumping or falling from a great height, you will need to press left trigger with the proper timing to roll upon landing and break your fall. Left trigger also causes you to crouch while on the ground, or the slide while running, allowing to to slide under pipes, doors, etc. The A button is used to interact with buttons such as elevator calls, the X button enters ""reaction time"", which is slow motion and can be used once per stage. As previously mentioned, holding B will cause Faith to look at your goal. the right trigger handles attacking as well as barging into doors. When you press the right trigger while stationary, Faith will punch. While crouching, it will cause her to kick. If you run, crouch and then press the right trigger, she will slide kick. Finally, if you jump and press the right trigger, she will perform a jump kick. If you get close to a ""blue"", and he tries to melee you, his weapon will at some point during his swing flash red, usually for only a brief second. If at this time you press Y, you will disarm and take out that enemy. Additionally, if there is a weapon lying on the ground from a defeated enemy, you may press Y to pick it up, and fire with the right trigger. Gun-play is a tad sloppy, but I think they intended this. Faith is not a sharpshooter - she is a runner. She is not good with guns. This isn't a huge setback, however. The Y button also drops a weapon if you are holding one.

The graphics in Mirror's Edge are truly gorgeous. The detail on clothing, such as Faith's pants, is astounding. Environments have a mostly sterile feel, being mostly white. This is offset by the glowing red objects that you may utilize. When inside of buildings, there is usually a central pastel color theme - usually blue, green, orange, or yellow. The lighting in this game is also very bright. Occasionally, it can be a tad blinding. Perhaps this effect was desired, but it may be annoying occasionally. If this becomes a problem, try adjusting the brightness settings in the game or on your television. Cutscenes surprisingly don't use these gorgeous visuals. They instead use a beautiful art style of their own. They are 2D and cel shaded, giving cutscenes a distinct anime look, but with enough flavor of its own for it not to technically be anime.

Mirror's edge has a bit of replay value as well. Though the campaign is relatively short, there are several challenge and speedun maps, more of which can be downloaded will keep you occupied for a while if you let them. Additionally, each level in the story has 3 hidden runner bags. These bags, dropped or left behind by other runners are cleverly hidden and require tricky tactics to reach. A nice touch for the completionist out there.

I honestly don't have a lot of complaints about mirror's edge. It is a very unique experience. Difficulty mostly stems from combat, and if you get stuck you'll find a solution relatively quickly. The story is also quite short. The music, which mostly consists of piano melodies and techno, is almsot unnoticeable most of the time. This makes it relaxing, however.

If you have $20 burning a hole in your pocket, and you are looking for a unique game to occupy you for a bit, Mirror's Edge is well worth looking into.",Very Unique,1346198400,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

With different levels including Aztecs, Caverns, Castles, Forests, and of course, a jungle, and five different playable characters each with their own abilities and golden bananas (similar to stars in Super Mario 64) to collect, you would think Donkey Kong 64 would never get old. And it won't. For a while.

The plot goes something like this - King K. Rool has another scheme. He's taken all of Donkey Kong's precious golden bananas and kidnapped all his friends. You'll have to navigate through a series of levels, rescuing different characters in each of them, unlocking golden bananas as you go, to eventually reach the final stage. Each level has its own boss which are usually the best part of the level. To reach the boss, you'll have to collect a certain number of regular bananas (scattered throughout the level, different from golden bananas). A certain number of golden bananas unlocks a new level. If you ever want to complete the game, you'll have to rescue all of Donkey's companions. Diddy, Tiny, Lanky, and Chunky Kong all await you in the first three levels. Meanwhile, you buy instruments from Candy, potions from Cranky, and Weapons from Funky. All these can be upgraded. The things you buy, especially Cranky's potions, will give you abilities that are essential to collecting all the golden bananas. There are also various barrel mini games that you must complete in order to finally get the banana.

Donkey Kong has graphics and gameplay very similar to Banjo Kazooie/Tooie. So, those who liked those two games will love DK64. Also, fans of the Donkey Kong franchise will not be let down. Donkey Kong 64 is addictive and you'll always love exploring the new environments the game places you in. There's always aspects to the level that are unique and also crucial to getting golden bananas (For example, in the forest level, there is a giant clock that switches the game between day and night. Some bananas can only be reached at certain times of the day.). The degrees of difficulty for getting the bananas range from stupidly easy to impossible. Many, however, are just pure fun. Overall, DK64 is a very enjoyable game and good for all ages.

A certain degree of frustration does come with the game, however. Some golden bananas are impossible to get you do absolutely everything right. You'll do lots of falling and retrying (especially in the factory level) to reach some. Another irk is that you must get two coins in order to advance to the final boss stages. You must beat the original Donkey Kong and Jetpak. The problem is, no matter what, I could not beat the original Donkey Kong, which prevented me from beating the game. I spent so many wasted hours trying to beat that stupid game. Last, this game requires an expansion pack. Nowadays, expansion packs are hard to come by and cost about $20, which is probably five times more than the actual game will cost you.

Other than that, Donkey Kong 64 is great fun. Even if you don't manage to get through the whole game, it is a very worthwhile title and surely a great value, especially now. You won't be disappointed with Donkey Kong 64, unless of course you're currently enrolled in an anger management class.",DK64,1181433600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

A few things have been removed from the game to make it DS friendly, but nothing that seems to hinder gameplay or fun.  But, nothing really has been added to the game (at least in single player mode.)  So, while I thought Animal Crossing GC was a great game, I wasn't completely addicted as many were... and I was hoping to see some differences (meaning additions.)  There isn't even really a good implementation of the touch screen.

However, none of the fun of the original has been lost, either.

So, if you're craving another run through another crazy, tree shaking, hole digging, crazy animal quest running adventure... there's nothing to complain about here.

I would believe some people would find this game very boring... honestly, the majority of the game revolves around scrounging things up to sell so you can pay off your house debt and decorate your pad... but I have yet to meet anyone who was bored with it!  Something about this game makes it highly addictive... even if it is just the simple joy of seeing what your town store sells each day.  (Because, like the first game, days and seasons pass in real time!  But, this time around, seemingly no holidays.)

Now, the WiFi capabilities DO add a little something to the game.  After hooking up with a friend (or friends) you can visit each other's towns, buy and trade their items, and even dig large holes all over their town...

Hooking up, on the other hand, presents some problems.  Basically this:  it isn't easy.  You need to enter your friend's code into your game, and vice versa.  Then, you need to both be online at the same time.  Getting codes from personal friends is pretty simple;  coordinating codes with one of the many people on online message boards, since you need BOTH codes, is nearly impossible.  Which can be good!  It makes it much more difficult for children to play the game with questionable strangers... especially when you consider these visitors will be leaving you written messages (whatever they want to write) and pictures in the form of constellations.  (I've seen a few... 'questionable'... things so far, but fortunately not many.)  Also, if you don't have a WiFi hookup at home, this feature is going to be useless... unless you want to get together and go sit at McDonalds for a few hours.

No matter what though, the most important thing about this game is this:  it is terribly terribly addictive.  Well worth your purchase money (even if there isn't much new here) and is going to suck up large portions of your time...

Don't get  me wrong, because it's a highly entertaining game for a while, and a  wonderful example of how to do a party game. I played it at a friend's  house and even the people who were least into video games (who never played  them except for this instance) had lots of fun.
Also, if you're expecting  anything approaching an RPG, this really isn't the game for you. I  personally have a background of mudding on hack-n-slash CircleMUDs, and so  I found the game format very natural, but people who are looking for more  storyline elements and character development are going to be disappointed,  as in the end this game is about killing monsters and getting gold. There  are some okay puzzle elements to the game, but the system is fairly  limited.
One other tangential point to this game is that it has a _very_  good soundtrack. As the levels get higher, the music gets better. In  particular, the music for the secret level Mausoleum (at the end of the  Castle Treasury level) is stellar.
In short, this is game provides for a  lot of fun, and can be fun for quite a while if you're looking for a  mindless timewaster (which certainly has its place), but for actually  wanting challenges and real goals, the game ends up falling off a bit too  soon.

I never thought I would buy a PS 3 but after hanging out at the stores to long during the Holiday shopping I ended up buying one. I must say, so far I'm very impressed. Its easy to see why Sony was charging a lot for this when it first came out, this thing is loaded and the fit/finish seems top notch. Compared to the Xbox 360 the PS3 seems very well thought out. The Xbox some days seems like something I built in my basement. The Xbox is so loud when you are playing a game. I can't figure out why MS would think anyone would want to watch a movie through their HD-DVD player as you would have to turn the movie sound way up to block out the 360's fans.

The PS graphics are very very good, and the blu ray dvd is just an added bonus to a very good game system for the new lower prices. Also, its nice to have the on-line game play be free, compared to the Xbox $50 a year. It's not that the xbox is bad, the PS3 is just more refined. I also expect fewer problems with the PS3 than the Xbox. I have only had one issue with the xbox, the tv connector cable went bad, but I know several people who have had 2-3 360's just die on them.

The Wii shouldn't be compared to the PS3 or the Xbox. Its a great game system with the innovative controlers and the easy to play games. Its the only system my wife will play and she never played games before. That is the beauty of the Wii, it truly is a game system for everyone.

Rome: Total War, Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War, and Shogun: Total War are the RTS games I love the most even more so than what I have on my XBOX or GameCube.  However, when Full Spectrum Warrior was released I was just overjoyed.  Finally there was a game that forced you to use your brain instead of relying on your shooting skills.  Although FSW was brilliant in its own right it did not seem to be enough since I did not have the ability to fire at the enemy myself.

Much similar and at the same time refreshingly dissimilar to FSW is this amazing game that I've recently bought Brothers in Arms.  Although the subject of the WWII American paratrooper is becoming somewhat overexposed and maybe tiresome in movies and recent programs (Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers), and in videogames (which I do not have to mention), trying to experience his hard reality of war is not boring in the least especially when you have to lead them on the battlefield and to save your own skin.

In the game much like FSW you must command teams to move here and there strategically of course to beat the enemy.  The common technique is to first use one team to fire on the enemy (you know who) in order to keep them suppressed and unable to fight back effectively.  You'll be amazed how inaccurate yet incessant small-arms fire will keep enemy heads down.  That's what it does.  The other team or even you yourself, since you are autonomous, can outflank the enemy.  That is the name of the game!  You command a good number of men and you are able to participate in the battle; Full Spectrum Warrior has the strategy but not the first person perspective to take part in the battle; Medal of Honor and Call of Duty have the intense FPS action but you don't have the ability to utilize certain allies to help you win.

Thank goodness though that your AI comrades in this game are really on their toes!  They think on their own when they need to.  That is they can find cover and fire when necessary.  I wish Ghost Recon 2 was just as good.  This aspect lends much realism to the game.

As far as graphics and audio are concerned each is exceptional.  The weapons-fire is just amazing and arguably sounds better than MoH or CoD if you can believe that.

The storyline is taken from actual events so expect no hokey special missions like stealing a special Nazi jet fighter or stealing secret plans from some general's mansion in the heart of Germany in this game.  You'll be participating in realistic missions like securing villages, capturing machinegun nests, and wiping out mortar sections with a team of men at your disposal.

The Guitar Hero series has finally ported over to the XBox platform- and takes a step up the console ladder by reaching the current generation of graphics. The game is of course awesome, but there is so much more they could have done.

First, the great part. This game is incredibly fun. We've played the PlayStation versions for hours and hours. When we took the XBox version home, we played it for hours straight that first night. The interface is great, the songs are great, and you really get hooked into the fun. Sure, not every person will love every song. You'll have to play a few you don't adore to progress through the career mode. Still, there are enough that you really love to keep you going.

With Guitar Hero II there's a great two player mode where one person plays guitar and the other plays the bass line. It's really a ton of fun.

Why would we get the XBox version when we have the PS2 version? First, we don't keep the PS2 in the main living room any more on the high def TV, so having the XBox 360 version means we can enjoy it easily with friends when they come over. Second, you can download new songs! I realize they only have 9 new songs as of launch, but I'm of course hoping they create an entire library for us to play with. That makes the game infinitely fun.

The graphics really don't matter at all. When you're playing, all you're watching is the series of notes coming at you, and listening to the music. As long as you have your TV hooked into a great stereo, you're pretty much all set.

With all this greatness, what's not wonderful? Well, first, everything in the new generation is wireless. We keep our consoles back on the wall because of this. Our networks are all wireless. It's really odd to have a controller come out that is required to wire into the console. Rumor is that they tried to make a wireless version and didn't get it done ""in time"" to release the game - but I would rather they have waited until the game was really ready.

Next, the guitar layout itself is really odd. The start / select buttons are TINY and are extremely far from the finger positions. This makes them pretty much useless. I've also heard that many people had defective guitars where the bar would not work. Nothing is more frustrating than playing a game and not having the controller respond properly.

When you buy new songs, you are forced to buy them in sets of three - even if you only want one in the set. This is of course an easy way for them to rack up much higher sales prices for themselves. A few of them are games from Guitar Hero I which obviously they had already coded, and just chose not to include for free in GHII.

If you don't own any of the Guitar Hero series, and you have an XBox 360, then certainly buy Guitar Hero II from your XBox 360. The game is incredibly fun and you should have at least one copy in the house. If you already own the PS2 version, then it's probably not worth it to upgrade.

If you'd like to save yourself the time of reading my entire review, here it is in a nutshell: Buy the game. It is the best FPS experience I've ever had. Wow. Just...wow -- at least as far as multiplayer (the core Battlefield experience) goes. Single player suffers from the same predictability that virtually all FPS single-player campaigns do, but what I have played of it so far has looked great and been roughly as entertaining as Bad Company 2 (which, if you're not familiar with it, is the best Battlefield single-player campaign to date in my opinion).

Multiplayer Review:

""Battlefield moments"" abound in BF4, especially in full rooms. Base-jump off a sky scraper. Drop c4 on a tank as you parachute down. Destroy the tank, killing the 2 guys inside, just before you land directly behind the sniper that's been plaguing your team from his little hideout. Knife him and take his dog tags...those types of sequences are happening every other map, and it's an adrenaline rush like no other. You can't get this type of action anywhere else. It really seems like the dev team focused on giving players as much creative license as they could, and it has paid off in a HUGE way.

BF4 addressed virtually all of my major complaints with BF3. Gone is the inexplicable lack of destructibility (mostly...there are still some walls that I feel should be destructible that are not). Gone are the funneling choke-points that made certain maps virtually unplayable from certain spawns. Gone is the horrid squad perk system (it's been replaced by one that works).

The maps are, in a word, incredible. I had MAJOR complaints with BF3 map design after experiencing the glory of BC2. If you felt that way at all...well, the maps in BF4 offer more routes to objectives, more creativity, and more tactical offensive opportunities. The DICE team REALLY stepped it up.

Class balance: The biggest change made here is that Recon is infinitely more useful now. The BC2 motion mine has made its return along with C4, and I've found the Recon class to be the most user-friendly to play out of the gate. Engineers seem *slightly* nerfed to me, but that could just be my dislike for their class weapons.

The weapons are all a joy to fire because the wild recoil on almost every weapon rewards skill and punishes spray-and-pray types. The new ""zeroing"" function is also extremely handy for sniping.

Vehicles also seem to have been well thought out. You actually start with defensive countermeasures now, so you don't have to suffer through a week of trying to level up your scout helicopter against heat-seeking missiles while you don't have flares.

My only fear: Server Renting. If it becomes possible for any Joe Schmo to rent a server from DICE like it was in BF3, the game will suffer the same problems. I do not know if DICE has a system in place to keep their ""official servers"" listed separately from rented ones (if they go that route). Nothing is more annoying than getting kicked from a game in which you're 18-1 because the admin thinks you're ""cheating"" -- just because you happened to kill him four times while he camped behind the same bush.

Single Player:

Obviously, if you've read above, I've spent most of my first few hours owning the game in Multi. I did play about 2 hours of single player, however, and found it to be entertaining and well-paced but predictable. There's not really a lot more to say about it there. It's worth playing, but you'll spend most of your time in multiplayer.

Although I think this game is considerably easier than the first, there will still be times where you want to throw the controller through the TV.  That's a good thing, if it was too easy it would not feel that you accomplished anything.

The first player mode (also playable in co-op!) is fairly long and you will want to play through it again if only to get accomplishments.  This game has the same problems the first had with movement.  You will unexpectedly get caught up on walls/objects frequently especially when running.  This can be frustrating at times and it breaks up your immersion in the game.

(Side Note:  Another problem I have is you must have a Gold account to play co-op.  I know this is fairly common for XBox games but I do not like having to pay a subscription to play online.  I do not want to debate XBox vs. PS3, they BOTH have their pros and cons.)

Gears 2 also has hoard mode and competitive/versus modes.  I have not played any versus modes.  Hoard mode is you and up to four others against waves of Locust.  Each wave gets progressively harder as you advance.  This mode was not as fun as I would have thought.  It seems the best way to get to the next wave is to set up a defensive area and wait for them to come to you.  I would have preferred to assault the Locust position but the numbers and types of Locust just will not allow that until you have substantially thinned them out. [Edit:] I freaking love Hoard mode now.  Me and a friend were able to get through all 50 levels and turned around and started over.  If you do private match you can start at any level you've previously reached which is nice for those that can't sit and play for hours on end.  If you join a public match you always start at level 1.  This works for finding friends but can't imagine getting through all 50 levels with a PUG. [/Edit]

In Epic Games' Unreal Tournament, that sight was setting Mars rising on the horizon as I dueled to the death on an orbiting space platform.  Yep, this is awesome.
While waltzing through a local department store, I happened upon this game for only ten bucks.  Being more used to games like Descent, I haven't played with too many FPS titles.  Quake and Red Faction were the only major ones I had any experience with, but I had heard nothing but good things about Unreal Tournament.  And for ten bucks, what the hey?
All I can say is WOW.  That ten dollars bought a game that I will play and enjoy for years to come.  Simply put, this is one of the highest-quality titles I've seen in a long time.  A fun and addictive FPS, UT redefined my expectations for an FPS game and is easily the greatest ""bargain bin"" title I've ever bought.
Out of the box, you get tons of levels and gameplay modes.  There is a single-player tourney, but you can play against the computer-controlled bots as well.  On-line, expect to see packed servers even to this day, several years after the game released.  UT also comes with an awesome game editor called UnrealEd that is relatively easy to use.  Tutorials are everywhere and new levels are released everyday to freshen up the UT experience.  Put bluntly, this game never gets old.  The graphics aged rather nicely, and the soundtrack is remarkably great.
Even when I compare it to Unreal Tournament 2003, which I later bought on account of the greatness of the original, UT still shines.  The awesome weapons, the varied arena settings, and the general ""feel"" of the game just aren't the same in UT2K3.  There is a certain beauty and elegance to this game, despite the lack of insane details as in UT2K3, that keeps me coming back to it.
Critiques?  I only have a few.  One, the netcode is rather sensitive to lag, such that if you aren't playing on a sub 100ms ping server, you might find that its unplayable (course, that's just my opinion).  Two, I wish there were more character models to use.  There are about a half-dozen in the game with only two or three ""skins"" apiece.  While it's enough to differentiate between players, there is too much repetition to it (UT2K3 addressed this by having tons of models to choose from).  And last, I tend to think that the game's sense of scale is a bit strange.  In many levels, including my own attempts, the players seem small compared to the environments around them.  This is even more prominent in UT2K3.  None of these flaws are major problems, however - more like tiny details and ways to improve what's already near perfect.
For merely ten bucks, you can't go wrong.  If you haven't played UT, you owe it to yourself to find and buy it.  Check the bargain software section at your local store.  This could very well be the finest FPS ever designed.","Fantastic Game, Fantastic Value",1060819200,,"{'Edition:': ' Game of the Year', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Many, many, many gamers loved the Mario games for being fun to play with and this game took the franchise to a whole new level. If you haven't played this particular NES game yet, shame on you. Back in the days, I rented this game out and was blown away by the graphics, sounds and variety of levels and its challenges.

Super Mario Bros. 3 lets you take control of Mario as you guide him through 8 worlds of various themes. They were all packed with stages with plenty of various challenges to overcome with the main goal being reaching and beating Bowser. What made this game remarkable was taking the essence of Super Mario Bros. and expanding it in every way possible. At your disposable, you had numerous power ups to use and many coins to collect to earn extra lives. You even had the ability to save power ups to use later in the game, which proved to be very useful. There were many secrets to uncover so it was worth playing this game over and over even if you beat it already.

Get this game and pass this on to those who never tried this out and get it if you, like me, missed out on purchasing the original cartridge back then. Or you can do this: take advantage of the Virtual Console Service up and running for the Wii and download this game for 500 points(US $5.00.)

I love westerns. Especially the classic Eastwood westerns, by far my favorites. Red Dead Redemption is all I ever wanted in a video game from this particular genre. The game takes a lot of influence from the Eastwood era westerns in particular. The soundtrack is a call back to those times, the gripping story, the world, and characters. After playing Red Dead Redemption and going back to watching some of the Eastwood westerns you can see where Rockstar found influence from this game. There are numerous characters in the game that are almost ripped out of many of those films. For example a character in the game, Nigel West Dickens clearly draws influence from the tonic salesman in Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales. Any fan of the western genre should love this game and even if you are not familiar with that particular genre, this is still a fantastic game.

The story follows the character John Marston. A man hired the Feds to track down his former gang mates and bring them to justice. It sort of follows your classic Western revenge story with a twist in that these men Marston is sent to track down were his old mates. He is a befitting anti-hero much like many of the characters Eastwood acted as in his films. The story is fantastic with one of the best and most shocking endings we have seen in a game. For those who have played, you know what I am talking about. For those who haven't you are in for a treat.

When it comes to game play, this game makes use of your typical third person mechanic founds in most Rockstar games. Anyone who has played GTAIV and GTAV will feel very familiar with the controls. The game introduces horse riding which while not the best does its job. The game is just fun in general. The online is one of my favorites and is a blast with friends.

Red Dead Redemption is a beautiful game. It has a fun, intense, and fantastic story. Truly remarkable. I highly recommend playing this game to anyone who hasn't and you can get it for cheap. It is one of the best games of last gen and one of the best ever made. It is also in my opinion Rockstar's best game. I can't wait to hop back into it on my Xbox One.

Combat Flight Simulator is, after all, one heck of a World War II buff's dream games, so I figured its Pacific counterpart would be as good.
I have to admit that I am not the best of pilots.  I still fly at the most basic of realism levels in Combat Flight Simulator (Europe), and that is enough of a challenge.  Facing off German bombers and fighters with Rookie-level artificial intelligence is tough, and I still am not skilled enough to set my realism settings (flight models, ammo loads, enemy skill levels, and sometimes invincibility levels) to 100%
Nevertheless, having completed the two Campaigns in the European theater, I recently decided to try Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2:  WWII Pacific Theater.
Although it is similar to its European-set predecessor, CFS2 is markedly different in many ways, both good and not-so-good.
First, the good:
Like CFS1, it immerses players into its WWII setting, using historically accurate settings and time-appropriate aircraft (you don't get Corsairs or Hellcats in early 1942, for instance).  Unlike CFS1, however, the title scenes and end-of-mission screens are rendered in 1940s comic-book style art, which I find more fun than the European Theater game's more documentary-style narration.  I like the ""you are there"" feel of a more story-oriented game premise that has comic book panel art and a narrative voice over that reminds one of either personal war logs or pilots' letters to loved ones back home.
Also as in CFS1, players can fly for either the Americans or the Japanese, although thus far I have only been playing as an American.  Because I have only been flying for seven ""months"" (in the game, not real life), I am still only an ensign, even though I have almost 25 aerial victories and several medals and commendations in my ""jacket"" (service record file).
The game's basic flight control commands are nearly identical to the WWII Europe simulation, although here one has commands that affect artificial-intelligence wingmen.  I have had a hard time getting the hang of this (more on the negatives later, I promise), but with trial and error I am learning.
The graphics, like in many computer advances, are improved from the older game.  The scenery is a bit monotonous in some battles, but that's because the Pacific war took place over large expanses of ocean, with sometimes little or no land below to use for reference points.  The ships here look better than in CFS1, and the planes themselves are beautifully rendered.  I particularly like the visuals when I hit a Japanese plane: if hit just right, Zeroes and Betty bombers have a tendency to catch fire easily.  Microsoft's game designers render this quite nicely, and because the Japanese fighters are particularly difficult to hit in the first place, I just feel so rewarded when flames spurt out of a Zero's cowling and the Mitsubishi product spirals down with a trail of realistic smoke.
The flight models, I assume, are as realistic as game designers can make them.  I've noticed that Japanese fighters are much harder to hit than the German planes from CFS1, and that even enemy planes with ""pilots"" and ""gunners"" at Rookie level are deadlier.  I humbly admit that my realism settings are all at zero per cent; I tried one mission using settings similar to the ones I have on CFS1, and got shot down fairly easy.
The negative features are things that are missing in the game rather than how hard it is to play or the graphics.  Sorely missed is a hard-copy manual.  CFS1 had one, and although it is somewhat intimidating to look at - many game players hate thick manuals - it is nice to know one can read up on how to fly and fight.  Most of the manual of the European Theater game helps gamers understand and learn the context of the game, as well as providing the basics of flight and survival in combat without bogging down into boring technical detail.  CFS2, on the other hand, comes in a smaller box and has all its instructions on Help files.  That is fine for gamers who hate reading manuals or are naturally-born-flyers. But for me, a manual or even a keyboard command card would have been helpful: I still don't know, for instance, how to drop a bomb...which in a few missions has cost me valuable points.  Maybe the ""online manual"" feature saves Microsoft a few bucks, but it's giving me fits.
The other flaw I see is that it focuses on American naval aviation rather than the multi-service aspect of the Pacific air war.  True, CFS1 has a similarly small aircraft selection: only 3 different planes for each combatant air force (for a total of 9 aircraft), but I had hoped to fly a few Army Air Force fighters as well. So far I have seen only one Army plane that is player-flyable, and that's the P-38 Lightning.  I would have liked to fly the P-40 (maybe in a Pearl Harbor introductory game) and the P-51D on escort duty over Japan.  Still, I understand that game design often involves compromises to enable different computers with different capabilities to run this kind of software, so this gripe is not a major one that should deter you from buying this game.",Hell in the Pacific Skies -- CFS2 Soars High!,1055635200,5,,

Call of Duty 2, by following the formula of the original and offering numerous improvements, might actually be a better game overall. First, the graphics have gotten a much needed update. While the original Call of Duty is nice, COD2 is pure eye candy. Little details in the graphics make all the difference -- the smoke is incredibly realistic, the models look far better, and the weapons are much higher definition and have a more realistic feel to them. Second, the sound is drastically improved. The battle chatter is great, especially in the British campaigns. Bullets whiz, mortars boom, and anti-aircraft fire rattles away. It truly is an immersive experience. Third, the level detail and layout is much better than the original Call of Duty. The mission selection menu is great. You switch between the Russian and British campaigns and wind up closing down the game with the Americans. While each campaign has great levels, some of the best are the initial British fights against the Desert Fox in northern Africa and the American battle at Point Du Hoc. Taking the beach there is incredibly -- even better than Stalingrad in the original Call of Duty -- but the best part is the second mission where you have to hold the beach against a Germany counter offensive. You end up getting beaten back all the way to the ocean before your reinforcements arrive.

Although some other reviewers have noted the short length of the game, I found it perfectly fine. A first I was afraid that I would beat the game in short order, but it ended up taking over a month with average game play per week around seven to eight hours. I highly recommend setting the difficulty setting on at least ""hardened."" That will definitely make the game a more enjoyable experience and lengthen it for you. If you're beating the missions in ten minutes, that's probably because the difficulty is too low for your skill level.

My one gripe is the system requirements. While they are not too bad, you need a very nice machine to run this game in all of its glory. I have a Pentium 2.8Ghz, 1.5GB of ram, GeForce 6800GT graphics card, and could run the game with most of the special affects turned down but the detail turned all the way up at a decent resolution without much lag. But still, the original Call of Duty would run seamlessly on my system, even though there is a noticeable difference in the graphics quality. COD2 was definitely designed for the latest graphics cards, so be warned. Unless you're into high resolutions and all the bells and whistles, though, your system should run it OK.

I'm glad to see the price for COD2 has really come down. You can get a used copy for around $10 here. Not bad at all. Definitely recommended.",Improvement over the original,1178236800,3,,

""Sims 2"" is a massive improvement over the original game.

On the Disco rink, the puck is mirror-ball. It's hilarious! When you look at the Goalie, is padding is spectacular. With Phenomenal 3D enriched environment, NHL Hitz gets a 10/10 for graphics. And don't forget the jerseys, all of them have the logo on them.
There's not much to say about the sound. You just hear the clashing of sticks, the stick breaking the sound barrier, and the crowd cheering (or booing!) at players.  The announcers aren't that spectacular. Unlike Madden, where the commentators explain about what's going on, what's happened last season, what they should do, and reaction to plays, NHL Hitz has people who say ""[Insert name of player here] just took a shot!"" ""Blocked by [Insert name of player here]"" ""Puck stolen from [Insert name of player here] by [Insert name of player here]."" It's rather boring, so I think I can safely sleep at night without felling too bad by giving the sound an 8.5/10
Now, when I say speed, I don't mean how fast Wayne Gretzky and glide down the rink, I mean loading time. Again, contrary to madden, the loading time is exceptionally fast. The only tiny problem is it takes about a quarter of a second for the players faces to load when selecting your team. What's even better, is you can set the speed of the game! If things are too fast for you on the ice, just crank down the speed a notch. Call me crazy, but Speed gets an 11/10.
Controlling the players is no fun. It's watching the expression on your friends face and you juke his opponent, fake shot and pass it, move the puck to the side of you as he attempts to stick slap you, watch your CPU character bash him out of the rink, breaking the glass, and doing a slap-shot right into the net as you win the game. Now, do you know how hard that scenario would be? You don't, BECAUSE IT'S NOT! Look, to do this, I would press Y, X, Hold B and press A, the CPU would ""press"" y, and then I would Hold B to my liking to choose how hard I should hit it. The longer you hold, the harder you hit. With simple controls like A to pass, B to shoot, X to guard puck, and Y to spin, and on defense, a to switch players, B to stick-slap and attempt to steal, Y to do a check, and X to do... well I don't think it does anything. Then by pressing R or L to go into the Patented ""Turbo"" mode, the controlling makes the grade with a 10/10.
Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Hockey game and play it once. All sport games have to get a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, obviously, NHL Hitz 20-02 gets a 10/10 for Replay.
Without a doubt, if you ever feel like a Hockey game, just pick up NHL Hitz.
Let's review:
Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics: 10/10
Sound: 8.5/10
Speed: 11/10
Controls: 10/10
Replay value: 10/10
Total: 59.5/60 giving NHL Hitz 20-02 a 99.16.
CHEATS
Well, like most Midway Sports games, there's that thing where you select a variety of 3 pictures, then press up/down/left/right. NHL has that, and the codes are great. There's Snow mode, Big head mode, and first person to 7 wins mode. With no generosity, I'll give it a +2 for codes, because it's hard to enter more than one code at once, and sometimes you can't even enter one.
NHL Hitz 20-02's new score is  an 101.16. MY FIRST GRADE OVER 100! Now even I know it's good!",Bone-crunching stick-smashing punch-throwing action 4 Gcube,1019865600,3,,
5.0,False,"02 14, 2014",A1NPKJEGUUVAHS,B00BMFIXKQ,E. Kellogg,"First I would like to say that while I have played and enjoyed the assassins creed games I have never been amazed by them in the way that some people have been, however that changed entirely with this game. There were so many things that I loved and a few things that I really hated as well.

After turning on the game and starting to play, the first thing that hit me was how beautiful the world was. You can certainly tell that the creators spent a great deal of time making sure the world looked flat out incredible. It was a nice breath of fresh air from so many other games where the worlds looked alright but not really stunning by any means. I also liked the huge amount of collectibles incorporated in this game, not just in the cities but also on random islands in the middle of the ocean. It added many extra hours of exploring and game play onto the game as well as quite a bit more satisfaction having collected every treasure chest, animus piece, floating bottle, and treasure map. Which brings me to another thing that I thought was really creative; the use of treasure maps. Throughout the world, you have the opportunity to find treasure maps that give you a picture and a set of coordinates. You then have to sail to the coordinates and based on the picture, find and dig up a treasure usually containing a plan to upgrade your ship or a couple thousand reales. Just like the collectibles, it just added a couple more hours of exploring and greater satisfaction having found them all. (some of which are exceptionally hard to find)

The game play itself is also very satisfying. One thing I was worried about prior to this game coming out was how important the pirate theme would end up being. I wasn't sure if it was only a minimal part of the story, however I can tell you that the pirate theme is a major part of the story. not just a gimmick by ubisoft. You are actually able to upgrade your pirate ship to be more powerful, then attack other ships to gain supplies. You are also able to form your own entire fleet of ships to trade with various colonies to gain extra money. This kept my attention for a very long time.

 Overall the movements seemed very lifelike and I found it pretty easy to fight. One thing that I have never been a fan of in the assassins creed games, is the universal action button. I always found it to be tricky to use in certain situations, such as when you are trying to chase a target or avoid being detected and this game is no different. the universal action button, while a good thought in theory and 95% of the time, the other 5% of the time can be a real pain.

The main story was slightly more involved than previous AC games, however not as much as I would like to have seen in this game. In all honesty, I probably only spent 15-20 hours on the main story which helped to explain alot of the backstory of the Kenways. However in this game you are never actually an assassin or templar, you are simply a pirate who happened to stumble upon the legend of the observatory. Towards the end you start working with the assassins, however that is one of the last parts of the game. In that regard I would have liked it to be more like the prior assassins creed games but I was still captivated by the idea of being a pirate so it did not matter much to me.

The last thing that I wanted to talk about was the game play app that is available for apple and android products. I was worried that this might be a small failure on ubisofts part because it is such a new concept in the gaming world, however I was proven wrong yet again! I downloaded the app and had it open on my ipad while I was playing which made it so much easier to see where you are in conjunction with whatever it is that you are heading towards. It also made it extremely easy to find treasure without having to open up the map every time you needed to look at the picture again. The best thing about it (in my opinion) is that you are able to control your fleet from the app. So even when you are not able to play the game, you can still open up the app on your ipad, iphone, or android phone and you will still be able to send your ships to trade and keep making money which is a huge plus in my mind.

Overall, this is by far my favorite assassins creed game to date, the stunningly beautiful world coupled with the massive amounts of collectibles and normal gameplay, you will be entertained for weeks. the only things I would say need to be better would be the universal action button as well as a more immersive storyline however Overall, I think this is a 5 star game.",A little different than I expected but still an Incredible game,1392336000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

But its definitely not a bad thing, RE4 was one of the best games of its time and almost all of its weakness have been improved or fixed in Resident Evil 5. The over the shoulder 3rd person perspective will also be familiar. It is different from most shooters and takes some adjustments. But once you adapt to it you will find a good amount of control and precision to be had. There are frustrations and some of the bosses can be quite annoying, but you feel as if you have accomplished something when you finally beat a particularly difficult fight.

You will do more shooting in RE5 than past games, but ammo usage and inventory are as important as ever. The graphics are simply amazing, though much of the blood and gore are a bit over the top at times. The AI for enemies is good, though in single player the AI for your partner suffers at times. Often times she will stand in front of enemy fire and she isn't once to conserve ammunition. That said she does a good job of watching your back. Some players will except the limitations and enjoy while others will use her more as a pack mule and carefully control her inventory. The whole problem is easily resolved when playing with another human in coop mode. Which is where the game really starts to shine. Granted a portion of the ambiance and fear created in the series to date has been the feeling of being utterly alone, which you won't get in this game. But the ability to share in the terror with another player doesn't necessarily lessen it, it just makes it different.

I don't think RE5 is a ground breaking entry into the series, but it is a refinement of everything that was good with the last one.

Unfortunately, its 2011 sequel does not live up to expectations. And this is all the opening the perfect sequel needed to come in and, once more, steal the show.

THIS IS HOW TO MAKE A cRPG SEQUEL!
Although there may be Xbox and PS3 versions of this game later on, this is a game designed from start to finish for the PC. In an age when 5-6 years old consoles set the standard this is very important. From the brand new engine to the very last script line, everything that could be worked on was and everything that could be improved shows improvement.  The story is now even deeper; the graphics are several notches higher; character development has been both streamlined and more balanced; equipping Geralt is now more detailed whereas loot is abundant.
It is possible (although not necessary) to import your character from the first WITCHER. If, like me, you liked the original game, you will simply love the sequel.

LOOK AT THE SKY: IT IS THE WITCHING HOUR - EVERY HOUR!
The graphics are simply A-MA-ZING! I like the way the rock formations catch the moving shadows and how the wind stirs up dust. I like the subtle movement of the grass and the exploding colors of the wild flowers. I like the textures of the clothes, the shine of the armor and the glint of the swords. I like the way the sun gets in your eyes and the way rays of light play with the tree foliage.
What is also important, these graphics and dynamic lighting are achieved even on medium-built systems (Minimum specs: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz/AMD 2.5GHz, nVidia 8800/ATI 3850, 1GB of RAM for WinXP/ 2GB for WinVISTA&7).
Even more impressively, the game is set in a day/night cycle, and this is reflected not only on the levels of ambient light but also on the activities of the surrounding world.

THE WORLD AROUND YOU COMES TRULY ALIVE
Remember how in most RolePlaying games approaching a Non-Playing Character (NPC) usually means he or she would utter any one of a small number of preset phrases? After a while, you have heard them all and it got very predictable. Well, prepare to be surprised. Again and again.
This is a world you will truly be immersed into. A world that wakes up, goes to work, gossips, bickers and barters, and unwinds in the tavern. Walk the same streets at night and they are eerily empty. And that is without taking into account the ever changing weather!
The immersion is so total for yet two other reasons: not only is the world fully open from the very beginning (no blocked areas or closed bridges!) but there are no loading delays between areas (only between chapters).

THE LIFE OF A WITCHER IS NEVER BORING
Geralt is a real warlock, combining a mix of sword fighting with potions and spells. These are the three main character developing trees, Swordmaster, Alchemist or Mage. Sword moves, potion ingredients and spells can be combined - and all choices are meticulously balanced.
With the original WITCHER it took me a while to master the timed sword-strokes - but it was really satisfying after that. In the sequel, sword-fighting has been simplified to the classic mod - and that is one of the gripes I have with this game. The other is the short dialogue options. I like my cRPGs wordy.
Now, the story is far from being linear. Choices matter and choosing a path will bifurcate the story, most of the times irrevocably. And the story in WITCHER 2 is as important as the fighting.
What I also appreciated was the return of consequences. Those of you who have played BALDUR's GATE Saga know that bashing or picking the lock of a chest was a punishable offense if anyone saw you. In contrast, in DA-O you could rob the town blind and (quite unrealistically) the NPCs could not care less. Well, in this game, your character better behave or face the ever vigilant guards.

ADJUSTED TO OUR ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF BINDING
Most retail versions of the game came with a simple disc-check, implemented by SecuROM. If you own FALLOUT 3, for example, you have experienced the same thing. Compared to the customer-abusing schemes out there (UBISOFT's and 2K GAMES' ears should be burning at this point) I found this solution not ideal but palatable. However, it gets better, much better.
The game is now DRM-FREE because all traces of SecuROM have been patched out by the developers themselves from day one. They chose to face ATARI's lawsuits in order to show their customers respect. Now only the STEAM version has DRM.THE WITCHER 2 gets full marks in my books in this aspect as well!
Just for listening to its customers and doing this CD PROJEKT earned a permanent place of honor in gaming history.

A FINAL SPELL
I have only praises for this magnificent sequel to a great game. It was one of the rare cases when I pre-ordered a game before I knew anything about it and was rewarded with a game that exceeded my highest expectations.  I do have some advice for the game developers though.
First, keep showing the same respect to your customers and you will see that gamers know how to repay this with equal respect and loyalty. And finally, when the mega-publishers show up at your door with their mesmerizing bags of money, try to remember what happened to so many great game developing groups in the past that did not resist to temptation.

The game will get a complete overhaul in April when the Enhanced edition will be released. However, because CD PROJEKT is a gamer's company (and not some greedy multinational), as owners of the original edition we will be able to download the Enhanced edition Patch from the official website - for free. As are all the DLCs by the way!

5.0,False,"04 8, 2004",AHQKZEBZKY1YF,B00008YMZV,Thomas Simpson,"Advance Wars 1 was a massive sleeper hit.  You wouldn't think that the Gameboy Advance would be condusive to making a strategy game, but Advance Wars 1 & 2 proves that wrong.
Of all the games I own, this and WarioWare are the only two that still get near daily or weekly play well over a year after their release.  Advance Wars contains an insane amount of replay value.  After beating the single player campaign you can unlock the Hard campaign.  In some cases the Hard campaign is just the same maps from the regular game with more enemy units, in other cases it's a completely new map.
If that's not enough, as you play you gain coins you can use to buy battle maps.  You can play a battle map against a specific foe, tuned to that map, or load up a Vs. map and play against anyone you'd like on any map.  Over 150 maps you can unlock.  And you can even create your own maps!
This game has great multiplayer too.  You can play with just one cartridge and two gameboys with a link cable, although you're limited to small maps.  If everyone has Advance Wars you can play any map with the cable that you've unlocked.  However that wasn't enough for these guys, and they made a single gameboy multiplayer mode too!  So you and a buddy can play (easiest to set it to fog of war, but you have control over all aspects of the game rules) and just pass the gameboy back and forth.
The simple fact is that this is one of the best games ever made for the gameboy.  There's so many maps to play, the two main campaigns, and each game is different based on which CO you have commanding your forces.  The fact I'm still playing this long after its release, is a testament to it's value.

Love this franchise.

This port to the Vita is amazing. Sure there are some differences like graphics - but this is a portable system and the graphics are amazing on this port. The game stays true to the original in game play and story. There seem to be less enemies per map though, understandably.

The guns and gore are still there and their sense of humor, o the sense of humor.

If you were a fan of the console or PC version, or even if you haven't tried this game out yet - for $20 (which nets you 6 DLCs along with the original game) - you can't go wrong.

The only thing I don't get is why would a game say how many megabytes per second is being used to install games when it's on a disc. I have played Infinite Warfare maybe 10 minutes and I wasn't thrilled. So my review is on Modern Warfare. I played Modern Warfare when it was released on 360 and I loved it so I had to purchase garbage just to play Modern Warfare. Maybe that's why Battlefield is going back instead of moving forward in Battlefield 1 because they know what fans want. You can now play multiplayer with bots on Modern Warfare when the 360 version didn't have that option. I never cared about the zombies games in the Call of Duty franchise because of having doing the easter eggs and 50 other things at once while trying to get away and shoot the zombies. I only liked the campaigns and multiplayer.

5.0,True,"05 1, 2009",A3IC46QHBMPKJB,B0018YXM3Y,Devin D. Bass,"If your not familair with the series, this a hybrid game, turn based on the global map and real-time during land and naval battles.  The game is semi-historical in that you play the actual empires of that period while dealing with the unique issues that they dealt with.  You goal is to conquer a certain number of regions or gain a certain number of prestiege points.  The time period is 1700-1799.  The game graphics are incrediable, but to get the most out of the graphics I suggest a beefy rig.  Your playing field is Europe to Americas to India.  This is epic game play!  If you are a gamer who wants to play something real quick after work to blow out some stress, then I suggest you get a PS3 or 360 game.  This is hard core strategy and it will take days if not weeks depending on your play style to finish a campaign ( and keep in mind that is with just one nation, you can try the others for a complete different set of experiences)

I enjoy the empire building and battles and I usually ignore the diplomacy and espionage side of games, but in this game diplomacy is key to victory!  You just can't build tons of armies and move them all over the place, you need to secure your borders with diplomacy while your limited armies and generals are fighting somewhere else.  Also this game does a great job of making you not treat your units like fodder.  Units cost a lot.  So getting a whole army destroyed will hurt, hurt real bad.
So this makes you approach battles with caution (as it should be) Your unit also get veteran status as they get combat experience, this experience is critical (kind of takes on a role playing aspect)so you want your good units and generals to survive.

They recently released a major patch (4/29/09) it fixes all the release bugs and improves some other things.  The AI still needs some additional fine tuning but it is more than a challenge.  Put it on Hard/Hard that feels about right.  I think when the next patch comes out in about 6 weeks or so this could be the finest strategy game ever produced.  And I own A LOT OF STRATEGY GAMES.

One that I'd probably end up getting because Rare made it. Then I saw the first set of trailers for it on IGN. Boy, was I shocked. Blood galore. Violence at every corner. It was actually funny. Singing poop. And language that would make a sailor smile. This wasn't another Rare kid's game. I don't remember how, but I ended up with several copies of the game. Afterwards, I sold some of the ""still packaged"" games to Special FX (Waco's finest game trading place) who gave me enough to buy a ton of new games. I beat it over a friend's house and was almost tear jerked because I wanted to find out what happened to a host of the characters. You'd understand if you played it.

Conker is now redone. Reloaded as they say. It has much better graphics. For instance, Conker actually has fur instead of a decent polygonal orange... red... surface. The sound quality is a ton better. Best of all, the game host a few new surprises from the original. The game is just hysterical, even after all these years. The Matrix scene is awesome. The Gladiator rips are to die for. The Saving Private Ryan parody is just the apple in the pie. It's all a riot for not only the player, but friends watching. The graphics and sounds in this remake have been so well redone, it's literally like playing a new game.

The game has a host of new options too, some which I wish all games had. For one, there's a profanity filter. I prefer to play my games with one on because I just don't like to hear certain words flowing out of anythings mouth. Although, even with the profanity unlocked, you won't hear any F-bombs or anything. Another new feature I liked was the multiplayer. Then again, I also hated it. The original multiplayer was more of a mini-game style. It really didn't last too long, but it was fun sometimes. The best modes being the military modes and the heist, as well as raptors vs. cavemen. However, the new multiplayer is a lot more lasting, even to include stats and a nice ranking system. I just wish they could have kept the originals in there for kicks.

It's easy to pick up and hard to put down. I grew up playing some fighting games in arcade yet never got enough play time with them to get used to the controls, so I grew up playing fighting games with a controller. My issue with playing fighting games on the controller was that I had a hard time inputting in certain combo's especially some of the moving / stance combo's. My character would always jump or simply just crouch instead of moving around the opponent. This stick allows you to input moves a lot better and helps dishing out some pretty sick combos
I've seen a lot of reviews on this with PC controls yet never any reviews with actual console. If you are getting this for PS2 / PS3 it is simply a plug and play fight stick. Just plug it in and start playing. I had to read the box to figure out what the controls were for certain games. Yet after that I got used to it.

It is filled with over the top action scenes that you create on the fly (for the most part), mysterious characters, love interests, betrayal, obvious enemies, exploring exotic lands...  It has so much more depth than the typical action game where you run around shooting enemies or the platform/adventure game filled with jumping on platforms and solving puzzles.  It's the blend of all these things together that create the feeling of living the adventure without actually feeling bullet wounds, falling and getting hurt, and surviving countless explosions.  The character and environment rendering makes the game feel extremely realistic.  The havok physics engine gives the player the feeling that the environments contain tangible objects.  While the lighting and color saturation in the game may seem over the top, it only adds to the flavor and feel of the game.

Usually, sequels to classic games (like Uncharted: Drake's Fortune) can't live up to trying to take the original game to the next level.  This is one of those rare games that people will remember years from now as joining the fraternity of rare games that have achieved this goal.  This game is the same length as the original game at about 15 hours to complete which makes it accessible to casual gamers who don't have time to spend hours and hours playing a video game.  Every time I stopped playing the game, it felt like I had paused a movie where I played the lead role and simply resumed it at a later time.

The advertisement for this game on TV is true to many experiences gamers have had with their friends, family, and loved ones watching them play this game.  They also become immersed in the story wanting to find out what happens next.  I remember when my cousins came to visit me, we all watched as one of them played through the first Uncharted game.  At this point, I had probably played through the original game more than six times.  It's the same great story every time, but the action is so dynamic the game never plays out the same way twice.  The only thing I'd add to this game is to have each of the main voice actors describe one of the locations in detail in a brief documentary video.  I would love to learn more about Turkey, Borneo, and Nepal.

I have played the multiplayer beta (death match, capturing zones, co-op treasure hunting) and it is just as good and exciting as the single player game in the online world.  I haven't delved into multiplayer in the real game yet, but I plan to jump in when I'm not replaying the single player game again.

I suppose I have become a casual video game player as this is one of the few PS3 games I've purchased this year.  I'm getting busier with life in general, but there is always time to create an adventure that you couldn't live in real life.  The adrenaline rush in this game is similar to the one I get from rock climbing, riding my motorcycle, shooting guns at the firing range, and driving sports cars.

Highly recommended for all PS3 owners with a sense of adventure.",live the action/adventure of a lifetime,1255737600,,,

I was very borderline on this series after playing the other games (although I loved Planescape: Torment, which doesn't really fit in), so I almost never bought BG2.  I am very happy that I did.  This game is great.
This game is drastically improved over BG1.  Path-finding is better.  It is rare that your characters wander off aimlessly now (it still happens every once in a while though).  Tons of weapons, spells, and other goodies have been added.  Some of them are redundant, but many of them add new functions, like spell absorption and reflection.  The inventory system isn't tedious anymore - this is due to automatic stacking of items, and the addition of gem bags and scroll cases.  The in-game maps have flags on them now with the important areas, so that you won't have to remember where they are.  The shops are stocked with much better stuff, but their markup is higher - basically, it is harder to make money, but there is more to spend it on.  Best of all, the frustration level of this game is much lower!  A lot less of the ""reload after getting bushwhacked and ripped to pieces"" routine.  This is not to say that Shadows of Amn is an easy game.  It is still very, very tough.  Your party will get killed here and there, but not as often.  There are many other small additions that have improved the quality of this game.
Don't worry, Baldurs Gate 2 has everything that was good about the previous installments in this series.  The graphics and animation, especially the spell effects, are excellent.  The music is superb once again.
The game throws a multitude of quests at you - large and small.  The ""Shadows of Amn"" world is huge.  There are so many areas, each one rich and unique.  Incredible attention to detail breathes life into every map.  I am trying to imagine how many man-hours went into this game.
But here's my major beef with the game.  You only get to generate one character yourself.  All of the character and class variety built into this game is squandered - you only get to pick one out of many.  What makes this worse is that the selection of NPC's that offer to join you is way too small.  Most of them don't match what you're looking for.  What's the point of having all of these funky character classes if you don't get to experiment with them?
To me, the other cons for this game come largely from the D&D system itself.  It was made for the tabletop to be played in turns, and it doesn't translate well into a computer game.  The system of having to pick a few spells and rest so that you can memorize them takes a lot away from this (or any other D&D) game.  So does the lack of importance placed upon intellectual traits.  Memorizing the right spells for a specific encounter sometimes makes the difference of whether you will survive it - the problem is, you don't know when these encounters will come until you have already died and reloaded your saved game once.
Fallout and Arcanum are a couple of games that I can think of which have a better overall role-playing and combat system.  If you are looking for an excellent role-playing experience (which doesn't necessarily have great graphics or sound effects) then pick up one of those games too.
Regardless, this game is excellent (and, yes, addictive!)  If you haven't played any game in this series yet, then you should seriously consider picking this one up.  Baldurs Gate 2 is a great, long-lasting game.",Bravo!  They got this one right,1018396800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

If you like games like Half Life:  Team Fortress or SWAT 3, you will like CS, yet another teamwork based game.  The graphics are good and the sound is great, and the control is perfect as long as you get on a nearly lag-free server.
In fact, my only major gripes with CS, have nothing to do with the actual software.  1.  The ""team"" you play with only works when the other players cooperate, all too often, your teammates are just a bunch of Rambos who leave you all alone pinned down by a sniper and a guy with a shotgun! 2.  The game gets extremely hard to play when the server you are on can't handle 8 player playing in the room, you get such a lag, it can take up to 20 seconds for your guy to finish with his last shot and slap in a new mag!  A good sever can handle 32 players with very little lag. 3.  This is the software;  you shoot a guy point blank with a shoygun in the face, and he lives because he is wearing body armor...  BODY ARMOR, not face armor! 4.  You can have radio conversations with teammates, but all too often, you end up calling for backup from your TEAM, and nobody comes to help, in fact, you get some smart guys that actually reply over the radio, ""Negative.""
Luckily, I host games were I am a CT, (Couter-terrorist), squad leader and my friend leads the Terrorists, and if people get a little too independant or come in and lag our game too much, I can boot them.  With CS, you can get into a clan and have some teammates that will stay with you , my clan is pretty good.

While mostly I play golf, baseball or puzzles games every now and then I like to try out something new. I found this game to be both fun and a great break from the everyday grind.

The install was easy as I started with cd1 and answering a few questions and before I knew it the installation was complete. I was able to get Windows 98, ME, 200 and XP to work. The game calls for a 32MB video card and I would say this is a minimum, I would also recommend a video card with 3D acceleration.

Also the hard space required is 1.5GB and I would recommend 3GB. There are several different rallys and each one has a different set of obstacles and events that can occur. I was able to play the game with the keyboard and mouse, but the gamepad or sidewinder wheel would certainly enhance the game play.

The graphics are great and with a P4 processor you have very little lag in the refresh and the game runs very smoothly. I only had one game failure and that was under Windows ME, the other versions had no failures and the game played for over 3 hours at a time.

This game takes place before the events of New Order.  It is broken in to two parts (Part 1: Rudi Jger and the Den of Wolves, Part 2: The Dark Secrets of Helga Von Schabbs).  There are a few new weapons and a fun new climbing mechanic facilitated by a steel pipe, but, for the most part if you played New Order you know what you are getting in to with Old Blood.  And that is a good thing because both of these games are a lot of fun to play.

The Old Blood is a throwback to classic First-Person shooters.  There are some modern FPS elements like a very basic cover system, stealth, the ability to lean around corners to fire at enemies, etc. but at its core it feels like what the original Wolfenstein 3D would have been had modern hardware / engines been around when they made it.  There are no limits to how many guns you can carry.  Running in to a room full blast with guns blazing is often a totally legitimate strategy.  And you can dual-wield two impossibly large automatic shotguns that fill a large portion of your screen for maximum carnage (spoiler alert: dual-wielding automatic shotguns is extremely satisfying).

There are some sections that I found slightly monotonous due to the fact that I don't love stealth sequences where you have to wait around for some large baddie to turn his back, run to the next area of cover and repeat.  The mechanic that forces you to do that frequently are large electric soldiers where you have to sneak to their power source, turn it off, then take them out up close and personal with your steel pipe while making sure the baddie in the next room doesn't see you.  But, I can take stealth sections in small doses and it doesn't get out of control.

The plot isn't as rich or deep as The New Order (which had a surprisingly compelling story line) and leans on the assumption that people playing this will have played The New Order and thus already be a bit invested in Blazkowicz's character.  It is stand-alone and you don't have to play The New Order to get what's going on here, but, I would suggest that you do for maximum enjoyment.

Both of the new Wolfenstein games have some surprisingly dark/gory content.  I guess that shouldn't surprise me given that we are dealing with Nazis but I wasn't expecting it due to the fact that the game doesn't take itself seriously in other ways (watch the trailer for The Old Blood and it is super campy).  I can't play this while my girlfriend is watching because it is too much for her even though I am like ""but I HAD to repeatedly stab that dog.  It was an evil Nazi dog!"".  You have been warned.

In summary, if you played The New Order and liked it this expansion is a no-brainer (New Order pun alert!).  If not, you are in for some enjoyable retro FPS action.",More of the same - and that's a very good thing...,1430956800,31,{'Platform:': ' PS4 Digital Code'},

I am a fan of Naruto though, and I have played other Naruto games, most notably the Uzamaki Chronicles series. That being said, this is an excellent game in terms of graphics, variety, depth and fun factor. The game has at least 40 playable characters, once you unlock them all and it took me about two weeks to do that. I play about three hours a day after work, and I am not all that experienced with the fighting games, so I'm sure experienced gamers would take less time. The Heroes history (my favorite) game goes with the storyline up to the Sasuke retrieval arc and that is a definite plus. The cut scene videos are excellent in sound quality, content and timing. That made the game very entertaining for me.

You can unlock music tracks, cards and figurines along the way and the Ultimate contest is fun too. You get to walk around and beat everybody up along the way sort of battle royale style, and take their crystals. Good stuff. I love the secret technique summoning jutsus in this one. You can also customize your character if you want as you unlock techniques.

I have been dumb enough to periodically waste money on some of the various third person games out there like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, but I hate third person and cannot get into it at all. Might & Magic does not have that problem.

This game, along with MM-6 and MM-8 are pretty much in the same format with a few tweaks. That is fine with me. I have become so engrossed it them that I have played all three of them at least three times each. There is no other game that even comes close.

Despite the crudeness factor, I love the graphics. The spell system is just right, and I don't mind all the monster bashing. The story kept me engaged each time I played, even knowing the outcome the second and third time around.

I just wish someone would continue the series in the same format with maybe 3-D graphics but the same game play and all the rest. I give a hats off to the Might & Magic Tribute people who are doing it on their own, since no company seems interested in doing it.

But when we come to the Nintendo 64 controller, we find something completely different. The designers seem to have gotten the shape just right so that your hands can fit comfortably in the best position to play games, with each button placed at the most convenient places so you don't have to reach for them.

The first time playing through this game had me on the edge of my seat, ready to throw the controller down and run out of the room if I had to.

I loved it!  It's kind of along the same lines as the TellTale games where you mold the game to your choices as you go.  Certain choices can result in something good happening, and others can result in something bad, even death.  It seems like there is a little more variation to the outcome of this game as opposed to the TellTale games where it's more or less an illusion of choice.  The game itself is linear in the events that happen, but whether the characters live or die is up to the survival skills of the player, or whether or not you choose to screw someone over.  How much people like you, is really up to the player too because you can be nice or you can be mean.

I was really impressed with the graphics and the acting.  I didn't realize Rami Malek was in the game until he showed up on screen.  It was a nice surprise because I've loved that guy since the first Night at the Museum (or maybe The Pacific).  The rest of the acting is really great too.  If you were to look up the actors on IMDB, they pretty much look exactly like their Until Dawn counterparts.

Be prepared for jump scares coming at you right and left, there are dozens of them throughout the game.

The only thing I didn't care for was that you can't have multiple save files at one time.  You can go back and replay episodes to change the events, or replay the entire game if you want, but as far as I can tell, there isn't a way to have 2 separate games going at once.  I may not necessarily want to lose what happened in the first game, but I might want to play through again and be mean to everybody.

GOOD:
- A third person shooting and cover system similar to that of Gears of War or Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2 which is really a unique way to play a RPG. The Cover systems works well it also makes for a fun as well as a more realistic gameplay experience. While this system has its share of problems (its not as easy or streamline as Gears of War) it works well enough not to be a concern and bring something new to RPGs.
- A well thought out and well played story that rivals or bests that of Elder Scrolls, Resident Evil or any Final Fantasy game. The story itself is it told through dialog between yours and other characters, because of the choices of make during the story it has a ""choose your own adventure"" feel to it.
- Gorgeous graphics and nice animations, that look just as good as games like Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Assassins Creed.
- A great sound track that has the movie like quality of some of the great Sci-Fi Space movies from the past twenty years like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and Dune.

BAD:
- The learning curve is steep in this game and you will spend the first few hours learning how to play this game well. Although gamers who are use to playing First/Third Person Shooters (like Bioshock and Ghost Recon: Advance Warfighter) may find it easier to play (they should start the game on hard). Gamers who like playing turn based RPGs (like Final Fantasy X and Blue Dragon) will have a hard time adjusting (they should play the game on normal or easy).
- Most side quest planets can be barren with little to do outside of the quest you came for and a scant few other item pickups scattered around, plus many structures/buildings you enter during these side missions are almost exactly the same.
- The inventory system that you use keep track of items as well as equip items on your character is not very streamline and can be annoying due to the fact that there is no way to organize your inventory in any real order and keeping track of more then a few items becomes something of a chore.
- This game has a more then a few loading sequences during gameplay that might upset impatient gamers.

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- The story of the game is mostly told through dialogs between yourself and other characters in the game, it should really be noted that your choices in responding to questions asked of you and your reactions to events unfolding around you is going to change the story of the game and attitudes of others around you. It should also be noted that during the games story you can make choices that either make your character into a brash loose cannon who cheats, steals and shoots first asks questions later or a by the book fighter or justice and freedom with moral values and willing to sacrifice personal wants for the good of others.
- A Sci-Fi RPG with lots of Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player) elements. The games combat has quicker pacing then most RPGs like Final Fantasy XII or even Fable, although the over all combat is slower then more main stream First/Third Person Shooters like Halo or Lost Planet, the shooting aspect has an emphasis on shooting behind cover as well similar to games like Gears of War and Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2.
- You start will all the gun types your ever going to get in the game (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle) you can of course get newer versions of these guns and later even add mods to modify the effects and stats of each gun type. Although the effectiveness of each gun type is really depends on your skill with that gun type (you upgrade your gun skills at your stat screen), you can of course use guns you have no training for which will result in much less effectiveness of using that gun type, so it would be wise to always try to use guns types your character class can (will be able to) upgrade. Note: Solider class is proficient in all gun types (can upgraded in all gun types).
- This game has lots of dialog/story, which plays a very big role in this game, which in turn will turn off gamers looking for fast paced action with little interruption.
- No multiplayer or online gameplay.
- Travel to many different worlds/solar systems through out the Milky Way galaxy (the galaxy you currently live in) with your own star ship the Normandy and its crew. During your missions you get to bring two of six other characters with you and these other characters (all six of them) can have their stats as well as equipment be chosen by you.

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Xbox/PC)
- Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2 (360/PS3)
- Jade Empire (Xbox/PC)
- Gears of War (360/PC)
- Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (360/PS3/PC)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- To get all of this game's achievements your going to have to beat this game at least three time. You get an achievement for beating the game once as well as twice but to unlock the ""Insanity"" difficultly (which after beating the game on this difficultly you also get an achievement) your going to have to beat the game on Hard then Hardcore just to unlock that difficultly.
- In the limited collector's edition you will find an art and background story book ""Galactic Codex"" as well as a bonus DVD with the videos ""The Making of Mass Effect"" documentary /music (from the game)/360 dashboard themes and it all comes in a tin case.
- There is already a novel out called Mass Effect: Revelation, which has lots of background story for the game as well as the background for the characters you meet in the game Anderson and Saren.
- There is talk from Bioware about downloadable content coming on the way for Mass Effect.",The Galaxy Beckons,1197331200,28,,

A lot of similarities of GTA but better graphics & quality. Get to do a lot more stuff than what you could do in GTA.
Besides the fact this game makes GTA look bad plus with a twist.

Reminds me a lot of Infamous Second Son. But here your a hacker going after a guy that put a hit on you that killed your niece.
In Infamous Second Son, you go after the bitch that hurts your tribe to gain her powers by killing her or expose her after what she did to Reggie & the Tribe, what she is really doing by keeping her kind safe in cages, either that or they probably would've killed her.

Driving 9/10
Really like the driving in this game except for some of the hard turns you gotta pull off by pressing circle but to me its easy, just got to time it when to do it and how much, to much or to less with to early or to late will impact your speed and get away.

Wreckage 6/10
While driving, getting into a mess by damaging the car should have a little more realistic type of damage depending what car you use and what you hit impacts to the car. Besides the fact you are the hacker and you have better driving skills but doesn't include what car you drive thou.

-Havent bought my own car since gianing a lot of cash, at 5mill now, I wonder if we could upgrade our parts too to make it a bad ass with some paint spray, fast speeds after take off from 0 with less amount of friction. if so, tats a straight 10/10. if not but somewhat to it, then i give it about a 7-8/10

-Do love the add-ons by upgrading the wheels but that can be different from car to car that you don't own plus without going to a shop with it so that's a disadvantaged in it as well.

Graphics 8/10
are astounding but could be better with along of 4k-8k, hopefully there be an update for it plus the visual effects to it.

Can be hard at first comparing to from playing gta for 1st timers of watchdogs but after getting used to what to do on how to get away comes easier.

5.0,False,"11 15, 2011",A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B0050SZ49Y,Gaming.Fit,"Like many of you, I spent a lot of money for my LCD TV several years ago. When Sony announced their firmware update that allowed for 3D gaming and viewing of 3D Blu-Ray movies, I was tempted to buy another widescreen TV, but couldn't justify shelling out a few thousand more dollars for it. 3D would have to wait.

Sony did something clever with this product. They bundled a 24"" monitor with 3D glasses, the game Motorstorm Apocalypse, and an HDMI cable and priced it under $500. Suddenly it was a lot more affordable.

The monitor comes packaged in a large box with a carrying handle (another benefit of ordering a smaller TV is that you don't need a crew of people to carry it upstairs). There's a slight amount of assembly required, which is a snap (literally). You attach the monitor to the stand and the stand to the base. Then, you just plug it into AC (the power cord is only about 5 feet, which was a bit small for my needs), and then plug the HDMI cable from your PS3 to the unit.

It took me a while to find the power button, which is on the back of the unit to the right. There are six buttons in total: a power button, an input selector button (which switches between two HDMI connectors and one set of component (yPbPr) connectors), two volume buttons, a menu button, and a 3D button. They're all pretty generically shaped and lined up in one column, but to help you out an on-screen diagram will pop up when you press one to make sure you're pressing the right one. From the menu you can adjust the picture, including Backlight (0 to 10) and Picture Mode (dynamic, standard, cinema). You can also define a custom picture mode, setting your own brightness, contrast, color, hue, sharpness, and color temperature. It can be quite a pain to adjust menu settings with the buttons behind the unit, but you get used to it soon enough.

The PS3 recognized the monitor immediately. I was pleasantly surprised by the crispness of the display. The colors and clarity on the LED display were definitely deeper and crisper than my current LCD TV. Likewise, the sound was powerful (it has 2 channel stereo output at 3W and a subwoofer at 5W built in).

The 3D glasses come in a separate felt pouch, and the lenses come protected with some plastic over them (you pull off the plastic with convenient pull-tabs). It took me a while to figure out how to turn them on--there's a power switch on the inside for ""battery"" and then a separate power button on top, both of which need to be switched on. I was very happy to see a micro-USB connector on top (you need to pry open a little door to see it). I was afraid that like other Sony 3D glasses it'd be powered by a watch battery, but it looks like these glasses can be charged. Note that the connector is a smaller micro-USB connector and not a mini-USB such as the one used to charge the Dualshock and Move controllers. But happily there's a small USB-to-micro-USB cable included. I wear glasses, but the 3D glasses fit comfortably over them.

I popped in the game ""MLB: The Show 11"" to test it out. No 3D. I went to the menu options, and the 3D option was greyed out. I finally realized that I had to go to the PS3 menu under ""Settings"", and select Video Output Settings > HDMI > Auto and set the screen to 24 inches before 3D would be enabled. Once I did that I returned to the game where now I saw all kinds of new disclaimer screens I didn't see before referencing 3D.

Within the game, I adjusted the 3D settings. The first settings I tried had a lot of ghosting. But by adjusting the sliders a little I finally got a picture that was absolutely perfect. I wish that Sony had a ""universal"" setting instead of having us control it game-by-game, but bottom line, if the game developer did it right you will have control over the depth of 3D you can see.

Next, I tried a 3D Blu-Ray which I happened to get today in the mail, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. The disc started up and went right into 3D mode, with the opening menu gloriously popping out of the screen. It was a clean, crisp picture with no ghosting as far as I could tell. As is typical with these active 3D glasses, the picture was very dark even with the backlight set at maximum (it's like watching a TV screen with sunglasses). But if you sit close enough to the TV and/or adjust the menu settings, you should find a viewing setting that's comfortable.

Last, I tried connecting it to my laptop, which happens to have an HDMI output jack. To my delight, I was able to go to YouTube's 3D channel, play videos with the ""side by side"" viewing method, adjust the 3D mode of the TV, and see the videos in full 3D! Not surprisingly, the picture quality, resolution and color fidelity were excellent. I hadn't planned on it, but I will be most likely be making this my second computer monitor of choice.

The set does support ""SimulView"", which allows two people to play a game watching the same screen with both players seeing their own (2D) view of the game. I wasn't able to test because I didn't buy a second pair of glasses (which is kind of pricey at $70), but I'll update this review once I do.

To sum up, I was honestly a little afraid that at this price Sony might try to push a cheap TV on the masses. But everything about this set screams high quality, from the crisp picture, to the 176/176 viewing angle (meaning that multiple people can be between 2-8 feet from the screen and still see perfect 3D as long as they all have the 3D glasses), to the 5000:1 contrast ratio and 240 Hz refresh rate. Aesthetically, it's quite gorgeous too--the black, polished screen really looks distinctive, especially next to the sleek lines of the PS3 itself. And surprisingly, I put the 24"" TV next to my 42"" LCD and didn't really miss the fact too much that it was smaller (granted, I grew up watching a 25"" cathode ray tube TV).

The one possible caveat I'd have about this set is what I'd have about all 3D sets--there are some people who might experience some mild-to-severe nausea. For this reason, I'd recommend you play at a friend's house or spend a good couple of minutes in front of a store display to make sure you're not one of those who are affected. For me, I experienced a tiny bit of nausea, but I'll admit that the coolness factor definitely made up for it. Worst comes to worst, you can switch off the 3D and still have a very high quality LED display.

One other thing to note is that this isn't a ""TV"", as there's no TV tuner. But with the extra HDMI connector, you can easily plug in a TiVo or a cable box. Ironically, I also plugged in an Xbox 360 using the component cables, and that picture looks crisp as well.

Long story short, if you've been tempted to try out 3D, this makes an excellent entry-level display.

Unfortunately, I have to end my review with a couple words about Amazon. I have always been blown away by Amazon's customer service and I routinely pre-order games and systems from them. In this case, I had ordered the PS3 Display back in September, because they promised that everyone who pre-ordered would get a free copy of Resistance 3. Lo and behold, like many of you probably did, I found out that my order was cancelled--my invoice of September had the correct price of $499.99, but some klutz in Amazon evidently repriced it after I ordered it at $4.99 and then $49.99. Because of this, my order was cancelled. I called their customer service, and the rep ""Bill"" was very kind and understanding, but said he had to ""check with his manager"" to see what he could do. A few minutes later I get a generic email basically telling me tough luck and that I should re-place my order--which meant I wouldn't get it for another few weeks AND I wouldn't get the free game. No apology or anything. Needless to say, I immediately drove to GameStop where they gave me the system and a free copy of Uncharted 3 to boot. My message to Amazon--clean up your act or you'll see a lot more people doing the same.",A must-buy for Playstation fans who want to taste 3D gaming at an affordable price.,1321315200,200,,

Let's start with the story itself. For me it's the greatest. While it remained simple, it still manages to maintain very well entertained and makes you keep wondering what's gonna happen next. The game start off with an awesome (back then the graphics were awesome) opening/intro where you see pretty much the zombies kicking some soldiers ' ass (or eating) and completely overwhelming the humans trying to stop them. the police an special forces are killed by the zombie army. This leaves the Raccoon City's last hope completely defeated.
And so, from this point, and with the city infested by the waking dead, we have our hero Jill Valentine enter the story. And the adventure begins.
You will begin breaking your way through the life-less streets of Raccoon City. you will encounter various different threats, each enemy very different than the last. If you are playing the HARD mode like a true fan, then you will have to be very smart when choosing which enemies you actually have to kill, and which you can just avoid. This will help you save your precious (and very scarce) ammunition.
During your visit at Raccoon city you will encounter, what many call the best RE boss (and they are right, of course): T- type Tyrant code named Nemesis. Be ready, because this BIG guy will make you know the true meaning of the word ""HORROR"" as he will follow you to every room and stage you go. He is relentless and almost invincible. So, make sure you save your best weapons and cures for every encounter with this guy. If you think you are up for the challenge, I strongly advise you to fight him every time you come face to face with him a every time you succesfully defeat him, he will drop special cases with useful items you can use later on to help you make up for whatever you loss during your fight with him.
The soundtrack of the game is the best by Misami Ueda and others. It will give you the chills at the right moments. While navigating the empty streets of RC the soundtrack also gives you that feeling of solitude and that at any moment something can come up jumping at you from every corner or any hole in the ground. My personal favorite is the song at the fianal battle with the Nemesis, which by the way is SOOOO EPPICCCC!!!!

Everything about this game is perfect, no matter your game skill. This is the Nintendo Wii of Fighting games. Never touched a game in your life and you are 83? No prob. You'll toss fireballs in no time. Are you a Pro Gamer like Fatality? Grab an arcade stick and tear into the Ultra Combos for style.

In a nutshell, this game should be part of Obama's stimulus package and given to every American citizen!

Presentation
Clear, easy to navigate menus and options. The HUD is simple to read. If you played any fighter in the past 15 years, you've seen this before.

Graphics
Jawdropping detail and unusual art. Not really anime, but not western art either. The ink-splashes are kind of distracting at first, but then you get sucked into the art of it all and it fits.

Sound
Basically the same sound effects as before, just a little crisper. Music is ok, nothing to wow over.

Gameplay
Gameplay is perfect... WITH AN ARCADE STICK. With a gamepad, it's slightly better than playing Street Fighter Alpha on a gameboy or PSP. Get a stick.

Lasting Appeal
If you are a youngin who missed the first Street Fighter wave, or a die hard street fighter, this game will entertain you for years to come. Casual gamers, it's still a must own for online gaming.","Street Fighter 4... is... well, it's like your highschool sweetie comes back to you after 20 years looking like a super model!",1235260800,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This is not an ideal game for young children who could view this type of behavior and mimic it in real life.  There is also large amounts of cursing and some sexual themes.

Those of you wondering the difference between this version and the regular Persona 3, this has some small additions from the original game which were taken out for the American version.

This is a spectacular game, one of the best RPGs I have ever come across in my 15 odd years as a gamer.  For the older crowd, if you enjoy turn based RPGs this is by far the best I've played in years.  You have an ever changing cast of characters you can choose to play with, the art is spectacular (even for those non-anime fans like myself) and the character voices are believable.  The gameplay is great, you get a lot of side-games and quests which are fun as well and actually serve a purpose within the fighting-side of the game.

I don't know if the Gameboy Advance version has added anything extra, but I know it didn't need to.  The game was perfect years ago, and it's still perfect today.  The only problem I had with the 8 bit game was it couldn't be saved and continued at another time.  I assume the Gameboy Advance version has a saving feature.

I don't know if the levels were painstakingly designed or just thrown together, but they're absolutely great.  Some of them are pretty tough though, especially towards the end where you have to go through all of the tank levels.

Some of the enemies on this game are pretty tough too, particularly the heavyset ones that shake the ground and stun you a bit.

My advice to those playing the game is this:  Don't use the warp whistles if you happen to find them.  They'll jump you ahead to levels that are so difficult you won't have enough lives and items to be prepared for them.  This is a tough game, and it's twice as tough if you try to take shortcuts.  Plus you miss so much when you skip levels.  You miss frog suits, and takooni suits, and the giant enemies, and all of the fun stuff.

This game just has so much variety.  New stuff is everywhere.  Play every level and have a good time.  Find that level with the giant boot to jump around in too.  I love that one.",Thank Goodness We Still Have This,1120780800,3,,

This game is so fun! It is one that will be popular for a long time. Blizzard says they believe in a game where everyone has fun, and they aren't lying.

Now, about the game itself. It is a cartoon FPS game with 22 heroes to choose from. There is several fun game modes such as: Defend payload (You must stop the enemy before the push a payload to the destination), You also have to escort the payload, which is fun but difficult. There is also king of the hill. It is fun but I don't think is as fun as payload.

Pros: Good graphics, no glitches, good physics, well-built characters, and good maps.

I absolutely love Mortal Kombat X and since the Warner Bros. takeover this game has been nothing but improvement after improvement. I am a huge MK fan of 20+ years. Since I was (believe it or not) three years old I have been playing Mortal Kombat since the original games on Sega Genesis. I seen the first film on the big screen when I was five years old. The franchise even inspired me to join martial arts some 15 years ago. I have owned literally every MK game (including game boy versions) except for ""Armageddon"", and it was because I didn't have a console at the time to play it.
This franchise still continues to deliver. MK is, in my opinion, the  best fighting game franchise out there, peroid. These guys continue to make this game great, with brutal fatalities and a slight edge of comedy, meanwhile at the core keeping it a true, well polished fighting game. Moving on, the core gameplay itself, MK X continues the route of keeping Mortal Kombat as ""2.5D"" game, whereas, you combat in a 2D setting, but obviously the game and all models are done in 3D. I personally love this as it goes back to the series roots and was never a fan of the 3D Kombat in the past.

In terms of mechanics and gameplay, this is the most well-refined MK game yet. The game offers new Kombat options, such as being able to hold the ""down"" button after being knocked down, used to deceive opponents and better block large combination attacks. The Kombinations and special moves are short and sweet, but can still be used to generate bigger kombo moves. One new element I like as well is the dialog; it seems like for each fighter, they have a unique dialog depending on who they are fighting against. For example, if Jax fights Raiden, he will say a specific taunt before the match about Raiden. They really went very deep into the fine detail and interaction of the characters in this game.
I also have to largely compliment the storyline. Although a bit short, it extremely entertaining and cinematic, almost like a movie. The online modes have also been improved, with MMO-style features added in. For example, there is new ladder modes, which include daily/weekly challanges to fight you way up a ladder. Points earned in these ladders (as well as general fights) can be contributed towards your ""faction"". You can join one of four major factions online, including the Lin Kuei and US Special Forces.

It just amazes me the amount of fine detail that was put into this game. It is truly a fighting game masterpiece with well polished visuals, sound, and gameplay. If you are a fan of fighting games in any fashion, definitely pick this up. And obviously, this title is a must-have for MK fans.
Now, on the terms of the downsides. I have to agree with the general gaming populace, in some ways, this game is unfortunately micro-transaction oriented. They released a pack of four characters which were stupidly priced at $30. Even for this MK fan who has a good career, that is simply too much to spend on four characters + skins in DLC pack. Also, I also agree with other reviews that, it is kind of frustrating to play against certain characters in the story mode, but not get to actually play them on your own. I am a bit disappointed that they took such a huge DLC route with this game. I am more than happy to pay for extra content/characters, but with that being said, I feel the price point of said DLC has to be reasonable, and it has to be done in a way where I feel like I'm not paying to unlock portions of the full game I paid $60 for.

I am mildly upset about the DLC, but the game is so good and packed full of content, it overlooks it. I'm sure there will be a price drop and one point. I am incredibly happy with the way core game turned out, and I really enjoy MK X and will be playing this game for a long time!

In this game, you'll drive on race tracks from other worlds based on the hit TV series.  They're very detailed, though challenging at some points like certain switches that trigger events, but mostly shortcuts.

The Krals has an appealing look and comfortable design. Its plush, polyurethane ear pads, fit wonderfully and feel really nice. Thankfully the headband features the same soft material underneath it, to keep from cutting into the top of your head. For those with bigger/wider heads than mine, it can be adjusted to accommodate for your size. The headset features transparent lenses on the outside of the ear pads, which allows you to see the circuit boards within. Its not a game changer but if you care for something like that, then it is pretty cool to see the inner workings of your device. Another cool feature is the bright blue LED light, that not only looks great but also acts as an indicator for the headsets different statuses or modes.

All interactions with the Kral will be done on the left ear pad, thanks to the wise decision to place each button and port in one area. Dont worry, they are properly spaced from one another, so you won't end up accidentally hitting the mute button when you really want to change the volume. One minor gripe I have, is with its retractable microphone. While it is flexible, works amazingly for voice chat and is easy to take out when ready for use, putting it back in takes a little more effort than it should. Like I said, it is only a minor gripe and doesnt hurt the overall experience with the headset. Ultimately, it is still a brilliantly designed product.

Setting up on the PS4 is a breeze. Just plug in the wireless transmitter to one of the PS4s USB ports, turn on the headset and you are good to go. No need to go through the trouble of syncing the transmitter with the Kral, as theyve saved you trouble packaging them already synced. If you do happen to come across any issues, then the detailed instruction manual will be of great help. Having used wired devices in the past, it is refreshing to go wireless this time around. No need to worry about tangled cords getting in the way and you have more freedom to move around. Speaking of moving around, the wireless transmitters range is an incredible 100 feet, meaning you can keep the headset as you run to downstairs to answer. Youll be pleased to know that I have yet to encounter any interference, while being far away.

All of the aforementioned wouldnt matter, if the headsets audio quality wasn't up to par. PDP set out to deliver a product that allowed gamers, to hear the games as the developers intended and boy did they deliver. On top of providing crystal clear audio, for the sounds you normally hear, youll also notice every little nuance that would have otherwise been missed. From the soft footsteps of your gaming protagonist to the plane flying off in the distance and more. It really adds to the experience, making any game  with a great sound design, more enjoyable than before. Action games feel more action packed, and horror games are, well more horrifying. I mean seriously, it feels like that creepy voice in the dark is actually behind you, breathing in your ear, taunting you. Its unnerving and I love it. The headset also does a great job of balancing out the in-game audio with the audio of your fellow players when using game chat. If you don't find it balanced enough, you always adjust the settings to find the perfect set up for you.

The Kral features a second audio mode for those of you, like myself, who love a lot of bass in their life. The Bass Boost mode does exactly what the name implies, its amplifies the low end frequency, giving that extra kick to any scenario. Explosions have much more of an impact than ever before. Scoring a head shot in Sniper Elite III, literally made my jaw drop due to how powerful it felt. It is also a great for listening to music with a lot of bass and movies with action heavy scenes and particular scores. Opinions will differ but personally, this is bay far my favorite way to utilize the headset and I don't even bother using the excellent default mode. It is amazing how PDP manages to keep the enhanced bass frequency from compromising the clean audio. If you want more depth to your audio experience, then give this is the mode and headset for you.

While this is marketed as PlayStation 4 headset, this bad boy is also compatible with PC and mobile devices. Setting up via the USB transmitter on my laptop, was just as easy as on my PS4. The process wasn't instant, but it only took around two minutes, so it wasn't an issue. For a quicker set up, you can connect the headset with the included 3.5 mm audio cable but I would only recommend doing so, if you are unfortunate enough to lose your transmitter. The audio quality is still great, but you won't be able to use the Bass Boost mode while wired, not to mention you lose the advantage of going wireless. Still it is great to have the option. You can also go wired with your smartphone and listen to music, watch videos, game, whatever your vice, with the same crystal clear quality. The microphone still works as well, so if you want have a phone conversation of any kind, you can.

The battery life is absolutely impressive, it really does last up to 10 hours as it claims on the box, if not a little longer. Playing games, watching videos, listening to music and chatting on Skype over the course of two days before finally hearing the little audio beep that signals it is time to charge, surprised the hell out of me. The battery itself is rechargeable via the 6-foot play and charge cable. As the name suggest users will be able to charge the headset while you game, listen to music and so forth, so you dot have to worry about any interruptions.

Final Verdict:
The Afterglow Kral is a beast of a headset, comfortable, featuring a great design and outstanding audio. It greatly benefits from being a wireless device but PDP were kind enough to include the option to go wired as well. The fact that it works for multiple devices and is easy to set up is an added plus. I cant praise the Bass Boost audio mode enough. Though it is priced it bit high ($100), it is very much worth it and any PS4\PC owner looking to pick up a headset should definitely purchase it. It is the best gaming headset Ive had the pleasure of using.

This is the best out of tv show games. Why? Because it's true to the show, it has the voice talents of the original actors, and the story and game was made by the creaters. And another Plus is when you play it. you can also control other characters in the game, like death, Quagimire, Cleveland, Defed Up Greased Guy, Peter's Father & Lois. But You can only control theme in some of Stewie's Levels with his mind control. And another plus is that when you play Peter's levels you get to fight some of the characters that Peter gets fights into some of the shows. This Game is like a lost episode, that you'll never see on TV or DVD. Now lets talk about characters.

Stewie: The game starts out that stewie wants to take over the world, Like Always. But Bertrum his Evil brother is in his way. so Stewie sets out to stop him. So hi can do it himself.

Peter: Meanwhile Peter is watching a Mr. Belveder marathon on his tv station PTV, in the mean time when stewie and bertrum duke it out on the roof of the garage Peter goes out and get clonked on the head. While peter is in the hospitle he wakes up and thinks that Mr. Belveder kidnapped his family and goes out to search for him, Oh, did i tell you he thinks everybody he runs into works for Mr. Belveder. From Children To Old People. In some levels petter will get knocked out and turn into some crazy character from the show.

Brian: Now poor Brian is acussed of getting Sebreez Pregnant again. When Joe takes him to jail Brian Escapes your job is to find out who the real Father is and when you get to brians last level you'll get a suprise. Giggity.

The game is really fun. like some of the other reviewrs say this is basically a game for fans. Oh, just one more thing. Another cool part of the game is you get to actually get to play the cut aways. Each character has a diffrent way off geting out of thier perdicaments. But I'll let you find out for yourself.

I rate RED DEAD REDEMPTION, 5 out of 5 stars -

Intro: I want to start by saying this game is AMAZING!! I first purchased it because my cousin said it was a lot of fun, but only knew it was a western themed action game. Upon receiving it, I haven't been able to put the controller down. My wife and I find ourselves playing it nightly after work and have a hard time turning it off to go to bed. With that said, here is a detailed review...

Story: Going into Red Dead I didn't know what to expect. I think this made me enjoy it more and now that I have few a few dozen hours into it, I find the story fantastic. The game starts off reasonable slow, but I wouldn't consider this a negative, because it teaches you how to use your character to his full potential. You start out doing basic missions that involve herding cattle and breaking horses. This really gives you the feeling of the cowboy lifestyle. You eventually build up to doing more difficult missions, much in vein of the Grand Theft Auto style. One thing I really like about Rockstar as game developer is their ability to create very interesting characters - One in the game is named Irish, who is a stereotypical drunk and another is Seth who enjoys digging up graves and searching for treasure. There are many more rememberable characters, but I'll leave them up to you to meet. I can't go into much more detail about what makes the story so brilliant without spoiling it, so I suggest buying it and finding out for yourself! Just take my word for it - It's outstanding.

Gameplay: The majority of the gameplay is going around to different places, saving people and shooting bad guys and animals. There are tons of missions and even though some are repetitive, they are extremely fun! The controls are pretty solid, however sometimes it gets frustrating when you are trying to reach an area and your character moves too fast and won't go exactly where you want him too.

Graphics: Pretty decent overall and for a sand box (open world) game, this one looks really good. The scenery is absolutely amazing! You can watch the sun set and rise in real time.

Sound: Sounds pretty damn good. There are a couple really good songs used at just the right moment. There are also tons of great sound effects that work brilliantly if you have a 5.1 system. From humans screaming, to animals growling... It sounds great!

Replay Value: Replay the game again ""once"" I complete it? I`m really not sure. If you play through the whole game and complete all the side missions, you're looking at, at least 100+ hours of play time. I will at least be replaying some missions, because some are just brilliant (it's great the game gives you the ability to replay any mission you've already completed).

Rent Or Buy This Game? BUY IT!!!

My Personal Verdict & Your Final Score: I really love all the attention to detail Rockstar put into this game. From all the character dialogue, the loads of AI having funny conversations with each other, the amusing replies you get when you tip your hat to a whore, to the scenery. This game just does everything right and by the end I'm sure John Marston will be one of my new favorite video game characters. It is by far the best wild west games I've heard of and seen. It's like the game developers took the coolest stuff about western movies and put it all in the game. The game gets an easy 10.",This game is SO MUCH FUN!!!,1274832000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I mean, you have muscles on top of muscles on top of muscles.  And, for the quest you're about to undertake.....you're gonna need them!

Ticked off by the hand fate has dealt you, you're determined to take on the Greek gods to acquire your vengeance.  Not even Zeus makes you weak in your knees.  Along the way, you have to take on sundry Titans, minotaurs, cyclops and other monsters straight-out of Greek mythology.

As you progress in the game, you can obtain more & more weapons as well as upgrade the ones you already have.  At one point in the game, you duel with Hercules (actually Heracles in the Greek) & if you're able to beat him you get his Nemean Cestus.  That's your most powerful weapon against monsters, although your Spartan blades of exile are probably your most reliable weapon to take out multiple targets @ once.

One of the coolest features of the game is that you can summon temporary godlike powers to assist you in killing the bad guys / bad monsters.  The best one of these is the one associated with your blades of exile:  a ghostly Spartan phalanx of dead Spartans who rise & inflict some major-league damage on whatever it is you're attacking at the time.

The storyline & plot of this game are terrific, as are the graphics.  The game takes you from the depths of Tartarus (deep in Hades) to the summit of Mount Olympus.  There is also a fun scene where you enter Aphrodite's chamber and you get to ""unsheathe your sword"" with her.  She has two other hot cyber babes w/her and I must say this is the best graphic nudity of any video game I've ever played.

5.0,False,"12 22, 2001",A1EE8EZLR8LJ9M,B00005NCCR,Stephen Morrison Lewis,"Devil May Cry is an action packed,  fast pace combat oriented game.  Assume the role of Dante,  Son of the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda,  and conquer Mallet Island and the Dark God Mundus.
First off,  let's talk graphics.  Beautiful!  The moves are fluid,  the cutscenes are flawless.  Dante explores some of the best environments ever to grace a console platform.  The sounds are great as well,  from the blast of the shotgun to Dante's footfalls.
The controls are generally good,  but the shifting camera angles can sometimes make the absolute directional system a bit painful.  In certain spots where chnges are prominent,  you can press the analog stick in one direction and run back and forth almost forever.  This is rarely more than a minor nuisance,  however.  Controls work exellent,  and are very responsive,  which is a must for an action based game.
The gameplay is pretty straightfoward.  Dante explores the castle and surrounding island,  killing monsters which release soul orbs.  Dante offers up these souls to Watcher statues to buy new techniques for his weaponry,  power ups,  etc.  Fighting monsters also recharge his ""Devil Gagues,""  the power derived from his demon half.  As with previous Capcom games,  there is minor puzzle solving,  but the major focus is action.
As if normal mode wasn't enough (There's a reason that there's a hidden ""Easy Auto"" Mode),  there are several more difficulties.  Each time you beat the game on a harder mode,  you unlock more stuff,  including a Mode where you play as the Legendary Dark Knight Sparda himself.
The storyline is also really cool,  with spectacular cutscenses and a great plot.  Unfortunately,  there isn't enough of it,  but this is an action oriented game,  so it's unlikely that this was a primary concern for the design staff (nor does it merit taking away form the rating).
All in all,  if you liked either Onimusha or the Resident Evil series,  or are a fan ofaction/swordfighting/shoot-'em-ups,  Devil May Cry will not disappoint.",Resident Evil meets Onimusha Warlords.,1008979200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Instead of a character inhabiting only one vehicle (making it their own), the story portion of this follows a few different factions: the clown, the doll face, and the reaper. This change may have been put in to accommodate the story battles where you need to pick 3 cars. And let's face it, you won't be winning many race events with the big rig Darkside. So, to that end, having a Sweet Tooth clown clone driving around on Mr. Grimm's motocrycle isn't such a big deal.

The story mode itself is one of the better-done level progressions I've seen in a game for some time. You have 6 stages to beat with each character before you win and then start over with another faction. But while you may end up in the same levels, the objectives may be different. There are events where you need to pick 3 cars and endure your way through killing all the other vehicles out there, because they pretty much only chase you. There is the steel cage-type event where an electronic barrier is put around a couple of city blocks and you have to do battle within that barrier or lose health while outside of it. Then, of course, there is the ultimate: the last boss fight as the doll face. 4 unique stages you have to fight through without dying, as you will be sent all the way back to stage 1 upon dying. It took me hours to beat that last stage (hard difficulty) and finally brought me back to the days when games didn't roll over and let you beat them.

The game itself plays fast. Using the tight turn button when you are at a dead stop can have the screen spinning around, leaving you disoriented. But the action is so fast that when you're rammed and sent flipping and flying through the air, you know when you finally hit the ground that you'll be able to move away from trouble. The levels are very big so leaving the scrum to go find ammo and health isn't too much of a hassle and can lead to some good 1-on-1 moments if you see someone has decided to follow you.

The main event to this game isn't the story mode, though, it's what happens when you fire up multiplayer and can get in a game. As of this writing, there are some issues connecting to games but once connected they play really well. There are a few different game modes to choose from, so here's a little on that:

DEATHMATCH/TEAM DEATHMATCH: kill other cars/kill other cars as a team
HUNTED/TEAM HUNTED: a random player is selected as the ""IT"" target. Everyone else then tries to kill them, hence they are hunted. In the team game, each team has a member that is hunted, so one team chases one guy while one team chases another. Scoring only happens when the hunted kills someone or is killed, themselves.
NUKE: capture a NPC from the other team and follow a missile launcher around that will set off a launch. When the missile is launched, you aim it at the other team's statue. You take turns on offense (trying to steal NPC/sacrifice into a rocket/send rocket into statue) and defense (killing the other team as they try to blow up your stuff). You take 3 turns each until the game is done, top score wins. Apart from all the scoring, you can still kill cars as normal!
LAST MAN STANDING/TEAM LAST MAN STANDING: in single player, everyone gets one life. Whoever is the last one alive wins. In team play, each team starts off with 5 lives. When a player dies, one life goes away. When 0 lives remain, the next death on the team is permanent until all members of the team are killed and one team is declared the winner.

The randomness of who you'll fight (big rig or motorcycle or something in between?), where you'll fight (on a rooftop, in a water aqueduct, on a cliff), how you'll react (no weapons = run!) offer numerous ways a situation can play out. Sometimes you'll just see a scrum of 5 cars going at it and you can just launch yourself into the fray. A lot of fun comes just from escaping those situations. Even though most of the environment is destructible, you'll still call on those driver skills to rush your way through the cities to hunt someone down or escape a pack of vehicles all intent on killing you.

The controls do take some getting used to but, once you're used to it, it feels second nature. In no time, you'll go from being overwhelmed by everything going on on the screen to flying past an enemy, making a tight 180 turn, launching missiles back in the other direction and hitting the turbos to ram and finish them off.

The game is incredibly fast-paced. If you need something a little slower, perhaps the Call of Duty or even Battlefield franchises are appropriate for you. For laughably maniacal fun, this one is one of the better games I've played in the past couple of years.",Insane fun for a fan of the franchise,1329782400,4,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Much more intuitive and user friendly than Wii Fit.  It transferred all of my Wii Fit information over seamlessly.

I remember when I first received Sims Deluxe Edition years ago when it was first released. I got the game from a friend and started playing it and it soon became a ""smash hit,"" for my computer. A year or so later I received The Sims Unleashed. But I never went out and spent loads of money of buying and installing the other expansion packs the game soon fell out of being fun and I went on to better things.
A year ago I decided, after trying to replay my old Sims games, I asked for The Sims Complete Collection. I than got to re-visit with some of the old things I remembered from Sims Deluxe Edition and The Sims Unleashed. But than I got to explore and interact with new surroundings, new items, and new skins! Loads of fun! You have more jobs to choose from and more ways to buy, interact with other Sims.

The Sims (where it all started).
The Sims (Mac) is the start of it all! You are introduced into a tiny neighborhood if you are only playing on this game (the neighborhood I'm talking about is the one located on the upper right-hand corner of the screen) and only offers about seven lots, not much play fun if you wish for more neighbors to interact with. You have fewer items to buy, skins to choose from, and things to do.
But The Sims pact the punch with some other treats, such as The Burglar (a thief that comes to your house at night sometime during the game and steals random items from your home). The way around this is to either install a Burglar Alarm or call for the Police if your home. I once shall the Burglar steal (not the prized TV) but a rug, a wine glass ceiling hanger, and a chair.
Not only do you have to worry about Police, but fires. Your Sim can either be sitting by a cozy fireplace or making grub on the stove when a fire can break out. This is due to happen if you Sims cooking skills are low or if a couch or plant is set close to the fireplace. To battle this, get a fire alarm, have your Sim call a Fire Fighter, or put out the flames her/himself, but they can get engulfed and die quickly. Sims have a knack for panicking out of control at the fire, waving their arms and screaming. But besides all the ""bad,"" of this game you can hire a gardener to take care of your plants for you or hire a maid, but this cost money.
Speaking of money, you get money from your job just like in real life. But just like in real life, you have to pay the bills and if you don't, more and higher priced bills arrive and eventually you lose the house and you lose the game. You also have to worry about having money to fill your fridge and cook meals to keep your Sim alive. To keep your Sims happy and paying attention to his ""Mood,"" bars. Bladder is also important, which can lead to Sims feeling down or disturbed by wetting the carpet.
Appliances have to be kept up-to-date, if a Sims just happens to break the shower or a cooking stove due to lack of skill, they have to repair it. They can either hire somebody for this job, or do it themselves. But if they, once again, are not up to skill with repairing mechanics, they can die. To skill-up your Sims, have them read a book on mechainics or cooking, there are more items for your Sims to up there skills.
Sims can have babies, or adopt them. Which is a pain at when the baby is young, but than the baby eventually grows into a full-fledged kid, whom has to go to school and keep his grades up. If not, he is taken away by Child Care and you are left without one.
Another fun feature is a rather sad, classic character who will make your Sims absolutely miserable! His name is Sunny The Tragic Clown! You can be visited by him if you buy his picture and if you Sims moods decrease, he shows up to make it worse. To get rid of him, either destroy his picture or get your Sim's moods back up to full-fledged green!
Santa Claus can come visit your home if you place out cookies, a Christmas Tree and a fireplace in the same room. Make sure your Sims get to bed so he can arrive! Santa places presents out about the room and than disappears the way he came in, which is buy a red ringed vortex.
And the last fellow character is the most horrifying of all, The Grim Reaper. He only visits if you or a fellow Sim has died and you have to play rock-paper-scissors to get them alive again. The result? They come back to life, go ghost, or stay dead. The later is a grave will pop-up (if its outside) or a mourning ashes jar. You Sims can mourn at it over their loss of a fellow spouse or family member.

Sims Creator!
You can now design your own outfits and even re-do or make your own Sim skins! You can even make Sims that look like you or your family/friends. I even made all the band members from Green Day on SC.

The Sims Livin' Large!
This expansion pack offers more things to do, and especially more items to buy! Loads of fun! You can also get more Sims skins!

The Sims House Party!
This was especially fun to play! You can gather all the needs for a party, such as a dance floor, a cage to dance in, plenty of more items to buy and of course more skins. You are able to invite the neighborhood over and party out! Hire some help like a Canter to take care of re-filling the snacks! If you're party is awesome enough, you can be visited by a famous Caleb (that is, if you have Sims Super Star) but otherwise, you are visited by Ze Mine, who will make your House Party a drool.

The Sims Hot Date!
Your Sims can now go on a date! You are now introduced to Downtown where, of course, you can buy new items. You also get more skins to choose from, new stuff in Build Mode and much more! To get to Downtown, you have to phone in for a cab, which whisk you to the meeting spot wherever you picked from. You can flirt with that special someone by eating dinner and playing footsie in a booth, cuddling, making-out. But if your Sims moods aren't green enough or their relationship up, you might see your Sim get slapped or pushed away.

The Sims Vacation!
Now your family can go on a vacation, either to a beach resort, a forest to camp out or a snow wonderland! But doesn't pack that punch the others had, for things can get boring after playing for a long time. You Sims can buy things, play archer, volleyball, look for treasure, build sand castle, snowboard on a ramp, flirt in a hot tub, and send mail back to a fellow Sim! You have more skins to choose from, more items to buy and more interactions to enjoy!

The Sims Unleashed!

You can now buy pets! Choose from a dog, a cat, parrots, turtles, hamsters and fish by going to Old Town to your local pet shop! You can buy items for your pets, and interact with them by playing fetch, ect... But beware, for your pets are a lot like people, and need special edition to keep them home. If not, they become strays or are taken away. You pets can also have puppies/kittens which appear in the dog house or a basket. Its your responsibility to care for them until you can sell them, or keep them if you wish. Also, you can take your pets to shows and win awards. But before that, you have to train them, and that is extremely hard since they not exactly like people. You can't control them really, except make them walk here or there.
You can also be visited by fellow pest, such as strays who seek unwanted attention, roaches, mice, rabbits, gophers and raccoons! But your pets can take care of this problem (if they feel like it) by attacking and destroying the pesty animal. Your pets can also die, so make sure to feed them and take care of their bladder. You can also buy them treats, scratching post, beds and toys.

The Sims Superstar!
Yes folks, you can now be a superstar! But at what? You can be a famous rock star, a fashionist, or movie actress or a performer! But this you have to work at, which is far more engrossing than having a regular job/career. You have to have lots of friends, of course, your skills must be up to the max to succeed, and you have to have lots and lots of famous friends! This is tough, for if you don't have enough ""Star Power,"" (how high you are up on the Hot List) than the rich and famous will ignore you. Battle this buy obtaining Sims friends that are as low as you are but have a bit of star power. Eventually you will get higher friends and keep at it in Studio Town by either performing at the karaoke or acting out a script. If you work at it enough, you can become a Super Star!
Another feature in this is a few other things. You can now hire a butler, an are harassed by Obsessed Fans that follow you everywhere you go, even to your house! To battle this, you can download an Odd Body Guard that beams them down and makes their life a living hell!

The Sims Makin' Magic!
In Makin' Magic your Sims can now be fellow witches and wizards! Perform magic, buy magical items and of course, get more stuff to interact with! You receive a box from the Mysterious Man that drops it off at your house, he knocks on your door, drops the package and leaves without a word. You can open the box and receive magical items to make your magic, such as a spell book, a A Spellbound Wand Charge and a EverAfter Crafter. You can also buy a hole that is an instant ticket to Magic Town where you buy all your ingredients and do quest to gain rare magical items. You also are able to bake your own ingredients, have more skins and items to choose from. And can even buy yourself a dragon egg! But the dragon egg has to be cared for constantly unless you want a hatchling to flame your house down upon hatching!
Besides getting regular Sim money, you get Magic Coins which can be exchanged for goods. If you save up enough, you can buy a creepy, haunted house located in Magic Town.
This is my favorite Sim game out of all of them.

[Fun Extras]

You can download more items, skins, ect... from sites online, use cheat codes to ""green-up,"" your Sims Health, make more money and even in-put your own music/shows for TV/Computer.

You have to get this game if you like even the simplest of RPG games, or even action games since that was basically how combat worked.  I think there's basically something for everyone to like here.

Let's start with the story: You're the top of your class at a martial arts school located in the sticks of ancient Japan.  Your master has a very important 'something' to tell you, and of course, he keeps getting interrupted by various things, an angry pupil, a crazy magician/ninja/pirate guy who randomly attacks your village, and so forth, until you figure out that you're the last descendant of a special group of people, and well...you get the picture.  It's another one of those 'chosen one' stories, but this one is particularly well-written and has enough twists and turns to make it interesting throughout.

You get a fair number of companions who are by-and-large exactly the same, but they have interesting back stories and will give you advice or make suggestions of things to do along the way.  I basically kept with Dawn Star the entire game, who I thought was the most unique of the different characters, but she really didn't seem any better or worse with any of the others insofar as combat was concerned.

There is also a little minigame that the developers thought to add in, which you can opt out of if you don't like it.  It's a throwback to the old 2D helicopter games that you might have played back in the day on your Sega Genesis where you fly back and forth and shoot anything that moves.

Combat requires the use of a number of styles of combat that you can use, and this seems to be very customizable, though there are some styles that I think are simply better than others (the sword style in particular seems almost unfair).  I counted around 20 different styles that were available to me at the end of the game.  You also get to upgrade each style when you level up, and what's nice about this is that it's almost completely customizable, so you can distribute points where you like, and there's no way for you to max out all of your styles.  At the most, you can probably max out three or four, but it pays to distribute them to different types of styles (hand-to-hand, weapon, magic, and transformational) since some enemies are immune to certain styles.  You switch styles like you'd switch weapons in a traditional shooter, and you can easily switch between two or more in combat.

My biggest problem with the game was that I thought there should have been more to do in terms of armor and weapons.  There appears to be only one upgrade for each of the weapons, and no armor comes into play at any point in time.  You do shop around for ""training"" which just modifies your statistics, usually doing something along the lines of adding three to one stat while taking one away from another.  That was OK, but it basically came down to the fact that you simply buy all the training you can find because no matter what you do, your stats will always be increasing.

Jade Empire has a whole lot of interesting characters (and all the dialog in the entire game is voice-acted, a nice touch), and there don't seem to be too many palate swap characters, so it is a very realistic world.  Nothing was too easy or too complicated.  Overall, I may have minor complaints, but they were very, very minor, and I think this is certainly a must-own game for anyone who likes any kind of computer game.

I'm using the G600 on a PC with Windows XP Home SP3; the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) version is 8.45.88.  The firmware version is 77.02.17.  I'm also using the G600 on a PC with Windows 10 Technical Preview with LGS version 8.57.145.

Several years ago, I switched from a regular 3-button mouse to a Logitech G700. It took some time to get used to the G700, but I liked the G700 very much. The same is true for the switch from G700 to G600. It takes a little time to get used to it, but it is worth it.

I do like lots of buttons on my mouse for flexibility in Windows applications, browser, and games.  I don't always use every button, but I have the flexibility to do so.

WEIGHT
The G700 with battery (can't run it without the battery installed) weighs 6 ounces.  The G600 weighs 5 ounces.  I've heard some people complain about how heavy the G600 is, but I don't have any problem with the weight, because my prior mouse was a G700 (which is 1 ounce heavier).

SIZE
I measured both mice across the top over the scroll wheel area. The G700 measures 6 centimeters; and the G600 measures 7 cm.  Not much difference, considering the G600 adds a third button along the right side.

SCROLL WHEEL
Both mice have a tilt scroll wheel with 3 buttons built in (middle click, left tilt, right tilt). I like the wheel tilt feature very much. The G700 wheel is metallic on its sides and rubber down its middle; you can set it to have smooth rolling or notched. The G600 is all rubber; you can not set it to smooth rolling...it's notched and that's it. I like notched, so it is not a problem for me.

BUTTON CLICKS
When clicked/pressed, the tactical feel of the G9-G20 buttons (the 12 buttons on the left side) on the G600 is like the G11 button on the G700.  The G600 G7-G8 buttons sound/feel like the G700 G9 button.  The left, middle, right, scroll tilt buttons on the G600 feel the same as their counterparts on the G700. I don't have to press G600 thumb buttons as hard (compared to G700), and the thumb buttons on the G600 take less pressure to actuate.

G-SHIFT BUTTON
I like this button a lot. It doubles the function of all mouse buttons except left click, right click, G8, and the G-Shift button itself.  So, the mouse has 20 buttons, and with the G-Shift, the mouse now has 36 button options.  Lots of flexibility.  Very nice.  If you reassign left click to another button, then you can use the left click button with G-Shift (same for right click).  For G8, if you use it with the G-Shift, then you can assign 2 functions to it, but you lose the mode switching ability for that profile.

If you don't like the G-Shift button, then you can unassign it, and assign another function to that button.  You can always get it back by dragging/dropping the G-Shift function from the commands list/menu to the button.

GRIP
With my fingers together, my hand measures about 8.25 inches around...just below the knuckles, which makes my glove size a medium. The G600 feels very nice to me. Because it glides so easily, and because of its shape, I find that I don't have to grip it as hard as the G700...and that's easier on my hand.

On the thumb side of the mouse...
The mouse glides very well. I can rest my thumb on the side buttons and move the mouse around easily without actually pressing the side buttons. Sometimes I rest my thumb just beyond or below the G9 button. Either works well for me...depends on what I am using the mouse for.

On the ring/pinky finger side of the mouse...
This took a little getting used to, but it works well. Again, two choices: If I am not using the G-shift button, then I can rest my ring finger along the side of the button. However, I do like the G-shift button, so I rest my ring finger on top of it. My pinky finger grips the mouse on the right side. Since the mouse is lighter (compared to the G700), using my pinky finger to grip and help with movement is not a problem for me. The bottom edge of this side of the mouse is rubber, which helps to grip it. Does your pinky hurt? Give it a chance. Your muscles will adjust.

Depends on how you use your mouse...
In games, instead of using the traditional W-S-A-D keys for movement, I use mouse buttons. I started doing this with the G700, using the wheel tilt for left/right, G7 forward, G6 back, G7 plus G5 forward sprint/run. This makes movement much more natural in my opinion.  For the G600, it's similar: wheel tilt for left/right, G11 forward, G20 back, G11 plus G10 forward sprint/run. Since I am usually walking or running forward, I am gripping the mouse with my thumb most of the time. When not gripping the mouse in this way, I grip it with the area of my palm below my thumb (or just beyond the G9 button). This works well for me.

TRACKING, POLLING/REPORT RATE, DPI
For the G700, I used 1000 DPI and 250 for report rate.  For the G600, I am using the same settings. The mouse tracks very well for me; this is probably a combination of mouse quality and PC configuration.

LOGITECH GAMING SOFTWARE (LGS)
I used this same software for my G700, so it is nothing new to me. Same software, except the screens are different in order to support the additional/different features of the G600. I recommend using ""automatic game detection"", not on-board memory (this setting is on the home page of the LGS; it's a toggle switch). While using the G700, I switched from Setpoint software to LGS, and I noticed that onboard memory did not work well (it was fine with Setpoint, just not LGS). For the G600, I didn't even try on-board memory, since ""automatic game detection"" works so well for me.

MODES VS. PROFILES
I use automatic game detection for both G700 and G600, which means unlimited profiles and no hassles with profile switching...works well for me.  For the G600, there are also modes.  So, for each profile, you can have up to 3 modes...each mode has its own button configuration. Here is how this is helpful to me... Game #1: The main character has two movement options: human, which is used most of the time; mechanized armor/tank, which is used occasionally. The controls are different for each. So, I have 1 profile for the game with 2 modes (one for the human, one for the armor/tank). Press the mode switch button (G8 or whatever you want to set it to) and I can easily switch between human and armor/tank settings.  Very nice.

CORD
The G700 cord is rubber coated. The G600 cord is less thick and braided nylon. Both work fine. The G700 cord showed no signs of wear after 3+ years of use.  Wait and see with the G600 cord.

LIGHTS
The G700 has 3 lights on the side to indicate what profile you are using (if you use onboard profiles, which I don't). The G600 is a regular Christmas tree...each of the G9-G20 buttons are backlit, and there are lots of color and lighting options. Very nice, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm not, so I disabled the lighting effect.

SOME GOTCHAS

GOTCHA #1
Converting profiles from the G700 to the G600.  These 2 mice have different buttons, so don't expect to plug-and-play. Although you can see the G700 profiles in the LGS when the G600 is plugged in, you cannot use the G700 profile successfully unless you remap all keys to the G600. It's easy to do. All of the commands associated with a profile are listed in the commands menu area in LGS (on the left side of the screen). Drag and drop the commands from the commands menu to the G600 buttons and you're ready to go.  If you are permanently switching from G700 to G600, remapping existing profiles is fine. If you plan to use both mice interchangeably, then rename the G700 profiles to have G700 in the name, and copy/save-as the G700 profiles to G600 profiles and do the remapping; so, you'll have 2 sets of profiles...one for G700 and one for G600.

GOTCHA #2
Setting or assigning commands to the normal and G-shift buttons. ""Normal"" means the normal use of a button without using the G-shift button. ALWAYS drag and drop commands from the command menu on the left side of the ""customize buttons"" screen to the mouse button on the right side of the screen. NEVER use the little drop down menu for each button to edit commands; it's okay to use the drop down menu to unassign, use generic, use default. If you don't follow this advice, then when you attempt to edit commands for G-shift buttons, you will overwrite the normal button assignment with the G-shift assignment. It's just a quirky software thing. To create new commands, use the plus sign next to the word ""Commands"".

GOTCHA #3
By default, the mouse wheel tilt buttons are assigned to back and forward; and this works great when working with Windows applications and browsers.  However, some people like me had the problem of the G600 going back twice or going forward two times when only clicking the tilt button once (i.e., double click problem). In Windows XP, the solution is to go to Control Panel, System, Hardware tab, Device Manager button, expand Mouse, double-click each ""HID-compatible mouse"" device to find the one that says ""on Logitech gaming Virtual Mouse"", and then right click that device and disable it. This solved the problem.

4.5/5

Supreme Commander 2 is not a perfect game by any means, but is a massive improvement over the original. The original game was plagued by some issues that made it hard to approach. Among these issues are the ridiculous system requirements (bad optimization). SupCom 2 looks better and runs better than the original. I'm using an AMD FX-4100 with a GeForce GTX 550Ti (far from top-of-the-line, but should be more than enough for a game from 2007) and Supreme Commander 2 runs perfectly on max settings with 16Q anti-aliasing and 16 anisotropic filtering. SC:FA slows down on even medium settings. But that is just a look under the hood of the game.

I will address common complaints of this game, since so many people seem to hate it for silly reasons.

Graphics:
I've seen complaints of ""bad graphics,"" but it simply isn't true. I talked with some people about what they meant, and the only ones who could elaborate said it looked ""like anime or toys."" I can see the anime complaint on the cut scenes, but toys? Maybe the Illuminate units look a little cartoon-like, but the game looks wonderful. On my 21.5"" 1920x1080 display, on max settings, this game is eye candy.

Scale:
Scale was a big appeal in the original, but it was honestly overkill. If I have to spend 5-10 minutes just moving my units to the enemy base, I'm not having any fun. 90% of a match on the original consisted of managing your base and watching your units march across the map. This wasn't fun; it was stupid (my opinion, take it or leave it). The reduced scale didn't ruin anything, but it also made the game more approachable, and I am far from being a casual gamer.

Research tree:
The tier system of the original game was just bad. Tier 2 units replaced tier 1 units entirely, and tier 3 replaced tier 2. Not to mention, upgrading to the next tier level was a chore. While the research tree is flawed, it is fundamentally better than tiers. Had the developer merely balanced it better and added more gameplay functions to compliment it, it would have been a perfect system. Nonetheless, I prefer it to the tier system of the original game, as units don't become obsolete.

My suggestions for how the tree could be improved:

- General balance improvements.

- Add a linear progress bar below the tree that fills up as points are spent in any tab of the primary tree. Move necessary upgrades and unlocks to it, so EVERYONE gets them just by researching in general. These would include resource income bonuses, anti-nukes, and overall build speed / cost reductions. Perhaps some other things would fit in here. In this way, everyone has access to essentials while also having the freedom to pursue specific niche units and abilities.

- Remove the instant upgrade to active units via research. Add a refit button to units so they must become stationary and disable weapons for a period of time to upgrade with newly researched tech. The more research you have unlocked without doing a refit, the longer it takes. Also add this button to factories themselves, to automatically upgrade all units within a set radius in half the time a field refit would take. In this way, you could no longer turn the balance of a fight by spamming research.

No adjacency bonuses:
These were implemented poorly in the original, but could have been a good idea with some basic redesigning. I'd rather them be gone entirely than thrown into the game in the same state of the original.

Less Unit Types:
There are plenty of unit types, and better yet, they all remain viable throughout the match. (just throwing out random numbers) Why have 50 units and have 40 of them be obsolete when you can have 20 and have them all be useful?

Illuminate unit names:
A legitimate complaint. I hate the names of the units. They are gag-inducing.

Now, like I said, this game is far from perfect. A lot of good features were removed for the sequel. I don't understand why some of them were removed. These include:

- Queued building ETAs. So useful, if not always accurate.

- The streaming resource output. There is no reason I should have to wait until a structure's resources are all collected before I begin construction.

- Build templates.

- Probably some others I can't recall at the moment.

Issues with the game:

- No ""base is under attack"" warning. As annoying as these are in StarCraft, I'll be damned if I don't know my base is under attack. In SupCom2, I sometimes find the back of my base has been invaded and I've been crippled because nobody knows how to report an attack to the commanding officer. Thanks guys.

- Faction imbalance. UEF is particularly crazy with their overpowered turtle tactics.

- Little mod support.

- Beacons in multiplayer don't make a noise or easily noticed visual effect. Voice chat is almost required.

In summary, this is a seriously underrated title, but maybe could have been better, but what game doesn't have room for improvement? It is a great game for anyone other than the die-hard Forged Alliance fanboy who can't accept that his game was flawed. Supreme Commander 2 is more approachable, but is far from being ""dumbed down"" as so many claim. It is a very entertaining game. Don't let the angry fans of the original convince you otherwise; try the demo.

For the record, I enjoy the original game as well. I just prefer 2.","Awesome Game, Despite Some Flaws and Fanboy Outcry",1350172800,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I thoroughly enjoyed playing the first two Infamous games on PS3, playing both sides of good and bad and earning all the trophies. So of course I was going to purchase this hands down. I will say it started off rather slow for me, but once I started to understand the potential of how fast you level up, I was hooked.

You do not play with only one power throughout the game like Cole did in the first 2 games with just electricity, but you learn how to play with up to 4 different powers. Neon was my favorite during my first play through, but Video was more fun to play on my second run through. I will say I was a little bummed out with the melee combat, it didn't feel upgraded. I had more fun playing melee in Infamous 2, but that's just my only gripe when it comes to combat.

Getting through the city is fun and fast, especially when you run around with Neon and Video. The only aggravating problem would be sometimes you try to land on a certain spot and Delsin will reach out and grab the closest ledge on his own, or sometimes you'll think he would grab a certain part of a building and ends up not grabbing anything. Also, he ends up getting stuck underneath overhangs. After awhile you learn and adapt.

Side missions are fun, but get repetitive. Story missions are okay, and there's only a few moral choices to make. Only a few boss battles. The city looks cool when you're flying up high and look around, but you realize it's not really big. It doesn't feel big at all, but it's a big enough playground. The graphics are great. No load times, just when you start up the game. I did not experience any glitches, even during parts of heavy combat.

I played evil on my first play through on the regular difficulty setting, and it was hard.

I played good on my second play through on expert level and it was easier, and I enjoyed it a lot more. Probably because I already knew what to do.

It's very easy to gain all the trophies in this game. Be sure to find all the blast shards to level up your powers, well worth the time. If you have or haven't played any Infamous games, I would definitely give this game a try.

The one-to-one swordplay is also pretty fun, I gotta admit - and I'm someone who usually prefers not to use WiiMotes because I'm not a fan of them.

In short, this game is a beautiful story of the origins of Link, Zelda and Ganon. It's so freaking pretty that I'm rendered nearly speechless looking at the art and graphics.

5.0,True,"10 18, 2013",AOYGPHW4YMYEO,B000UW21A0,Shaide,"I just recently had the honor of playing the PS3 exclusive game Uncharted: Drakes Fortune. The game is fairly old, however you wouldnt guess that by looking at the jaw dropping graphics. You might be wondering if it is so old, why did it take so long to play it? Well, to begin with I didn't have any interest. I saw videos, and screen shots and to be honest, I thought it was going to be Tomb Raider with a male leading character, and I despised the TOmb Raider games, even more than I despised the Tomb Raider movies!

When I finally played it, I learned quickly that the ame is NOTHING like Tomb Raider, which is a good thing. In fact, the game is really unlike anything I have ever played. Sure, the story might not be original, and some of the dialog might be a bit clich&eacute;, but the gameplay its self is truly unique and entertaining!

Basically, the story follows Nathan Drake, who happens to be a treasure hunter. Kind of like a modern-day Indiana Jones, except not quite as cool. As you start playing, one of the things you will notice is the tutorial guides. They are extremely helpful and informative, and teach you how to manuever around the world of Uncharted. It is highly advised that you do not ignore these.

The controls are simple enough so that anyone can pretty much pick up a gamepad and begin playing, and if you are having trouble, the game guides you into the action. You aren't tossed head first into life and death situations. So, by the time you are in the heat of it all, you will be quite comfortable with the controls and play style of the game.

Everything about this game is great, the Story, though not original is entertaining, and the voice acting os probably some of the best that I have heard in video games to date! Theres not a thing about this game anyone can complain about. Well, at least not til toward the end.

You see, as you begin nearing the end of the game, Uncharted decides to introduce a new enemy type to the game. This Enemy is a melee enemy which just so happens to pack quite a punch. This means all of a sudden you are forced to break away from the controls you are used to. The method of combat that you have lovingly been introduced to is pretty much tossed out on its ear. Gone are the days of taking cover and aiming down the barrel for accurate shots. In order to survive you simply have to run like a maniac and shoot from the hip. Yea, suddenly, the game becomes a standard RunN'Gun type game. To make matters worse, the game doesnt give you any indication that, now might be a good time to change your entire play style.

This sudden change made the game frustrating, however After I played it and finished it, and looked back at the game. I think it was a nice touch. Sure it was a pain in the ass, but it gave the game a sense of confusion and panic. It made the game seem to come alive.

Over-all I would say the game is top-notch and is a must own, and am throughly impressed with this game title. Never before have I been this pleasantly surprised with a video game title.

Looking forward to trying Uncharted 2 now!",Stunning and breath taking,1382054400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Half-Life 2 comes across as a living breathing world, a world where extra-dimensional aliens have taken the Earth, and the remaining humans are living in internment camp/cities or joining the resistance.  The character designs and voice-acting are top-notch, the controls are fluid and easy, and the Havok engine means you get to interact with almost every random object on the screen.  I loved using the 'gravity gun' to hurl a can of paint at a head-hugger zombie, and having the paint make a nice splatter that remained on its torso while it pursued me, for example.  Little real world details abound, from birds overhead, combine officers chatting off-camera, civilians muttering about their plights, trains in the distance, combine propaganda posters covered with graffiti, etc.

Don't expect enemies that expose themselves and just stand there, either.  These enemies DO use cover, and WILL attempt to flank you.

Valve's Steam server is also a great addition if you're an avid gamer, BTW.  They own a lot of great older titles (Deus Ex, The Longest Journey, Pirates!, to name a few) that you can download, and the server usually does a PC scan to optimize your graphics settings for the best gameplay. Plus you can delete them for space and re-download them anytime.

The story of this game follows Ribbon, a fairy of Ripple Star, trying to retrieve the crystal shards which were scattered throughout 6 worlds after Dark Matter smashed them (they were all one huge shard). Ribbon is aided by Kirby, King DeDeDe (that's right, DeDeDe is now a friendly character), Waddle Dee (another enemy now turned friendly), and Adeliene (many say this Ado from Dreamland 3 which I also think is true). Thus, the main goal of this game is collecting all the crystal shards.

If you liked the original but have played it to exhaustion, then here's a way to refresh your supply of puzzles and tests.

Pros: The games are more varied, now including a musical one, among others. They're also more challenging--on the first one, I'd reached age 20 in about a week.  With this one, I'm still hovering around 26 after a month and a half. This gives it longer play value. They've also introduced a tetris-like mini game that's a nice diversion. The handwriting recognition seems to be better, though it's still not perfect.

Cons: Handwriting recognition glitches still lead to the occasional frustration of something getting marked wrong that really isn't. It still has limited replay value, since once you've unlocked all the training modes and reached a certain score on them, you tend to lose interest. And Dr. Whats-his-name still talks too much. Basically it has all the same flaws as the first one did.

The things that ade those games great are still there, but have been refined quite a bit. Some notable changes include limited respawns (I think each enemy can die 10 times before it no longer respawns, meaning you can still farm, but it's limited, and you can clear areas if you really want to), respec (one thing I think most people have wanted),unlimited bonfire storage (you can store items in your loot box from any bonfire, to be accessed whenever you stop to rest), a more defined jump,and what seem to be less clunky combat. Leveling up has changed as well. Specifically, you can only level up in one location.
Although I think the graphics are better, many disagree with me, so you'll just have to judge for yourself.

I've put more than 10 hours in so far and am loving every moment of it. The game still rewards patience and definitely penalizes haste and arrogance, lol.

The CE itself is quite nice. The downloadable content (weapons/armor) is really nice, the statue is big and glorious (and currently standing watch in my living room), the art book is fantastic, and even the cloth map is cool (although I could personally take or leave it). I think it was a well thought out CE that really gives you your money's worth.

Anyhow, I will update this if necessary, but man.....definitely loving this game.

ed:Okay, I've put in more than 100 hours at this point. This game has become something of an obsession, lol. In addition to the solo game, the co-op is pretty stellar (and actually, it seems like they actually increased the difficulty of a number of bosses and a few other areas to encourage co-op). There have been some pretty epic moments to be had after summoning or being summoned to help. The PvP is also pretty fun, and can be pretty hectic in a couple areas where members of certain covenants are auto summoned to invade your world. That can lead to having as many as three invaders at the same time (at least, that is the max I've encountered in those invasion dedicated areas. There are also NPC invaders at various points of the game as well. Additionally, there are quite a few helpful NPC phantoms that can be summoned before various boss battles, and who have quest lines tied to their participation.

The world is huge, a visual masterpiece and with so much to do. Combat is reminiscent to traditional JRPGs but with a more modern real time aspect(like the first Xenoblade Chronicles). The Skells(mechs) you get access to eventually make exploring so much more fun, and are not game breaking by making combat super easy.

Some of the quests can get repetitive, which is to be expected from any open world RPG, but not agonisingly boring either thanks to how amazing the world itself is.

One of the best parts is you can put as much or little into it as you want. Most of the character development comes from side quests, with the main story focusing on the situation at hand. Which makes sense, you don't need to get to know your teammates' background and feelings to work towards saving humanity (hypothetically speaking) but if you choose to learn more about the characters the option is there. You can zip through the game in 50-60 hours, or you can take your time and explore the vast world and learn about the people in it.

I think this will be the first open world game where I strive for 100% completion. I plan on getting the guide soon.

  The main flaw in Assassin's Creed is that there isn't enough variety and planning in the assassinations. Most of the time it is impossible to get to your target without fighting your way through the guards so planing and stealth doesn't help much in the actual assassinations(it's a good thing that Assassin's Creed has a great combat engine). The other flaws are: The assassin can't change disguises and you would think a real assassin would, The assassin can't swim and it seams like someone so well trained in all other ways would know how to swim, and the story doesn't end but this isn't really a flaw because they are making a sequel but I don't know when it will come out except that UBISOFT has started on the sequel and it probably won't be out this year(2008)

  Assassin's Creed is a good blend of action/adventure and open-world. It far longer and more open than most action games and much more story driven then most open-world games. Also it has far more realistic and detailed game Play and graphics than any game I've played: running, jumping, climbing, and fighting are all smooth, fluid and realistic. Game play is well balanced between your mastery of the controls and the difficulty of your opponents while maintaining a smooth realistic look(I never got tired of the fights even though some of the other aspects of the game got rather repetitive and dull).

  I recommend a X box type controller and even though the game's tutorial isn't designed for it a PlayStation type controller also works well if you set the game on X box and press 1 when it tells you to press 0, 2 when it tells you to press 1 and so on(I used a PlayStation type controller)

It is somewhat confusing, and the narrator constantly uses words that throw you off the game. This is covered up by the gameplay, however.
The controls, as many people would complain about, aren't that difficult to master. Everyone considers it difficult, because its a new interface.
Throughout the game, you kill various monsters, and from them you get experience points. With these points you eventually level up, giving you more health, higher stamina, and the abilities to new combination moves for your weapons.

i just beat Timesplitter: Future Perfect on easy difficulty in the story mode in just a shade under 4 hours. which is pretty long in terms of story modes for timesplitters games.  i haven't even touched the other 14 or so modes yet, and i heard that there are over a hundred hours of gameplay to be lost in this game, so it should keep me, and you, busy for a while.

to start off with, the major changes i noticed since the last game came out, is that the graphics seem much sharper, the controls are much tighter, and the weapons are much cooler.  when i first threw a time grenade (i think that's what it's called) and everything slowed down except me, i almost laughed out loud at how freakin' cool it was.  and in this timesplitters, for the first time in the series, there is actually blood!  in one level you must decapitate a bunch of zombies, with either a magnum, shotgun, or a baseball bat (oh, and there is a new and quite useful melee attack, for when you want to conserve ammo), and when their melons pop, it makes a cool ""head exploding sound"" and blood sprays everywhere.  but no fear, the game still retains its comic humor and graphics.

their is actually a storyline this time that pulls you in, and pushes you through every wormhole you see.  the main character you play as is one Cortez, a Vin Diesel lookalike winner.  shortly into the game, you run into yourself, literally.  then throughout the game, you keep running into other versions of yourself that help you out in order for you to get further and do that same thing for yourself, so you are actually the version of Cortez that helped you out in the first place.  confused?  don't be, the game makes it very easy to comprehend.  the story follows Cortez as he makes his way through time, trying to stop the Timesplitters (evil alien things that can, well...split time and travel about history at their own free will) from destroying mankind.  along the way, Cortez runs into all different kinds of interesting characters, from a British boatman/saver of a damsel in distress, to a punk-esque girl trying to work her way into a club, but first she must photograph zombies and other scary things.  about halfway through the game, you meet up with a robot that just doesn't leave your side for very long...but don't worry, he's pretty damn funny.  and that's another thing about this game, this time around, the computer controlled allies that fight along side you actually fight and help you out, they don't get stuck on walls and freeze mid-battle for some unknown reason.

like i said, i haven't touched the challenge mode or anything yet, but if it's anything like the series' past challenge mode, then i should be in for quite a treat.  i can also create my own story and arcade mode levels using the game's map-maker.  there are over 150 characters to unlock in this game, and tons of different ways to unlock them.

gas/brake thru the shifter paddles.

The cons of the wheel is the actual shift buttons (1 and 2) are somewhat inconvenient (which would make it nice if it had pedals so you could use the paddles for shifting) so I use ""auto"" shifting in these games. The other con is it only works for three Wii games (also including DIRT)

Still, for the low price here on Amazon, it is literally a steal over the regular Wii ""air"" wheel, providing you have those games.

Usually the story in Baldur's Gate, etc is fairly linear.  You proceed from point A to point B and it sure seems like point B is just like point A except it has snow or lava.  It seems as if the focus is on character creation and combat while the story is tacked on.  But the Bard's Tale actually makes it seem like the story comes first and is meant to entertain you while you kill everything and solve the quests.  The game plays a lot like other X-box RPG games but lacks a lot of the hours of character creation and equipment upgrades that the other RPGs have.

First, I have at least 10+ people on my friend's list who LOVE this game. Not one has said they did not.

Second, IMO, this is a classic. And I also feel it is for the 'older' crowd who can appreciate the very cool humor this game has. If your over 40 you will love this thing. (Play on easy - trust me)

This is more of a cult game, and, as with most cult movies, they bomb when they come out. They are panned by critics and then, slowly, & with a bit of time, they become classics. This is definately one of those titles.

Playability is smooth no matter what people say. The 'cover' system reminds me a lot of Quantum of Solace (another great game) and the voice overs are very cool. As the number 1 player in the world (XBox 360) said on his blog recently, it's very ""refreshing"" & ""funny"" and a nice change of pace.

I feel that the programmers deserve major brownie points for this title. It is so clever and filled with nostalgia that only a gamer from the 'actual' 80s would appreciate this. Truly, because of the new generation of kids, the humor, hidden jokes & level graphics are beyond them (with all due respect).

So, if you are a gamer who was raised with some of the first videogames that *ever* came out (Handheld Computer Football or Pong anyone?) then this title is for you.

It also would, IMO, make a great gift for an Over-40 couple who want a fun drinking game for a Friday night (on easy mode remember!).

One last thought. I've read numerous reviews on many sites as well as this one. After finishing this game to full completion (1000 gamerscore) I've realized that the developers did most of what people are complaining about ON PURPOSE. Namely, the silly 'Melee' attacks, the feminine running style of the character, the absolutely hysterical AI, and most notably, the graphics.

Again, if you're at least 40 or more, you'll appreciate this absolutely wonderful change-of-pace compared to what's come out the last few years. It's the perfect mockery to everything videogames were back in the 80s, 90s and yes, even up to today.

Kudos goes out to the whole team (who I know are reading this) for making something that is truly so refreshing and unique that I say, FORGET the bad rap. In 10 years, people will still be talking about this title for the plain and simple fact that more and more older people are getting into videogames everyday. And that is who this game is truly for.",Cult classic.,1237161600,28,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Ok let me step above all of the amazon junkies, you know the team of people who come here with different aliases and a mission to write bad reviews on great products? Yes, they really do exist, and no I can't understand how they have time to do it but they do. Ok now that thats out the way, how is Civ V? The game has a fast smooth interface that far succeeds the previous titles. For example, no more digging around for this and that, its all right there and you can click around and do things quickly. Trust me, at the end of a game, your mouse hand will be happy with much less clicking around. Next, no more useless things that are just in the game to be in it. Everything in Civ V has its uses no matter what it maybe. Next, happiness takes on a global level, I can't say how much of an improvement this is but lets just say Civ has become more fun and less work. Next, for the first time ever Civ now has hexes and this is a major improvement. You can only have one unit per hex but units are like small armies now which is more realistic instead of a single warrior walking around. Next, the graphics have seen an overhaul and it shows, for example check out some screenshots and look at the incredible water effects. The units and animations are also right up there with RTS games, these are just excellent. Next, we have range attacks which is yet another plus added to this series. Let me give an example, an archer unit can fire from 2 hexes away. Next, we have embarked transport units which is another much needed feature. This works much like it did in rise of nations. For example, a unit can move from the shore into the sea and automatically be embarked on a transport. These transports change through the time periods so you can have sail ships then later modern cargo ships and those look great! Next, there are now options when you take over a city and it works great. Those are annex, puppet or raze sometimes liberate too if it was another country's. Annex creates a huge amount of unhappiness but the city is all yours. Puppet creates much less unhappiness and you can't pick what a city builds but you still get all the gold, culture and science it produces. Raze burns it down off the map but it takes turns which is more realistic. For example, if you raze it, it loses one population per turn until it its all gone then the city is eliminated. Liberate will give the city back to its original owner. Next, now when you build parts for a spaceship, you have to transport them to your capital before you can install them. It moves on a cool looking ground transport. This is an excellent feature because you can be close to winning and you could be attacked while transporting a part to your capital. Next, social policies takes the place of civics. Its bascially a tree of policies that you select and has a huge effect on the direction your nation goes through the game. There are things there which helps small empires and other policies that can boost your war efforts or economy, things like that. Next, a really nice addition is city states. These are small countries that are not civs but can be trade partners or allies. This maybe one of the best changes in the series especially once you learn how to use them. For example, there are a few different city state types such as maritime, cultured, military. If friends, maritime gives you food bonuses in your civ, cultured gives culture bonuses and military will send you free units from time to time. So the option is there if you want to conquer them, friend them, or ally them. If you ally them you get the bonuses plus all the resources they have. Next, units cost strategic resources to build. For example, if you have 5 oil and build a bomber, you will have 4 oil left. So having multiple resources finally makes a difference. You can trade them away or use them all.

Right away I noticed the game has probably the best sounds of combat I have ever heard in a game.  From the sounds of weapons firing to the sounds of armored vehicles running, the game is great to listen to.  The sounds of mortar shells coming down and exploding around you is just unbelievable.  When I walk through forests and fields, I can actually hear the sounds of birds chirping, dogs barking, and cows mooing.

  The graphics in the game are just great too.  I love looking at the water in streams and rivers.  It looks very real.  The forests and villages in this Eastern European setting are really beautiful to look at in this game.

I like how you can jump in different vehicles to drive around in and there is a car radio in the vehicle to listen to while you are driving around.  There are several different radio stations to listen to.  I love the music in this game.

The AI in this game is pretty smart.  When enemy soldiers see me, they immediately run and hide behind something.  They have try to out flank me and they have tried to sneaked behind me a few times. I love the part where a enemy soldier runs into a building to hide from you and you can use your weapon to blow a good size hole into a building to waste the enemy soldier. It is also so much fun to just take your weapon and shoot down all the trees that enemy soldiers are hiding behind.  You can do so much damage to the terrain with your weapons in this game.

The maps to this game are huge.  The maps are ten times bigger than the maps to Call of Duty 4.  I love the sandbox settings to this game where you can go any where on the maps.

Its the purest form of an RTS I have ever seen, with 4 tiers of construction and monster super weapons. It also has nukes that actually detonate like real nukes, something I haven't seen in other RTS games, where you usually get ridiculously wimpy explosions. The game pace is fairly slow and steady, which allows for alot of time to develop strategy and try different tactics. On the biggest maps, a single game will take up to 2 hours, which is pretty impressive for a non-Civ style RTS. (Obviously games like Rise of Nations, AOE, and Empire Earth were made to take longer) The computer AI starts out pretty slow, and on small maps it can be defeated pretty easily. Once it gets going though on larger maps, it is downright vicious, and will pummel you mercilessly.
Developing your economy in a balanced way is crucial, as resources are drained steadily, instead of a lump sum cost paid when you build something. Start too many construction projects, and it will bog down to where nothing will get built. Also, you have to constantly increase your economy throughout the game, as opposed to other RTS games, where this is primarily accomplished early on. Building tier 3 power plants and mass fabricators continuously toward the middle and latter part of the game is vital.
This game has the largest scope of any RTS I have seen, and this is its only weakness. Toward the end of the game on large maps, the units will start getting very sluggish, and a long lag time creeps up on issuing build orders. It can get extremely irritating when you see a superweapon slowly moving toward you and can't throw up defenses quickly because your units are just sitting there. I found this can be averted by individually selecting units and issuing commands, although that can be kind of annoying.
The games has 3 difficulty settings, though I find battling two AI's on maximum difficulty to generally be about as much as I can handle. There is a bit of a learning curve in figuring out all the little ways to speed up your production, but once you get it down, the battles become truly epic.",The ultimate RTS,1271289600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

My biggest gripe with the game is that constant references are made to the world of Innocent Sin -- however, by watching the included trailer and through the events of Eternal Punishment, you'll get a good idea of what happened in the earlier game.
With a somewhat contemporary setting, Eternal Punishment is an oddball in the world of RPGs. That doesn't mean, however, that it's bad! On the contrary, it's a superb game with deep gameplay. In battles, you can kill the demons, like in ordinary RPGs, or you can negotiate with them for money/items/information/tarot cards (the last of which is used to summon more Personae, facets of the user's personality which can be summoned to fight for them).
The characters are interesting and more adult than your typical spiky-haired teen heroes. They range from reporter Maya and policeman Katsuya to computer hacker/wiretapper Baofu and fashion model Ellen (from the first Persona). The innovative rumor system allows you to change the face of Sumaru City by spreading rumors. Want to buy weapons at your local bar? Spread the rumor that they are, and you can get a gun along with your martini.
My only other gripe, and it's small, is with the localization. Some of the text is a little stilted (Ulala's ""The goodness of a woman isn't in her bra!"" is a prime example). But considering the vast amount of text in this game -- and I mean VAST -- it's a very good localization overall, and in no way hinders your enjoyment of the game.

5.0,False,"03 8, 2009",AZVCNOOQK36DH,B000FQBF1M,DryvBy,"This is definitely Sony's answer to Halo. This doesn't mean Halo is a horrible game or anything, but Microsoft has Halo and now Sony can brag with it's Killzone.

Before going into the technical aspects of the game, I think it's key to discuss the controls and story. The controls, regardless of the endless complaints, are just fine. Anyone complaining about 'stiff controls' should know they could just go into their settings and up their sensitivity for the Y and X axis of their analog sticks. I increased it a tad and it's just fine to me. The turning is a little slower than games such as Call of Duty or Unreal Tournament, but it really adds a bit to the game. You're walking around in armor, you're not going to be able to turn around in a flash. I really hope they don't 'fix' what isn't broken.

The story is just like any other shooter game. It's not that good, but it gets the job done. In other words: it's story is that of a typical shooter. Without ruining anything, there's rescue/extract missions, protect an area missions, and the usual 'kill everything in this area' missions. But really, expecting some ground-breaking story from a shooter is saying that you've never played a shooter. Most of these stories are the same. It's just how they handle the gameplay.

The game really shines in a few key areas: graphics, audio, and gameplay. Starting with the graphics aspect, one of the first things you'll notice is how amazing this game looks and how smooth it runs. The only slow downs you'll encounter is from the loading times in between sections of a level (similar to that of Gears of War or any Halo game). These are only for a split second and have nothing really to do with graphics. This game not only looks good in it's textures and character models, but it has some of the best animations. For instance, shooting an enemy may drop him in what seems like an unscripted death sequence, but sometimes these guys will lay there ""dead"" and rise back up and start beating you from behind. This is a bit of the gameplay, I know, but the way they fall down and even get back up just looks really good. Another thing you'll notice is the extreme detail to wind, smoke, fog, dust, and lighting. A good example is watching fans shutter lights through them in some of the levels. Probably the only thing ugly about this game is the flamethrower's flame. It's fun to use, but a little bit dull as a flame in a gorgeous game like this.

The audio is really top notch. The developers must have worked a good amount of time perfecting 7.1 audio. Even on a 5.1 system, this game will sound like no-other. Twirling around while enemies flank your backside is seemless. This is one of the few games that my receiver picks up as DTS supported audio. The music is good an doesn't really drown out the action. Excuse me for using Halo as an example again, but the music plays out like the Halo series. You don't really even notice it's there until a huge even is showing up or when you begin fighting a boss. I personally hate music in some games, especially a shooter. But the music in this game is placed perfectly.

As for gameplay, it uses something familiar to us all: the cover system. Games without a cover system today seem a little left behind, unless there's a clean or something to make up for it. This game's cover system is a little unique, as it's similar to Gears of War or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, yet it manages to keep you in first person while diving into a wall. There's no camera moving into third person while leaning. I really liked this, as popping up to shoot really felt like I was in the action. Everything else is pretty similar to most of other games. There's a few new things, but mostly it's all similar to the popular shooters today. One thing to note is this game isn't limited to just a few guns. There's plenty of weapons to shoot foes with, such as shotguns, sniper rifles (which has a motion sensor function that actually works), rifles, and electric guns.

Multi player is currently up and down. While the gameplay itself is an amazing experience with 32 players per match, and plenty of players playing the game, the stat system is currently lacking a bit. Hopefully this will be padded out as it's annoying that bot killers have good stats, but again, this wil probably be fixed according to the developers of Killzone 2. There's a good amount of maps to keep you coming back for more, and enough good game modes to keep you here. Hopefully, more DLC (free) will head our way and pave the way for more shooters to keep their content free for their fans.

If you're planning on getting any game this spring, Killzone 2 should be it. This should help sell plenty of PS3's before the end of the year.",A Must-Have for Any FPS Fan,1236470400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I also like the amount of options you have towards what kind of racing you want to do (i.e. career, quick race, etc.). I also thought that the graphics were pretty much amazing for the PS2. I really liked the music and actually have bought two CD's by artists featured on the game. I like the different classes and types of cars. Also, I found the ""partner"" racing style to be pretty fun (although at times ineffective). Canyon races are always fun, and I play the game all the time even though I've already beaten it.

5.0,True,"07 9, 2013",A4YNFBWLNTV35,B007CSF3GO,Johng-Hun Goo,"When you hear the name Hironobu Sakaguchi, a few things come to mind: Final Fantasy, a subsequent brilliant legacy at Square, and usually traditional, strategic, turn-based combat. I was a bit skeptical about this game when it was revealed that it had a real-time battle-system. Fear not. This is a very fun, engaging, dynamic, and strategic battle-system that will make believers out of the most stubborn, control-freak traditionalists.

This feels like one of the earlier Final Fantasies, with its medieval fantasy backdrop of swords-and-sorcery. It also feels like an MMORPG, with its living, breathing city with various things to do and see. And it also feels like a modern, third-person action game in the ilk of Gears of War or Mass Effect. This meshing of styles may cause you to fear that the resulting game would be a discombobulated mess, but it actually results in a vivacious synergy that captivates the player and invites him or her to keep playing.

In the beginning, the game brought back memories of various games from my past - games like Vagrant Story, and Twilight Princess. However, as I played on, it developed an identity of its own. It became evident that the developers weren't following a premade formula for creating RPGs. They were simply creating a game that they themselves would want to play - one with a believable world, likable and relatable characters, fun battle-system, and an entrancing story.

Sakaguchi and Mistwalker, along with Nobuo Uematsu, AQ Interactive, Nintendo, and XSEED have brought us a true gem.

However, in the recent surge of ""realistic"" shooters, COD4 really seems to take the cake. The story mode is enthralling through most of the missions. If you haven't played many next-gen games before this, you'll likely play through the first mission with your jaw on the floor. The game looks very detailed and gameplay is smooth and entertaining.

Even as good as the one-player missions are, the real reason for buying this or most shooters is for the online play. You'll find plenty of opponents waiting online in one of the many gameplay types. Online games range from 4-18 players depending on the mode, and it has a big effect. Smaller games will make you feel a little more adrenaline because you don't know where the next enemy is going to jump out. Some of the bigger games can be a little more laid back, and make it easier to play without be afraid of dying.

The interface of the game is well-made, controls are smooth, even if they may take a few plays to get used to, and sounds and visuals are realistic for the weapons and maps. This is not a game where you can run straight through the middle of a field and come out on the other side alive, since 3-4 bullets from many guns will kill you. That said, a lot of the games will require you to out-think your online foes, or at least be quicker to the draw.

This Game of the Year edition of COD4 comes with (I believe) 4 extra maps in a ""map pack"", a $10 value for free. This was not a breaking point for me in the purchase, but some of them are pretty cool. When you enter the code in the Playstation Store and download the maps, you then install them to the HDD and they are immediately playable in split-screen and online modes. They are all pretty fun to play, but if you can find COD4 without the GOTY distinction for a cheaper price (I'd say at least $10) go ahead and pick it up. The extra maps aren't really used enough to be necessary.

All in all, it's the best shooter in terms of realism I've played to this point, and I'd recommend this game for anyone who enjoys shooters (with a little strategy) or anyone who likes military games, because this game immerses you in military lingo and strategy, especially in the solo missions.",One of the Best Shooters Out There,1216166400,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"12 21, 2011",A2SJ9PZMSU7AF0,B0054IN5RI,RagingStormX,"So a little backround on me. I have been playing fighters since I could grab an arcade stick, been playing tournament level players for 12 years, and currently play Super Street Fighter 4 AE ver 2012 and plenty of old school games to include Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo.

That being said this is not a review by a random person who casually plays games.

First and foremost is the content. SNKP packed so much in this game that it feels like a actual game unlike KOF 12 which was a huge disappointment. The story mode is full of hand drawn moton comic type scenes with plenty of story. Arcade mode is included which is standard in any fighter. There are trial modes which give you some of the best combos for each character similar to what Street Fighter 4 introduced and well as a basic tutorial explaining the basic system.

You can unlock Billy Kane and the boss character through playing the game as well as download Iori and Kyo alternate versions. Mr. Karate DLC should be coming in the near future. There is a color edit mode similar to Capcom vs Snk 2. This allows you to color any character the way you want, being able to save up to 5 custom edits per characters. You unlock more colors by playing story mode.

The game itself looks beautiful. The characters are fluid and backrounds are gorgeous. Much improvement over KoF 12. No longer does the game zoom in like in the last installment as well. The overall menu design and presentation is done well.

The actual gameplay is a blast. King of Fighters is a more offensive based game than Street Fighter. Everything compliment offense. There are rolls, low jump, hyper low jumps, hyper jumps, guard bar, special cancels, super cancels, neo max cancels, and custom combos. You can pull off crazy combos in this game. The overall combo system in the game is fantastic. Unlike SSF4, you cannot cancel a special move unless it's hitting. So no one can uppercut then cancel to safety, you will get punished for your mistakes. Of course the staple in KoF games, you can combo grabs, which is something I find very unique.

Online play I have done research on through Shoryuken.com. 4 bar connections are amazing (like they are at your house), 3 bar connections are playable, 2 bars is bad, 1 bar is roflomgnowhy. Mostly there are 2/3 bar connections depending on distance. That being said don't let that deter you from buying this amazing game. SNKP and Atlus have announced that they are patching the game to vastly improve online performance. This game seems to be as good currently online as Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3.

With over a roster of 30 highly enjoyable characters (such as Kyo, Iori, Mai, K, Terry, as well as other fan favorites), a complex deep yet easy to grasp combo system, standard KoF mechanics, good online play, as well as a vast amount of content this game get 5/5. SNKP out did themselves, but the fans deserve no less. This game is what KoF 12 should have been. If you been waiting for a good KoF game to get into THIS is it.

Edit: This game comes with a 4 CD soundtrack of all KoF games which is a plus. Also this game was rebalanced from the original arcade version (making it better).

Gameplay 5/5
Sound 5/5
Content 5/5
Roster 5/5
Replayability 5/5
Tutorials 5/5
Online play 3.5/5 (Note this is getting patched to vastly improve and it good most the time, but bad connections are bad)

He is mad about the 1.08 patch because its unfair to people who don't have the expansion and i can kind of see his point. But he needs to realize that he will not be happy either way. If he had the expansion he would complain about how all the monsters are to easy and the game is no longer fun. So i think Blizzard was right to make that patch.
But anyway, Lord of destruction is a big improvement over the first for a couple of reasons. One being the options you have for your mercenary helper guy/girl. in the original you coudn't do anything and it wasn't worth it. But now thanks to the Expansion you can heal, give weapons and armor, even resurrect your helper which I think is great!  The second good thing over the oringinal is, jewels and runes. They are great! They help so much and give alot of cool new magic to your socketed items. Last and not least is the new characters. Some argue that the price is to much for just two more characters and one more act and i admit the the last act did kind of [stink], except for baal (final boss). but i have come to love the assasain to much to go back to regular old necromancer, trust me i've tried. as for the druid i like him a great deal too!

There is a map that you move around and pick which place to fight or you can even visit the villages to talk to people, buy upgrades, equipment, and so on. There are also little mini challenges scattered throughout the map as well.

This game is pretty addicting and I am close to beating it my first time. The levels are different and unique for every level which adds a nice variety to the game and makes it never get boring. Also there are traveling people that move around the map and you can fight them if you want. There are lots of upgrades as well. You can get different armor, upgrade your shovel, upgrade your health and mana, find relics that help you out, and find music sheets scattered throughout the world that give you money when turned in.

There are also challenges that you need to accomplish which I will probably never do them all. Some are beating the game without dying, beating the game in 1 hour and 30 minutes (I'm on my first play through and I'm at least 5 hours in), don't spend any money(ha ya right), and other fun challenges. This game has lots to offer and the developers add free updates which add lots to the game( I think the last update added plague knight as a playable character after you beat the game, but I haven't beat the game yet to confirm that).

The story is that your trying to save shield knight from the enchantress. The enchantress has bosses blocking the way and you need to defeat them all in order to move on.

Great sound wheel, very easy to control windows' audio levels.

( and still do )  Back in the hay day of 2D games Sonic R was the first full 3D sonic game on the Sega Saturn, there was the hub world in Sonic Jam but that was only a part of the game. In general, I love racing games and Sonic R is not a normal racing game at all! It was brought to us by Yuji Naka and the Sega Team in 1997 and I still find it to be a great game even today. I remember buying it in 1998 two or three months before the demise of the Sega Saturn. ( a tear drops from my eye! ) The powers that be and the Nintendo Fan Boys pretty much poo-pooed it because they were comparing it to Mario Kart, ( an awesome game ) but it's not the same type of game. In Sonic R the emphasis is on jumping, exploring, collecting rings, the multiple tracks and finding all the hidden areas the game has to offer. The worlds are similar in looks to early Sonic games and that's always a good thing for us Sonic lovers. The game moves along at a fast 30 fps, and the worlds are well drawn and colorful. The music is so happy and bouncy it can be a bit overwhelming at times, but it is well written and it fits the overall feel to the game. I love the fact that you can control the weather in the game. If you choose snow, you can run on top of the frozen water instead of sinking, and that's cool! ( no pun intended ) The control took me a bit to get used to, but on the 3D controller ( or my fighter stick ) it makes it much nicer to play. There are Ten playable characters, five to start, there is: Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy and Dr. Robotnik! There are also five unlockable players: Dr, Robotnik's Egg Robo, Metal Sonic, Metal Knuckles, Tails Doll, and Super Sonic. ( very fast! ) All in all I rate this game a five because I love everything sonic, ( almost ) ( Sonic Spinball not so much ) but it really is a fun stand alone racing game in it's own right! It's different, but different is always good in my books! Sonic R for the Sega Saturn should be an important part of every SS library.

1. Gameplay had a better pace. (But you'll adjust to Brawl's in time)

2. No one seemingly tripped for no reason lol. (Doesn't happen much but can unfairly get you murdered lol)

Besides that, Brawl has by far more stages, more characters, more unlockables, destructive environments, better music, cooler moves, a story mode (are you kidding me?!), online, a stage creator, it doesn't seem to end. This game is jam packed with things to do and you can do it alone or with a friend. I personally REALLY enjoyed story mode lol. It's not like the stage/dungeon thing Melee had, which was good, but this has a more in depth story line with some good length, tons of challenges, and lots of fun. Online was a disappointment though. Too much lag. My Mario Kart never lags, this does, and BAD. If this wasn't a 4 player offline game It would have stunk because of the online but since Smash never really needed online to be fun before, it doesn't affect you much.

My review will be short because others have already touched on points I would have included here. Now, I like that you can start a combo and have others jump in to finish it. Also, there are the Super Cancels and Dream Cancels. What that means is that certain moves can be combined (canceled) with more powerful moves to really destroy your opponent. These two points alone set it apart from the other KOF games. You also have many characters to choose from. There is a great Challenge mode that can test your skills and unlock other characters.

The A40's were good, but like I stated the mic is crap, truly. I also noticed after using the Hyper X clouds the highs and mids are cleaner, along with the bass, it's more accurate. The A40's had powerful bass, but they got a little muddy and overpowering, drowning out the highs and mids which are important if you play FPS's, which is what I play 90% of the time. I also own the TB stealth 400's, which are fine wireless cans, the mic is very good too, but the sound is just a tad too soft for me, to hear the little nuances and details like footsteps you need to get a wired pair and an amp and unfortunately the Astro mixamp is the only option for gamers using PC headsets and/or headphones. The mixamp does the job, but it is true that it will make any mic sound worse, but I will say the mic on the Hyper X's sounds decent with the mixamp. They are comfortable as well, they don't get hot unless you plan to wear them all friggin' day, in this case take them off for 2 minutes and you're good. The value with these things are tremendous, the accessories and the quality make this a must buy.",Don't mess with the others - True Value,1433808000,,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Style:': ' Headset'}",

5.0,False,"11 20, 2004",AAY4CI53G2LM7,B00009WAUK,just me,"After playing the original FFT on Playstation, I can say this game lives up to the challenge of recreating the same environment on the Gameboy Advance. Looks incredible....graphics are crisp/well-defined, there are large battlefields to explore, and spells look better than the Playstation. While there is a huge job system, it is not complex to learn or master. With over 300 battles to play, you can rush to the end and miss many items to come back later. In that regard, the replay value is very high. Even if you find every single item, I'd say the length of the game (40-120 hours) can more than make you forget a few places you've been.

Now a gripe I have is with the music. It can wear on you after awhile. I tend to enjoy good battle music, but the in game music drags and very often you might spend 5 minutes before a battle changing your characters' jobs & skills around. Don't want to have bad music there, as it can take away from the skills you'll need for the upcoming battle.

There are many unique attributes to the game, including to effect a battle using an item you previously won (or found) on a Mission. The environments still play a huge outcome in how the battle progresses. I like the whole idea of the recon/item missions. You could send a weak character out to pick up a rare item and their stats will come back improved. Later on, you can only find the rarest items by sending one powerful character out on the recon/item missions.

SquareEnix RPG's are well-known for their epic stories. Does not apply here. The entire game (**spoiler ahead**) is focused on the main character's ability to stop his brother from keeping him trapped inside a fantasy world. So you'll meet up w/ your little brother, have a few words, maybe fight a battle, and then you go about your recon/item missions. There are plenty of epic battles, but the story here lags a bit. I still give FFT high praise for its handling of subjects not often expressed in an RPG.

FFT: Advance has been called a 'kiddie RPG'. Not true. It's not Mortal Kombat...yeah... but it stands up to other RPG's on GBA and many on PS2 & GameCube. You'll find challenge, good music, many hours of play and an overall sense that you enjoyed yourself once you reach the ending (which is a bit predictable in my mind ;)

Pros: Incredible graphics, characters have personalities all their own, somewhat challenging battles, over 300 missions, cool LinkUp play, very good replay value

Cons: In game music gets a bit old after awhile, your characters are too darn powerful (challenge goes way down the more you build them up), music drags (again), not many LinkUp capabilities.

Play this if you liked: Golden Sun 2 or any Square RPG.

On a 10 point scale, I give this game 8/10 overall.","(not a Square fanboy, OK??) A StrategyRPG for your wishlist!",1100908800,,,

5.0,False,"11 4, 2009",A3TTKMUH9REXNH,B001IK1BWC,Christopher Perry,"First and Foremost I have to say that the PC version Graphics and facial Animation Details in this game are stunnig and awesome....I was deeply impressed it made me feel like i was watching a interactive movie.

Secondaly, For those who aren't to thrilled with EA titles, know this, BIOWARE was the sole Developer on this project, EA is merely the Publisher. BIOWARE is the developer of Mass Effect,  Star Wars Kotor1, Neverwinter Nights 1, Jade Empire, Baldurs Gate series. These games were all game of the year winners. So hopefully this will encourage you to try this game out.

Ok so...the game itself. If you are not a gamer who likes to immerse yourself in a very deep dynamic game system this game Is NOT for you...the are alot of abilites, functions, and aspects to this game...so if you are a Call of Duty or Halo guy/gal....you'll prolly just get confused with this game. However, if you Liked Mass Effect, Jade Empire and Neverwinter Nights then this game is a perfect addition to the Bioware collection.

Video/graphics: simply put for PC they are amazing, especially the facial expressions the NPCs make are stunning and refreashingly authentic. the Gore/violence effects are pretty cool..if you don't like all the blood you can just reduce the effect in the options menu. And finally errors, i have had zero graphics issues or errors while playing this game, no jumpy frame rates or lag issues of any kind...i have to say the graphics engine was very well done by the development team. I am using a Nvidia 8800 GTX card with all video settings maxed so i do have a advantage using a higer end card but there are better ones out there. I highly recommend if you get the PC version you have a system that can handle the high needs of this game or you won't get to experience the game to its full capability, you prolly should just get the Xbox version instead.

Gameplay: ok so be aware this is a True RPG like Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter Nights 1, so if you are use to Mass Effect/Jade Empire third person shooter/action style this is not the same. while all actions take place in real time the action squences are very strategic in nature, especially in high diffifulties. for example...Similar to Final Fantasy 12, Dragon Age has a system called tactics, which are preset settings you can unlock to make command and control for your party easier. like you can have your mage and ranged characters preset to auto attack any other ranged or mages, and your tank auto set to tank any high damage dealing classes. At low difficulty levels you can just make these changes on the fly with minimal resistance but when playing the challenging hard or Nightmare difficulties you will not succeed without using the tactic system or using the pause before combat option(so you can prepare your strat). Oh yes, the pause before combat option, in the settings menu you can set the game to auto pause when you are engaged in combat, this is highly recommended to players who use the harder difficulties so you can issue your orders to your party members before any damgage is dealt. Another cool aspect is the combo system...once you get certain abilties you can chain several melee or magic abilties together to create a combo that will unleash massive damage or specail effects. Also, be aware Almost all true RPGs have Friendly fire settings for hard difficulties which obviously means, that the big fireball you just shot into the middle of your friends and bad guys killed the bad guys, but prolly just killed your friends too, and the only way to turn off friendly fire is to play EZ mode and makes the game far more challenging, so again strategy is very important. Lastly this game features a ""Influence/Moral"" system, where the choices you make in the game affects the demeanor of your party members toward you. if you manage to gain high influence with certain characters a romance plot maybe accessible or if too low they may eventually abandon you altogether. Also the choices you make and the influence you have with your party will affect the final part of the game so be careful you could find your self betrayed at the end if you show bad judgement with your party members and the choices you make.

Story: this game consists of Six Origin Stories, each origin story is unigue to your race and class so to truly somplete the game you are highly encouraged to paly through all the classes and races. Some people find this time consuming, but me I Find it fun and highly detailed story. Also Each Origin Story changes the overall ending of the game...just fyi. Since at the time of the review the game has only been out for a day...I have only had time to play the Human Noble Warrior aspect of the game and am still not done, maybe half way through. which leaves me with 5 other Origin Stories to explore later.

So here are the ratings for each Aspect of the game 5 out of 5 ratings.

I didn't buy this console until December 2000 as a combination Christmas present for myself and my cousins.  It's unfortunate that shortly after that Sega essentially disowned the machine.  They are still developing for it, but that action had an effect on the development houses outside of Sega.  That's not to say that everyone but Sega is jumping ship, though.
There are a lot of fantastic games that look as good or nearly as good as the PS2 (which I also have).  And to be completely honest, I enjoy the Dreamcast more now because of the wealth of fantastic games it has to offer.  In time, I'm sure the PS2 will catch up and surpass the Dreamcast, but right now the Dreamcast is the machine that offers the most fun for your dollar, by far.
Bottom line, excellent graphics, excellent sound, online games, and hundreds of excellent titles to choose from for all ages.

There are practically no easy battles in the later dungeons, you've always got to be on your toes and think one step ahead. Item management plays a central role.

This is my first roguelike, and although I've not played one before, I can tell that it's the real deal, not a ""roguelike on training wheels"" as some were fearing. While you can keep your levels for most of the main story, the post-game dungeons are a different story. And even when only your items are lost upon death, it's still more challenging than 95% of RPGs out there. (I should mention, though, that it's never challenging in a frustrating way. There's always a drive to go right back into that dungeon you just died in and try again.) No two dungeon trips are ever the same, so the game looks to be endlessly replayable.

I believe Chunsoft have accomplished what they probably sought out to do: Satisfy the hardcore roguelike faction while also opening doors to the general RPG fan.

I have tried a couple of other keyboards in this category including the Steelseries M500 and I have to admit, I am impressed.  I went through a several month test period with this keyboard before getting around to writing this.  I've used it for FPS games and an MMO.  I then took it to work and have been using it for that purpose ever since.
Pros:
Solid build as you'd expect from a Corsair product.
It's an absolute pleasure to type on and the Cherry MX Red switches won't earn you glares from others around you for using a clicky keyboard.
The keyboard has media keys and a brightness button.
The keys actually feel good to type on with, to me, the perfect amount of tactile feedback.
The wrist rest shown on the Amazon page is comfortable, but detachable if you do not need it.  I noticed in the QA section it states the keyboard does not come with a wrist rest.  Mine did.
It is spill resistant and easy to clean. This is a fact I actually would have likely forgotten to mention if one of my co-workers hadn't knocked over my iced tea on to it.
Cons:
It has a larger footprint than the M500 even with the wrist rest detached.
There are no USB ports for those who like the convenience of having a mouse fob or thumb drive on the keyboard.
If you want the Corsair utility engine, you will have to download it from the site as it does not come with the keyboard.

I can't say that this keyboard would be better for everyone as a work keyboard over a gaming one, but for someone like me who is at my workstation considerably longer per day than at my gaming rig, you may want to take it to work and give it a try.  For me it's good for gaming but even better to just type on.",The best sub $100 mechanical keyboard I have tried thus far.,1508284800,,{'Format:': ' Personal Computers'},

5.0,False,"06 24, 2016",AHAW6FFH93KGE,B01CKGI0TO,Jay Jay,"No this isn't the Shin Megami Tensei x Fire Emblem people were expecting. It is a quirky, fun RPG that does what it sets out to do and be really well and if you like JRPG series from Atlus like Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Survivor ect, then you need to give this game a try. You do NOT have to have prior knowledge of either Fire Emblem or Shin Megami Tensei to enjoy the game. The familiarity is mostly just for the battle system but the game explains this very well.

First off, yes there is a lot of J-pop in this. Special attacks have singing and dance routines embedded into them but they're actually quite fun to watch. And despite what you might hear, this isn't just about idols. It's more of the entertainment industry as a whole. There are characters that want to be actors, voice actors, stuntmen ect so there's a lot of variety. The story itself is pretty lighthearted and like a coming of age story for the characters (if you're an anime fan it's like a slice of life anime) so not as dark as some other Atlus RPGs

While it may not look like Fire Emblem or SMT, the elements of those games when it comes to the battle system are meshed together extremely well. Your FE characters are the mirages (you can think of them as a persona if you've played the Persona series). You inherit skills from them (SMT/Persona skills like Dia, Zio ect). If you hit an enemy weakness you'll get the chance to perform a session attack (group attack). The Fire Emblem weapon triangle applies in battle. The game has multiple difficulty settings from easy to hard and then you can unlock Lunatic after you complete the game once. The game has a good deal of challenge to it and some enemies will be able to one shot you if you play on hard.

This game makes great use of the Wii U gamepad. It doubles as both a map and as your cell phone. It's based off the LINE App in Japan (the equivalent here would be Skype or Snapchat). On this messenger app you can talk to your friends, get to know them better and progress through the story and character side stories (a little like Social Links/Support Log). You can control the game itself using the Pro controller but you MUST have the gamepad for the messenger app. It's Japanese voices with English text just so you're aware.",Keep an open mind and you'll love it.,1466726400,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii U'}",

There are many different modes start with such as story mode, online mode, tournament mode and challenge mode. Street fighter 4 is a good fighting game worth playing. There are a number of mechanics that long time fans would have to learn and remaster in order to understand the gameplay. Each character has a variety of normal attacks and Special Moves to take advantage and one of my favorite part about Street Fighter IV is the Focus system, which allows a character to charge up an attack that will knock the opponent down if it connects properly. Players who want to get more into the technical key of it all will learn that the Focus Attack can also absorb incoming attacks which can gives the player a better edge during an online match. In this way, the Focus Attack becomes a defensive technique as well as an offensive one. There are two meters that can be used in a match: the Super meter and the Ultra meter. The Super meter fills as you land attacks and the Ultra meter goes up as you're getting hit. You can use the Super meter to execute Super Combos that can be chained together to bring your enemies health faster. On the other hand, you can use the Ultra meter for an Ultra Combos which are more devastating attacks that can change the fight to win easily. Overall good game and i give it a 9.0 for being a unique fighting game and enjoy playing it with friends.

It well-polished and clean, with PS3 and 360 versions which are both the same. Funny animated cutscenes should be change to story-telling.

The story revolves around a land known as Oros.  There are 3 tribes vying for control of Oros:  the Wenja (which is your tribe), the Udam & the Izilla.  The Udam are what you would normally think of as 'caveman' types.  The Izilla are much more technologically advanced than the Udam and they have a fetish for incendiary weapons.

Do you really need to read a review of this game to go out and buy it now?  Believe the hype: this is a fantastic game in its own league.  The only other game that approaches in scope is GTAIII.  While The Getaway has elements of it, it doesn't have anywhere near the detail, fun and unmatchable replay value built into Vice City.
The pros are too many to list.  Suffice to say if you loved III, you'll love this.  Much of the look and feel and control remains the same but with some improvements.  The graphics are sharper and more detailed.  You can actually walk into some of the interiors for missions, hideouts, etc., and you can go anywhere with tons of rooftop access, underground garages, countless twisting alleys for escape.  The colors are a gorgeous wash of
pastels and bright sun and that literally bleed on the screen sometimes.  You can also turn off the graphic ""trails"" in the Options menu to give the game a sharper, grittier look.
It's a prequel to III, with your main man, Tommy Vercetti, getting sent down to Vice City (a good Miami stand-in) to do what he does best.
Some of the new stuff:
Motorcycles - Five different types.  Takes time to get used to but Insane jumps are incredible.  Quite possibly worth the price of admission alone.
More Weapons: Now you can use a Katana blade, M-60, a chain saw, etc.
Character changes: Your character now has a name, a personality, a voice (supplied by Ray Liotta), and can change outfits (love the track suits).
The City: Is big, quite a different layout than the original, and includes islands, a golf course (complete with golf cart and plaid wearing 9 iron victims), businesses you can buy and earn with, the Cheesy Crust Pizza Co, etc.
Other stuff: Not to mention helicopters (a perfect match for the series), more lazy, bumbling cops, more radio (the soundtrack alone is a big achievement, including dozens of licensed 80s classics).
Complaints?  I have to nitpick, but there are a couple.  The city seems to empty of people and cars at certain times, but then again it's supposed to be South Florida, so the rain and storms scatter the people about.  Also, there are way fewer gangs than the original, and they're nowhere near as dangerous as the ones in III were.  The gangs (mostly Haitians and Cubans) do, however, love to hang out in groups, making them much easier
and more fun to run over.
Naturally, I wouldn't let small kids near this thing.  No way.  These games are in a class by themselves.  You get to interact with people and surroundings like never before.  The people on the streets have literally thousands of different sayings, and you can play for months before hearing or seeing new things.
I think Vice City is a little bit easier than III, but it's still a challenge.  Overall, this is a major achievement and
does not disappointment.

It wasn't bad, but lacked the flair Modern Warfare II had. I purchased Ghosts and regretted buying it shortly after playing it for a few days especially after purchasing a season pass! I needed a Call of Duty fix so I gave Call of Duty Black Ops II a try after putting it off for over a year. I must say, I prefer this over Ghosts any day!

It's pretty standard Call of Duty minus the HUGE maps that Ghosts offers. Activision tried to implement a Battlefield style tactics and play in a 6 v 6 matchups in Ghosts. Huge maps with only twelve players is a HUGE FAIL! Black Ops II, however, has some of the best maps I've ever played in the Call of Duty lineup.

Black Ops II still has the *token* system that Black Ops had which I didn't like. I much preferred Modern Warfare 2's system of upgrading weapons but all the installments after it changed to a *token* unlock system. Not terrible, but can be annoying if you buy a useless weapon and have to earn tokens to get a decent weapon, so you might want to research the internet about the guns before you throw your tokens away at some useless weapon.

All in all, I definitely am glad I purchased this and feel lucky that I bought the season pass for $24.99 when it was on sale on Xbox Live. Doesn't quite take the bitter taste out of Call of Duty Ghosts, but at least I have something I enjoy playing now! If you haven't purchased Call of Duty Ghosts nor Black Ops II, I highly recommend you skip Ghosts because you will be frustrated to no end with it. This is a better overall purchase and the price plummet of Ghosts and price increase of Black Ops II indicates that.",Skip Call of Duty Ghosts!,1397520000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This slight difference from other similar types of games definitely makes it an enjoyable experience. I actually purchased the season pass (which I rarely do) because I was hooked.

It does make me wish i had a Xbox so i could fully experience my influence from game one to game three.  that said still loving it.

The Collector Edition is almost worth $79, for the $10 mission DLC (encluded in the collectors edtion) makes the standard edtion $70. Plus the book and very pretty metal case are both nice touchs.

Story: Great, and yes it's much darker.  but feels right for how the story has progressed thus far.  Side quest are also a plenty, and many different new and old characters to talk to.

Sound: Voice acting is as great as ME2.  the music is a nice touch for the cinematic scenes, but ofter underscored in the rest of the game.

Graphics: If you thought the demo looked bad, then you be happy to hear that really the worst looking level i've been to is the level in the demo.  The foreground usually looks good, on par with ME2, nice lighting and textures, fully rendered 3D visuals, but anything in the background is often 2D animations.  If you want an example, in the demo or first level look at the ground, you'll see people running out of the building in 2D animation like a 'metal slug' game.  Luckily most of the following levels aren't in as grand of a scale so the visuals look fine.  But definitely looks like a outdated engine.

Combat: Same as ME2, but will agree with other reviews that going into cover is often clunky. there is more of a emphasis on melee combat in this game though. fun but nothing not done in other games, and done better.

RPG Elements: much stronger in this game, lots of Weapon modifications, Suit and Money that make sense.  always felt the money in ME2 didn't have a purpose.  Leveling can be done at anytime, which is really nice as I'm a compulsive leveling person.  and you get Exp for doing everything, even opening the door will sometimes give you 150Exp.

Character Import: Worked fine, i started at level 25 and leaved up from there. The character does look slightly different from my ME2 game, so i had to tweak her a little. but interestingly she does look a little older in this game.  Took a little to get used to, but neet effect.

Collector Edition Stuff:  All the DLC imported fine and seemlessly, not like ME2 which made my PS3 laggy.  The robat dog is not as cool as i thought he'd be. It just walks around the bottom floor.  And i could for the life of me figure out how to get the Soundtrack to download off the bioware website so i had to torrent something i alread own.  very anoying.  The Book, is really nice, well made, but it does contain spoilers so be warned.

Glitches: Some frame rate, texture popping, and some times during cinematic scenes people will just appear.  but nothing game breaking for me.  Hasn't frozen once, but it has stuttered.

Conclusion: If you played ME2 then get this game, That said if you haven't played ME2, pick that up first or you'll be totally lost.  The collector edtion is really $9 more then the standard edition if you'll be getting the extra mission DLC anyways.

Graphics 10/10:

Simply amazing provided you have the system to run it. I am running it on a 4870x2 and a Quad Q6600 overclocked to 3.6GHZ, so I can run it nicely at 1920x1200 8xAA Ultra High settings overrall. Grass, Trees, and the environment are rich in detail. Simply put, this game has awesome graphics. All the character models are rich in detail and very realistic looking. I've played both Crysis and Crysis Warhead, and the graphics in Far Cry 2 are far superior, and more importantly, are much more optimized and run a lot smoother.

Gameplay 9.5/10:

Here is where it becomes a hit or miss for some of you. If you liked the Grand Theft Auto series style of gameplay and 1st Person Shooters in general, then you will love this game. The game is composed of a lot of missions, usually making you travel quite a bit, where you will encounter guard posts, and other random bad guys that tend to get you side tracked. There is plenty of action, but I think for some this can become a bit tedious, as they enjoy more of a story line rather than the typical run and gun missions. You can approach missions with a tactical mindset however, such as using a silenced sniper rifle to kill your foes from a distance, or a silenced pistol for close quarter combat without alerting the bad guys around you.

What will keep people interested and coming back for more is weapons and gear upgrades. As you complete missions, you gain more money, and purchase better weapons. It's a nice reward system that makes completing a mission much more sweeter.

Attention to Detail: 9/10
Weapons, Sounds, Explosions and Voice Acting

Lots of weapons to choose from. Sniper Rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launchers...you name it, this game has got it. The weapons themselves look great and sound realistic. A lot of people complain about minor details, like which side the ejection port is on, but really, most non-military types will not care or even notice these insignificant details. I say insignificant because it doesn't affect the look or playability of the game. The weapon sounds and explosions are quit a feat. If you got some good speakers with some bass, now is the time to use them. Voice Acting on this game is pretty good overrall, but it's in this area where I would have to ding at least one point. Some of the characters in this games sound a bit on the cheesy side.

Overrall Score: 9.5/10

Sumarry:

This game is a must buy if you love 3rd person shooters that are mission oriented and keep the game action packed. The gameplay will give people freedom as they can choose between different missions, making the game less linear than the Norm. Those who do not like the Grand Theft Auto series may be disappointed in the gameplay, wanting more story line and more direction.

5.0,False,"02 9, 2008",A74TA8X5YQ7NE,B00139WXCU,NeuroSplicer,"This is an EXCELLENT game that takes the galaxy civilization games a clear step further. Open-ended like a new science-fiction world and played as a seat-of-your-pants RTS game, this is a very intelligent hybrid that I greatly enjoyed.

In effect, SINS is a successful blend of the wonderful GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS and HOMEWORLD series, with a sprinkling of TOTAL WAR for good measure. This is NOT a turn-based civilization game, so expect a much faster pace. What this means is that while it maintains the characteristics of classic turn-based civilization games (exploration, expansion, exploitation and extermination), by relieving from the micromanagement tedium, it allows for an intense RealTime Strategy experience. Now, this probably may not appeal to turn-based purists, but I would advise an open mind: this is a good game.

This concept-blending is new, so expect a slow learning curve - it took me a number of ...false-starts to get the hang of it: after all, it plays like an RTS and (although simplified) it still has enough of turn-based features that need to be taken care of. The interface is simplified and informative at the same time, with info trees sliding out only when needed.

There are three different factions to choose from (financiers, technologists and psitecs) - yet, their differences focus mainly on research tree-branching and ship designs. What I did not like was that the ships of all three factions are effectively the same and their differences are only skin-deep. What I would have liked to find (and was disappointed to the point of withholding the 5th star for fun) was ship design and building! Remember how much fun was to design our own spaceships (from freighters to battleships) in GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS II? Well, no such luck here. Let's hope they keep it in mind when the patch gets prepared.

Quick and constant exploration is not only encouraged by a necessity if one wants to survive - let alone win. Spaceships built within a solar system cannot travel beyond it, unless using ""wormhole""-like singularities. This adds to realism but can stretch your finances to their breaking point - since only locally built ships can be used. Moreover, it makes really hard to locate the strategic points to either built defenses or focus an attack. The AI will constantly be bypassing your planning like the Maginot line - and leave you with such a French feeling...

The graphics (of all of backgrounds, planets and units) are very nicely done. I really liked the multiple afterburners tracing through space as a spaceship squadron was dopplering past my screen...And less-than-cutting-edge PC owners rejoice: even 4-5 years old systems can handle this game like a breeze!
What I truly appreciated was the realistic scale of things. Galaxies are much larger than star systems, which in turn are much larger than planets, which in turn are much larger than space stations...than spaceships and so on. How is this achieved? Excellent zooming!
SUPREME COMMANDER was the first game to introduce strategic zoom; however, SINS implements it much better and shows how it should had been done: from a galaxy to a single planet and to a single spaceship, zooming in or out firmly maintains the effectiveness of battle controls by grouping and simplifying the info-tiles as one zooms out. In SupCom, we had to chose between either discerning the units or moving ...info-tiles around the battlefield - not a bad first attempt, mind you. In SINS, one almost never looses perspective: ongoing battles, critical hotspots, or colony revolts are all easily identifiable in real-time.

On another note, SINS OF A SOLAR EMPIRE is a STARDOCK release which, yes, means their specialized installation utility. Nevertheless, this game hides no DRM or other intrusive security idiocy. Since trust and respect between a game publisher and its customers is a two-way street (and STARDOCK was willing to prove its friendship first), SINS deserves our support.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",IN SPACE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU END YOUR TURN...,1202515200,54,,

This year's CoD feels very polished, everything from jumping to climbing is very seamless and Sledgehammer did a great job building the game around the exo suit - when jumping near the edge of a building for example you no longer have to press ""A"" to climb, it will catch it automatically and climb for you, and it works very well.

There's a whole slew of customization options as well and the combinations seem endless.

The maps are of course built to accommodate the exo suit, and can be a confusing mess of a mosh pit at times, this is the only area of the game that needs improvement in my opinion. You're going to get shot in the back, often.

Perks are about the same as they've always been. Load outs now utilize a ""pick 13"" system similar to the Black Ops ""pick 10"" system.

Knifing in Advanced Warfare is, in my opinion, the best it's ever been in any CoD game to date. No 17 mile knife lunge, just very fast, accurate and smooth knifing. It really is satisfying. Sledgehammer nailed it.

Kill streaks are now score streaks like in MW3, and while different from what we've seen in the past still feel pretty familiar.

Overall, Sledgehammer made some bold moves and brought a whole new dynamic of gameplay, and they did it well.",everything from jumping to climbing is very seamless and Sledgehammer did a great job building the game around the exo suit - ..,1414972800,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I usually stick to Logitech, but after a string of them went bad on me after a a few months of use, I started looking into something more rugged.  I had once used a more rugged Logitech, but it would drop signal on me constantly and another brand, Plantronics, had an odd background buzz.  I have always been a fan of Corsair products and when I saw they made a wireless headset I decided to try it.

My thoughts, laid out simply:

Pros:

- Holds a signal over a fairly long range.  I've walked to the other side of the house and it's kept signal.
- Padded on the ears and over the head.  If worn for long periods of time it doesn't get too painful.
- Still usable while being plugged in to charge.
- Long battery life, I get 8-10 hours out of a full charge.
- Controls are nice.  Tape and hold a button on the earpiece to turn off and on, flip the microphone up to mute.

Cons:

- Headset is a little tight if you wear thick glasses.  I had to switch to some wire frames because the headset pinched my head a little too much.
- Microphone is very sensitive and picked up my fan until I bought some foam caps and covered it.  You can buy a pack on Amazon for six dollars or so though.

What's Not to Like: Getting used to the controller rather than a mouse/keyboard combo. Every home in America that has an Xbox should not go without Halo.  Microsoft acquired Bungie in order to get this game on Xbox, and after playing it, you can definitely see why. First off, you'll notice the somber music and graphics.  The graphics are amazing-as in better than what you've seen on a PC.  They are just incredible to look at and you'll drool in awe. Now, let's talk about the gameplay: in the beginning you'll awake from your cryo-sleep and you'll have to knock out the cobwebs by re-training your systems.  (What a great way to do a tutorial).  Then you'll see one of your fellow crewmen get killed as the evil Covenant troops overrun your ship.  Next you'll have to get off the ship, but of course the Covenant are after you-and boy are they smart.  You'll have other troops with you helping your cause and they actually protect you with covering fire and suppressing fire. You can hide behind obstacles and take cover, but in later missions, you are attacked from above so be careful.  You are only allowed two different weapons to carry at one time and boy you'll find a huge number of weapons to choose from, adding another strategic element to the game.  Grenades aren't considered a weapon so you also have them in your arsenal.  Weapons are as lame as an 'energy pistol' and move up to more impressive guns, such as a very cool sniper rifle that lets you zoom in up to 10x and really pick your targets. Of course you don't have to go in all guns a blazin', instead you can also sneak attack and take out some of the Covenant baddies.  The sounds these guys make can help you out in order to determine their location, especially with the bad guys I like to call clowns, and when you play the game, you'll see why I call them that. The levels of the game are incredibly deep and there's no one way to finish a level, which adds immensely to the replay value.  The game is very challenging as the Covenant soldiers don't act the same way twice, and I mean that in a good way: they react to where you are and what you are doing. Halo isn't just a first person shooter-in fact you'll also have to do a bit of driving of certain vehicles in order to get where you want to go.  The Warthog is a nice vehicle with one problem-the gun is in the back.  Since you can't be in two places at the same time, you should go on a quest and find some other troops that have crashed in the forest so they can operate the gun.
This is the great thing about Halo-the missions make a heck of a lot of sense and you'll enjoy your time playing it. While I enjoyed my time in a single player quest, a multiplayer split screen option is also available (sorry, no internet play yet).  Everything looked smooth and enjoyable in the cooperative mode as well.  You can link multiple players and Xboxes together using the system link, but I'm not sure how many will take advantage of this. Load times are very fast and you'll see the game auto save at various checkpoints which makes it a snap to stop and play again later. One of the biggest issues people have mentioned with any FPS on a console is ""Yeah, but it doesn't support a mouse and keyboard.."" The Xbox controller feels good in your hand and you'll find it very easy to play the game with.  The right trigger shoots, while the left trigger is your grenade button.  The left stick allows you to move while the right stick lets you look around.  It is very intuitive and not once during the game did I say ""I wish I had a mouse and keyboard.""

The game takes the concepts within Assassin's Creed world and puts them into a pirate adventure game. The game does an amazing job of interjecting some history as well into the game. The game features historical characters like Blackbeard and Benjamin Hornigold. Beside the history, the game looks great.

The pirates within the game are not cartoon versions like the ones we see on tv. The game goes to painstaking efforts to make the story grounded within reality. The game look amazing and has tons to do within the game. Their is alot of content within the game, including exploring island and having your own pirate crews. The even acts differently based on the decisions you make, this includes singing different songs based on the bounty you collect. This is a great game that you should pick up.

First, this is a great Xbox, it is virtually totally QUIET, as compared to the old Xbox systems.  Everything works perfectly on this system.  The only drawback is that you MUST purchase an internal hard drive for this system, or you will not be able to play a lot of games.  You would not have space to save the game data.  Do NOT count on the 4 GB flash drive for storing much of anything, as there is not enough space.  This is especially true in that you are not getting the true 4 GB of space, as per what exists with the majority of disks.  Part of the space is pre-allocated to the system, which is not available to you.  If you play 'Word of Tanks', and download that game to your new, 4 GB, internal drive, you are just about done for putting anything else on the drive.  This game takes close to 3 GB of space.  Now to the next item, the Turtle Beach X42 headset.  This is a dynamite headset which a lot of gamers love.  It gives you true stereo/surround sound, and chat capabilities, to make your game play awesome.  The problem is that the X42 requires an OPTICAL connection on the Xbox, which the 360 E does not have.  You need to get an adapter.  Turtle Beach has one, which has been out of stock for a good while.  Don't know if they have stopped making it.  Don't fret though, as you can buy a converter box from Amazon, which will make the X42 work with the Xbox 360 E.  It gives you an optical capability.  You may find this adapter here:

5.0,False,"11 24, 2010",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B00198PO5I,Raul G.,"I'll start by saying that I have no previous experience with the Mafia series. I played Mafia 2 only after a good friend purchased it on a whim and highly recommended it to me. Now after completing the game it has become one of my all-time favorite games. If GTA: Vice City was Rockstar's homage to Scarface; Mafia 2 is a homage to every mob/gangster movie ever made. If you're a fan of The Godfather movies, Goodfellas, Casino, Donny Brasco, Scarface or the like then you need to play this game! The story in Mafia 2 could easily be a major motion picture, it's that good.

Mafia 2 places you in the shoes of Vito Scaletta a boy who's parents emigrated to the USA - specifically the fictional city of Empire Bay (fashioned after NYC) - from Sicily. Vito finds himself with the choice to either become a regular working stiff like his old-man or become a well-to-do wise guy. Vito chooses the latter and soon finds himself in trouble with the law. Facing either jail time or a stint in the Army, Vito chooses to fight Mussolini back on his parents home soil of Sicily during WWII. After being injured Vito takes leave to visit his family and soon runs into his childhood friend Joe Barbaro who uses his underworld contacts to arrange for Vito's permanent discharge from the military. This is where the adventure really begins and Vito and Joe set off to make something of themselves. My description only touches the first few moments of Mafia 2 and the story is much deeper and more engaging than I can hope to write concisely here. Think of Mafia 2 as the best of your favorite gangster movies only much longer and with you in control of the action and you'll get an idea of what the game is really like.

Gameplay is reminiscent of GTA only without the auto-targeting aspect. At its core Mafia 2 is a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter. Cover elements are a cross between GTA and Uncharted. The game takes place in 1940's - 1950's America so expect period guns (M1945, Tommy Gun's, shotguns); vehicles (not actual licensed cars but closely based on period autos); and clothing. The driving mechanics in Mafia 2 are in my opinion a vast improvement over the on-ice feel that the vehicles in GTA IV featured. Driving insane speeds is possible but expect a quick death if you crash (on hard difficulty anyway).

A major highlight of Mafia 2 has to be the graphics. This game is beautiful through and through. Mafia 2 initially begins in the winter time and through the story will transition to the summer. It's an incredible treat to see the developer take time to fully render the city in white/grey-scale snow & sleet setting and then see the change to a summertime setting with bright vivid colors. The care the developer has taken extends to the in-game physics too. Expect plenty of sliding about on the frozen streets of Empire Bay and more reasonable controls in the summer. Few games feature as much care in the graphics department as Mafia 2.

Unlike other open-world or sandbox games, the focus of Mafia 2 is the main story. Admittedly M2 is short on sidequests and minigames. This is generally a problem if you go in expecting a GTA clone. Mafia 2 is most definitely not that. Personally I found the focus on the story refreshing. Instead of distractions like pizza delivery missions or other time wasters Mafia 2 is about story driven events that include everything from jewelery store heists to covert missions planting explosives to assassinate a rival family member.

While I gave the game a 5-star rating there are some minor hiccups in the game. One disappointment for me would have to be the AI. Even on the highest difficulty setting AI controlled enemies are easily dispatched. Once you get a feel for the controls, escaping the police even at the highest wanted levels is insanely easy. It took a bit of the edge off for me knowing how easily I could shake the police. Despite that I feel that the game is a true 5-star title.

While Mafia 2 doesn't feature any type of online gameplay there are plenty of collectibles in-game including Playboy centerfold magazines (complete with nudity) and wanted posters to keep you occupied. Additionally 2K has released 3 DLC packs as of this writing that add significant replay value and give alternate perspectives to the story and to the mob's on-goings in Empire Bay.

The pedals certainly seem the same and the feedback and steering are pretty much the same.  So my guess is that the internals are the same but the interface is customized for the XBox One.

What this means is that for the price this is one hell of a good steering wheel.  I plugged it into my Xbox one and I was really pleased at how well the two integrate.  The TMX just shows up in the menus as another device in all the racing games I tried.  The feedback is very quiet yet powerful.
If you have ever used a T150 you will know exactly what you will be getting.  To compare it with my T300 would not be fair since the T300 is double the price, but I can say that it does not feel like I am getting half of the performance, it's really just a close second.

Overall very happy with it, I love how it has all the buttons that I would have on the controller, the pedals are stiff but not overly stiff.  The wheel itself is the standard 11 inch wheel and feels very comfortable.  The shifters are made of metal but everything else on the exterior is either plastic or rubber.  The desk clamp is pretty standard and works perfectly.  I really don's know if there is anything bad to say about this steering wheel package.  For the price it's a really good wheel and I would recommend it for anyone who is a casual to semi pro driver.

Well despite the negative criticism, I would have to say this game is one of the best co-op games out there for PS3. The gameplay is splendid and smooth, the graphics are phenomenal, replay value is awesome due to all the secret weapons you can unlock and mercenaries mode as well. Though I have to admit, the game is definately not scary at all but that really does not bother me at all. The story is not horrible, but it's not the best either. The one that thing that I have to complain about is how stupid the AI is. This game is definately made to be played with a friend online or off. The AI is a huge liability and only gets in your way. It is good for only 3 things - 1. Wasting all of your ammo  2. Finding a way to die so that you have to start over and 3. Pissing you off. But I have to admit, it is good with herbs and it will always heal you when the time comes.

Otherwise, you probably played 6 or 7 first and automaticaly judged this one as being ""kinda boring"" or ""Not as good as the newer FF games"". However, if you strip away the veneer of the newer predecessors and see what you have left, you will find that this possess most or all the things that make the later games good. Take away the androdgenous metrosexual young hero boys with amnesea, Big boobed and/or doey eyed love interests, terrible J-pop love songs, stupid or sexualized furby side characters, pointless CGI cutaway scenes, you have this game here.

What this does have is the bare basics.

Yes you can nitpick the gameplay in certain places. Buying potions 1 at a time. The way your party can attack a single enemy, kill the target and then strike dead air instead of the next enemy. The messed up and complicated magic system. The way airships can't land anywhere but flat grass. These are minor gripes that doesn't change the fact that this was a terrific game.

While we are nitpicking, let us remember some of the inovations Final Fantasy made to a genre. One big inovation it made to the whole D&D thing is that it simplified the battle stuff and made it fun for a wider audiance. Does anyone remember Dragon Quest/Warrior? This collapsed all the sub-menu Look/Search/talk/ect; mess into one easy button, (A).

The bottom of it is this, this game was inovative and fun for its time. It still holds a place deep in the hearts of those who ran with this franchise early on until the inevitable betrayal of Final Fantasy 7- present. If you have patients and enjoy a good nes title, play this. If you are graphically motived or like rehashed anime story lines, don't bother yourself.

In closing, this has monster replay value in that you can pick this up and dust it off and play it, even after years have passed. Are you planning on dusting off FF8 or Xeno-Gears this weekend? Didn't think so. That is how I judge what is classic. The ability to pick it up and start playing and immediately get into it.",This is the monster that we keep wanting new sequals to be.,1331856000,,,

5.0,False,"10 24, 2014",A3RQZ1J5F5G104,B00BGA9ZZ4,jomojomo,"This game is unique as it is a hybrid of racing sim and arcade racer.  Racing sims try to model the real world in terms of acceleration, tire grip, braking, etc.  They belong to the same category as flight sims.  Pure arcade racers don't care about reality, cars stick like glue, damage dosen't matter etc.  Games like Mario Kart belong in this category.  Both can be fun.

DC combines the two, which I love.  I don't want a pure sim because it is too much like work.  But neither to I want a game that is divorced from reality.  So with DC, you get a game with elements of the real world with enough arcade elements to keep things fun.

I haven't played a bunch of the online stuff because the company is working out the bugs in their online code, so if you are buying this game only for the online, you should wait and try the free version when it becomes available.  But I can heartily recommend the offline stuff if the sim/arcade hybrid idea appeals to you.

It is so nice driving through Canadian mountains, Scottish Highlands, rural India, ice covered Norway, etc.  It is beautiful.

Also, there is no in game purchases, like with GT6 and Forza 5.  In those games, they were always trying to sell you stuff in game, including $100+ cars.  So Kudos to the driveclub people for not putting that garbage in the game.

Finally, this is a game for people who just want to race.  There is no story, no 'you are so cool' positive reinforcement, and little in the way of exploding xp bars and level ups.","A Unique, Beautiful Sim/Arcade Hybrid",1414108800,10,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",
5.0,False,"03 22, 2014",A2G2CBEWM76RDG,B00HGLLRV2,jabykoay,"If you've unfamiliar with inFamous, the concept is the coolest thing you could ask for in a game.  Every inFamous game is a sandbox with endless freedom, like GTA, but you've got super powers.  While other super hero games are limited to established abilities, whatever was introduced in their respective comics, inFamous gives you Cole MacGrath and now Delsin Rowe, characters with completely fresh powers that grow until the game's completion.

inFamous 2, in my opinion was hands down, the best game for the PS3 and my personal favorite game of all time.  Suckerpunch provided the aforementioned concept, incredible voice acting, beautiful graphics, great story & characters, finely crafted cut scenes & well written dialogue and fun, fun, fun gameplay.  It's a 10.  So inFamous Second Son was anticipated with high standards to be met or surpassed.

Upon first hearing Delsin talk, I said to myself, ""Oh screw this guy.""  I immediately missed Cole  But as the story progressed, he quickly grew on me.  There are definitely aspects to Delsin that make for a far more thrilling character to play.  As soon as you get your first power, taking into consideration this is a vast open world sandbox, graphics are absolutely stunning, comparable to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes.  The fire effects, smoke, streets, lights and reflections, all just pop.  The variety of people occupying Seattle, however, felt lazy.  I saw the same faces over and over again, but I am guessing this was deliberately kept minimal to concentrating efforts where the pay off was obvious.  It just becomes noticeable when some of your missions involve looking for people.

I'm big on great music in video games and the score in ISS felt at times like it was trying to be cool.  But generally it worked.  Just occasionally distracting.  Nothing beats inFamous 1's soundtrack in this franchise.

When present, story, dialogue and cut scenes are just as solid as inFamous 2.  But these character moments are bare bones, mostly riding the book ends of the game, leaving you longing for much more in between.  The game wants you to care more for these characters than is warranted because they are simply not very involved in the journey.  To this issue, there is no real counterpart to keep you company and enjoy your growth with you like Zeke did for Cole in inFamous.  One very important element lacking in this installment which was present in previous was a sense of urgency, a constant driving force.  Particularly with inFamous 2, the stakes kept getting higher and throughout the entire game there was a looming danger.  inFamous Second Son however doesn't keep you aware of why you're playing.  What sends you on this mission to Seattle doesn't really come up again until the game is over.  The game sought to maintain the serious tone of inFamous, but Delsin doesn't really experience any down points or set-backs like Cole did.

Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, inFamous Second Son has some really great surprises.  The previous installments had far more variety in terms of optional side missions and as a completionist, I found myself annoyed at the unforgivably identical side missions that filled each district.  The game plagiarized itself about 20 times.  There is a spray paint side mission in every district, sometimes more than one.  I have no idea why this is part of the game and made to feel important.  It may as well have been a cut scene you are awarded for watching, as that's how much you participate in the spray paint side missions.  They're not even missions.  They're just a hassle you have to do if you want to do everything.  And just when this was about to take it's toll on me, ISS hit me with something strong, near the mid-way point that rejuvenated my energy.  Then it does this again at the 75% mark and even up to the end.  That being said, the second half of the game is far more interesting than the first half.

Regardless of your powers, upgrades and the area you are playing, what you you encounter most are the DUP: Depart of Unified Protection.  They all work for the big bad boss you meet at the beginning and know you are going to have to fight.  But what might have helped is if Sucker Punch gave this boss at least one or two mini bosses you had to face.  Instead, you deal with the same henchmen again and again.  And while they get progressively stronger, thusly more difficult and interesting to battle, it can't help but feel a bit redundant.  No other super bosses is pretty disappointing, knowing they did this better in previous installments.

The most frustrating thing I learned only after the fact is that I probably shouldn't have been such a completionist until I beat the game, as you are given opportunities between story missions and even post-ending to finish up anything incomplete.  My advice if you haven't played it yet is to follow the story forward whenever the game will allow you in order for you, the player, to appreciate what you are given to play with.

Just to be clear, the positive aspects of the game, which are huge and very fun, I can't really discuss, so as not to give away surprises.

Summary:
Despite the very annoying shortcomings (mainly because I had very high expectations),  ISS feels like a passable continuation.  I have no regrets about my purchase and still love it.  Sucker Punch produced the most beautiful game for the PS4.  It's very fun when you're not doing the uncreative side missions.  With each story mission, the game continues to elevate right up to the end, as it's predecessors do.  While the journey is not as well constructed as inFamous 2, Second Son is certainly the biggest inFamous game with the most options and choices for your main character.  I highly recommend it and still feel that it made the PS4 a worthwhile purchase.  I look forward to the next inFamous installment and will be pre-ordering that as well in whatever the collector's edition is available.  Currently, inFamous 2 still holds the champion title.",Made PS4 Worth It - SPOILER-FREE REVIEW,1395446400,74,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

When I read about the port to the PS2 I was pretty damn skeptical. For one thing, ports are almost always JUST what's on the game. With this, it was different. Not only are the graphics cleaned up a notch, but they added a new level, and even allow Mr. Slam's special to function the same way in single-player as multiplayer. In the PSP version, he doesn't use his bucket slam. In this version's multiplayer, he does.

What's more, they also added the original FMV endings from Twisted Metal 1 on the PS1 that were cut in lieu of a text-box ending. Even more, they have what was done of Twisted Metal Black 2 as an added feature, complete with co-op and competitive play. If that still isn't enough they added a little documentary about the series and include a cut on-foot mode with little bits of trivia.

TL; DR Version:

Rather than simply port the game as-is, they fleshed out bugs and other problems. Plus, they added in all sorts of bonus content from previous games as well as beta material. A must-buy for any fan of Twisted Metal.","Surprisingly well-ported, and with many bonus features.",1335830400,4,,

5.0,False,"04 5, 2001",AKOQ2U5KUVSN2,B00004UDVL,Brian Duffy,"OVERALL/STORY:
I know that there are so many great new concepts for storylines in RPG's. But theres usually some time when you want to turn back the clock and play a good ol' fashioned savetheworlder. But there's not that many new ones with great graphics/characters/environments/battle system(final fantasy VII aside) Then comes Grandia 2. Sure, you're saving the world but theres more to the story. The game deals alot with Religion. granas(god) versus valmar(satan). Theres a big legend aspect to it. But I'll admit, it can get repetitive. You go to a village, somethings wrong, you help, move on. But you can't get too mad at this game because it has so many great qualities.
GRAPHICS:
One of the First RPG's to feature full rotatable 3D backgrounds. they look great. Its alot of fun to just run around and rotate the map to see everything. The characters are rendered well. Not too much detail on the faces but their movements are very fluid and their clothing looks really nice. The spells look really cool. Some of them even weave in anime sequences. I find this strange because the FMVs are in CG. I think there shouldve been anime FMVs. That way, there could be more of them. One more cool thing is your characters' anime face shows up on the dialog boxes so you can see their emotions.
GAMEPLAY:
The battle system is great! instead of your characters lining up and facing the enemy, theres a large battle field that everyone moves around in. The interesting thing is, its still turn based. Your characters will move around on their own or you can tell them to move to specific spots. One of the most interesting battle aspects is you see your enemies on the non-battle(quest or whatever you call it) screen. This is a reminicent of Chrono Trigger. You can avoid them or sneak up. Even so battles are frequent so theres a cool AI system. You can set parameters for each character to fight by.

Red and Blue were still huge,and the anime was craze on its own. Pokemon Yellow is alot of fun. If you have Red or Blue,then their isn't much of a point,but,it's still a classic. Yellow is more like the anime,making it more advance,but still enjoyable.

Pokemon Yellow came out and fans were hyped. Pikachu,the franchises mascot is having its own game? No way!!!! Of course!!!! Red and Blue was so popular back in 1998,that Yellow version was made. Pokemon Yellow was huge. Anime fans loved it because traveling around with a pikachu makes it feel like your the the main character in the anime:ASH KETCHUM!!!! However,some fans were disappointed that Yellow had on new pokemon. Yellow version features Pikachu,Bublasaur,Charmader,Squrtial,and Eveve.

Yellow was like Red and Blue,but better. You get a level 5 Pikachu. Your rival gets a level 5 Eveve. The Pikach walks around. You can talk it,too. Pikachu even has its own noise!!!! Pika!!!! Pikachu likes you more,the more you walk with it. The graphics were improved a little bit. The way the pokemon looks is much better then Red and Blue. There is also a new move known as Kenisis. The three starters are also available. I mean,ALL OF THEM!!!! Minor glitches were also improved. Pikachu can also learn surf by using Pokemon Stadium. Pikachu also will not evolve into Rachiu,just like Ashes Pikachu. You can also play a Pikachu game by teaching it surf. The game is about a little Pikachu surfing on the waves. Pikachu was everyone's favorite Pokemon,and now,you can own one without catching it.

Pokemon Yellow also had its own glitches too. The Missingno Glitch is not possible to catch. The famous Mew Glitch,Glitch city,and others are still able to get. There is glitch that lets you teach Pikachu surf without using Stadium. I forget how to do it. Go to YouTube and watch a video about by a person named Missingnoxpert. He did a video on it. Search Lets Gltich Pokemon Yellow and it should show up. Anyways,another glitch called super glitch is in Yellow. 7 Words:This Glitch can corrupt your save file. Be very careful doing it. The glitch pokemon known as Q(yes,Q). Can do this glitch. It can cause a huge amount of health,a burn which kills the opponent with one shot,no music,and TM trainer. Never save after doing this. Still,a awesome glitch. Another glitch lets you have a level 100 ninoking. By doing this,have a escape rope with you. Go to Veridain forest. Go right in front of a trainer while quickly pressing start. Use the escape rope. Go back to Veridain forest. Just like the Mew glitch,you cannot talk to anyone nor use the start button. You must battle a level 4 Caterpie. After beating it,go back to Pewter City. Let the boy take you to the gym. Then,go back to the forest again. A battle should happen. A level 100 nidoking should appear. Now you have a level 100 pokemon before getting the first badge. I think that's how you do it. Go on YouTube to Missingnoxpert again. He has a video on it.

If you have Red or Blue,then there is no need for this game. If you don't have Red or Blue,then get Yellow. For a huge PokeManic,then Yellow is good. Pokemon yellow is enjoyable,and is a classic. It is fun,highly recommended.",PokeMania at its peak!!!!,1414886400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I would highly recommend considering this game to any casual player, sports fan, or anyone who looked at this and thought ""that looks pretty fun.""  Probably the first thing that you will run into is the greatly implemented adventure/story mode. This mode is fun and is filled with challenges and some strategy/puzzle elements. Some little challenges that you will encounter are timing your batting or throwing curve balls and stuff like that to recruit various team members to your roster. You must venture your way through five unique and well designed stadiums based on the captains. They each include the captain in the name and their sidekick/equivalent. Once you beat every one of the 5 stadiums you must defeat Bowser Junior in his own stadium. After you defeat Bowser Jr. you obtain the ability to change the time from night to day. You do this by pressing A on the sun/moon. There you must fight the final boss ... none other than bowser. Once you defeat bowser, you can return to adventure mode and do two things. You can play a variety of fun minigames, or you can play against teams when you unlock all players in their stadium. The next thing is exhibition. You can spend hours on end playing matches and creating new teams and strategies. This game has replay value that is limitless. The only problem is how some times players keep going once they get to bases they were supposed to stop at, and then run back a split second after. This is rarely a problem though. This game is worth a lot, but just do not buy from here for $67 as of it was sold for $20. I would buy it for about $30 new if you can though. If you want at the moment you can get it for a little less than $20 used. I would recommend at least consider purchasing this somewhere for a decent price.

Seriously, this is the most fun I've had playing a basketball game my whole video game career. And take it from someone who always has loved NBA Live. This year, 2k6 is king.

Remembver Sega Sports? It all got started on the Dreamcast with NFL 2k and NBA 2K. Well, Sega Sports is certainly gone, but the developer (Visual Concepts) moved on and now we have 2K Games. And it's nice to see them back in action.

First things first though, if you have this on the regular XBOX, you may not want to get the 360 version, unless you want to see this in 1080 HD glory. But basically it's the same game as the XBOX one with better graphics. But as a standalone 360 title, it's a very high quality game of hoops and I think it's one of the best games on the system. The gameplay is right on and very in-depth for hardcore fans of the game. The graphics are crisp and very refined and the work put into the player models are well noticed. NBA Live probably has better looking player models, but when you put both games in motion, there is no contest. 2k6 looks like a TNT game live on your TV. I can't believe how real this game looks. The gameplay is very tight and realistic. Realistic stats, good TV style pressentation and the goods to make you very happy throughout your stay with the game. The game is jammed packed with tons of modes. Exhibtion, street ball, 2 on 2, 3 on 3, 4 on 4, and of course the regular NBA 5 on 5.

The best part, online. Online is fantastic. I played about 15 games so far and I didn't notice any lag. I would say it's like your playing your buddy on couch 90% of the time, that's how good and smooth it is online. No offense to NBA Live, but why can't Live play this smooth online 24/7? It just doesn't happen.

NBA 2k6 is the caviar sports game on the 360. Thanks to E.A. truly rushing their titles out, this one really shows how empty E.A.'s games are this year for the 360 launch. I'm sure E.A. will make a comeback for late 06, but until then, NBA 2k6 is the best hoops game to buy for the system. Keep your eyes out for 2k's college hoops too. If this game is any indication on how college hoops will turn out, I'm sure that will be a must buy too. Thank goodness E.A. didn't get the NBA License this year, it would have been a catastrophe not being able to enjoy a game like this. Buy this game now.","The old Sega Sports is back, well, kind of!!!",1141603200,9,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Yes, the game does ask you to put some time into it to learn its tricks of the trade, but by no means is it a messy endeavor.  For those new on the block, there's an extensive yet simple mode that streamlines every game mechanic it has to offer you at a good, explainable pace.  For older Tekken vets who haven't played a Tekken title in awhile, it's a nice refresher course. For all others you can simply go straight into any of the other modes that suit your playing needs.

The coolest feature by far is the character customizations.  While it does sport an in-game currency system that's used to purchase customized item for each of the 50-odd fighters, with enough playtime via online or arcade and you'll have enough to make your favorite fighter indistinguishable from all others.  Another customizable feature is the nifty ability to choose the tracks you want played for each of its stages - whether other in-game tracks, DLC, or personal music stowed on your system.

Only downside you may find with this game is the learning curve - there's alot to remember, and the idea of memorizing anything may throw gamers of any level off easily.

No Bluetooth so you can't turn on the console with the PS button, not a problem! It's AA battery operated (not rechargeable)! So why the hell would it cost more than the official deal?! This is supposed to be an economical alternative to having to pay $55 for Sony's Six-axis controller. What fools are trying to get more than that for this?! What fools are trying to pay more than that?!

That being said, I love Logitech ever since is got the wireless controllers for PS2 back in the day. Their controllers take abuse and shine with precision still!  It takes several rage-smashing occurrences before their performance is diminished or they cease to be intact. Even still, I recommend handling them with reverence. The feel of it sits in your hand better, a matter of opinion, but it's mine! It just cradles right in there! With the way it's constructed, the top buttons and D-pad won't wear down. The front/bumper buttons have a better feel than Sony's IMHO. This device is always responsive! Or at least this company's other products are.

I never run into a game where I'd rather utilize six-axis input. I'm just not that type of gamer. So it doesn't matter to me that it isn't such a controller, and it doesn't matter one iota that I can't turn on the PS3 with the PS-button, it's just a bell/whistle that I can live without for an ECONOMICAL controller.

Here's a CAVIAT EMPTOR.  The triangle button got sticky so then I needed to clean it so it would reposition immediately. I took it apart carefully and did such. I put it back together just as i found it and then the left bumper was a little too recessed, kept dragging on the shell it seemed, causing a hair trigger response or even activating itself. I examined the cause, but it remained so. Then while playing CoD MW3, the sprint (R3) increasingly lost effectiveness. I wasn't using this controller long (couple months), i usually resorted to the official SONY controller, but Logitech's felt better to hold. Anyways, cause I had a few problems with the controller... well, thats what brought me here to find they are charging almost 10x what i paid for it. Not getting a used one cause mine was only slightly used and giving me problems.  So the warning is, i don't know if taking it appart was the cause of all the malfunctions -never affected the PS2 controllers- or because it was on it's way to fail me when it came out of the package.",Huh!?,1389830400,,,

It's exactly like the old X-men legends, which were both also awesome games with lots of characters. This is a very well balanced game too! In X-men legends cyclops was so powerful you could fully upgrade him and the just walk into a room of enemies and one or two quick blasts and they'd all be dead! In this game you can't do that, not that it's hard, there's three levels of play, easy, normal, and hard so any age can play and enjoy it. The key to success in this game isn't one powerful character it's a well balanced team. There are levels where you can't get passed certain points without specific powers like flight for example. So it's important to have 1 member who can fly at all times, one member who can shoot projectile powers, one who can self heal quickly like wolverine or Deadpool, and a 4th who can put enemies on the mini map (daredevil). One of them must be strong enough for the strength parts too (ironman, Luke cage, thing, colossus) or you can't get past. There's parts where you'll need to have the human touch to start fires too.

It's a very good game with o lyrics two slight negatives. I think the graffics are a little cartoonie but I understand this is more of a kids game than anything. The other negative is the camera angle is a little high so you can't much see in front of the characters so you frequently walk right into bad guys who strike you before you even know they're there.

Trusting in the reviews of this mouse, I bought it. And man alive has it lived up to it's reviews! It is an excellent mouse(a little on the large side, but comfortable even with my small hands). It has just the right weight to it and the buttons(all of them), as well as the scroll wheel, have great tactile feedback.
Even though I'm very new to this mouse(I got it only about 11 hours ago as of this review), I'm already quite comfortable with it. Setting it up was easy; just make sure you read the owners manual before you start playing around too much with it or you'll give yourself a brainache.
My favorite feature of this mouse(one I wasn't sure I'd even use when I bought it) is it's ability to have up to five separate modes(more like profiles really) that can be swapped between using a button built into the mouse. The LED build into the mouse changes hue depending on which mode you're in. This is great for when you want to switch between games quickly without having to reconfigure your mouse.

5.0,False,"11 30, 2008",A1NFPIQC6SMGQ3,B0017HM0JY,Emie,"This is the version no one ever seems to talk about...the lowly PS2 port of Sonic Unleashed.

And, having never played the other versions, I must say I'm pretty impressed.  Perhaps my lack of experience with the PS3 and Xbox versions allows me a truly unbiased perspective...allowing me to evaluate the PS2 on it's own merit.  And, it has a lot of merit.

The daytime speed levels are really fun.  Never before has a sonic game truly captured the feeling of BEING Sonic the hedgehog.  Phases melt seamlessly into each other as first person perspective shifts to side view to front view and back.  These levels have mastered the concept of ""flow"" that the original Genesis Sonic games made famous.

What many people don't seem to realize is that the controversial night levels (featuring Sonic the Werehog) are just as reminiscent of the old Genesis games as the daytime levels.  NONE of the original 16-bit Sonic games was 100% speed.  In fact, a large fraction of  the average Sonic zone was PLATFORMING.  And, that is precisely what the werehog levels offer.  Platforming, puzzles, and some Streets of Rage style beat 'em up action.  If games like God of War and Heavenly Sword can receive widespread acclaim, I don't see why the werehog levels should offend anyone...because they're the same thing.

Plus, the werehog levels provide balance for the frenetic pace of the speed levels.  Just as the original 16-bit Sonic games were balanced between speed and platforming, Sonic Unleashed is balanced between daytime levels and night levels.  This is nothing new people.  I don't see why the official game reviews are so bothered by a concept introduced by Sonic the Hedghog 1: ""balance"".

The levels (both day time and night time) are well designed and engaging.  Victory is very satisfying.  Werehog levels, while slower than the speed levels, are not really THAT slow (he can run by double tapping a direction).  The semi-frequent fights may become repetitive to some, but honestly, the Final Fight fan in me enjoyed them.

And, besides, if you absolutely HATE the werehog levels, you only have to play them once.  After encountering a stage, you are free to choose it again from the menu.  So, feel free to replay those unlocked daytime stages exclusively.  Even alone they're worth the price of admission.

Bottom line:  The game is fun.  Colorful and energetic, while paced between high speed excitement and methodical exploration.

An impressive PS2 game.  And, hopefully (if enough people give the game a try) this will be the first step towards Sonic's long overdue rebirth.",This game is fun and well made.,1228003200,15,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

In both games, you don't just have search-and-find, but you also have puzzles. I'll describe one of my favorites:

You start out with a bowl with different compartments. When you look at all the compartments, it makes a monochrome image of a face. A few of the compartments have some primary colored water in it and a plug that opens it up to other compartments.

Your task is to open the right plugs in the right order so that the water spills out and fills the bowl to make the correct colors of the face. Some parts have to have primary colors, some parts secondary colors.

Some of the puzzles can leave you stumped for a while. And if you're not  the type of person to spend 10 minutes on a hard one, then you can always hit the skip button.

5.0,False,"10 21, 2008",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000ZK696O,Lisa Shea,"The successor to the Ninja Gaiden game for the Xbox, Ninja Gaiden 2 is one of those rare sequels that seems to improve on everything done by the first game while adding worthwhile new features, enemies, and levels.

The basic gameplay is the same as the first Ninja Gaiden game, featuring fast-and-frantic swordplay and various ninja abilities to supplement it. You play as Ryu Hayabusa, last ninja of the Dragon Clan lineage, and your mission is to seal the ancient Arch-Fiends away before they destroy the world. The action is almost non-stop in NG2; Ryu has a wide array of acrobatic actions at his disposal to aid in his swordplay. There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small.

The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play ""one on one"" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of ""abilities"", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay.

As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is ""running forward"", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run).

The graphics in the game are really good looking, though ""realistic"" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being ""artistic"", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it.

The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though.

As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay.

I must say that this game is even more enjoyable than the first of the series, and the 1st Donkey Kong Country is already a classic. Dixie Kong has some special abilities she has to offer here. When she twirls her hair, she can defeat the baddies and also glide in the air. A new feature for the series!

Another new feature is the Kong Throwing method, in which you can team up both Diddy and Dixie and use it to grab out-of-reach items and platforms (you must have both Kongs in order to use it, though).

Your animals buddies also increase, with the help of a springy snake and a web-making spider. Squawks, Rambi, and Enguarde also come back, better than ever!

The music and the graphics are excellent. Again, Rareware's production make the 16-bit look improved, and the soundtrack is just as great as the first.

O&#039;Niell,"I love the original Red Faction, I played on the PC and PS2 (pssst it's better on the PC) anyway, RF2 was alright but not as fantastic as the first one, RF has a pretty good story and the humor was great, but both where FPS games, so I was really worried they where going to hack up RFG as it is now a TPS.

Well I'm about 50% done the single player campaign, and have logged many hours of online, I can not get enough Red Faction Guerilla.

Single Player:
This is great, we have tons of fun here. The maps are really nice, very easy to navigate, and very large. There is a great selection of missions ranging from destroying a building or structure as fast as humanly possible to extracting hostages' who are being probably tortured from your terrorist actions as new member of the Red Faction, all with out them dying.
Driving around is actually really fun, I don't normally like driving in a game, but this was nice, all your vehicle options are distinctively different from each other, if you drive a big dump truck, it's slow and is terrible at cornering but you have a massive destructive power, being able to drive it through a building with ease. But if you are looking for fast and small with great handling, there is that to, but at the same time you give up that fantastic crushing capability.

As far as weapons go you can upgrade everything at one of your safe houses after you collect ""salvage"" I actually liked doing this, it's like my goal to get as much salvage as I can possible get, the more the better. There is really a weapon for every situation your in, and when you run out of ammo, get your hammer out and start bashing everything in sight, you can take out buildings people walls trucks and just about anything that looks like it could brake, all with a little mining hammer. As like most games the more you play the more weapons you unlock and then you can buy them.
There are ammo crates all over so if you find that there are to many EDF (Earth Defense Force, they are the enemy) around and not enough bullets or rockets then just load up and at the same time you can change you weapons selection as long as you have them unlocked.
And the whole moral thing they have is neat, the higher the moral of the Red Faction the more ammo will be in the crate for you to reload with, they also help you fight when they are happy. If you die or a member of the RF dies, you get less ammo and they will also freak out and run away from a fight when the moral meter is low.

Over all the single player is great so far, anyone who does not like it has not played for long enough, it's easy at first but once you get in to it, it's a quick jump to becoming more difficult and hopefully you have collected enough salvage to fight the good fight and free mars from the tyranny of the US government......Umm I mean the EDF, there couldn't be a major political parallel in RFG could there?

Multiplayer:
I won't spend to long on this but wow this just as fun as single player, maybe even more fun. They replace the run with a whole bunch of different backpacks, like a jet pack, my fav is the Rhino pack where you are able to smash through enemies and walls or both.
The game types are the same as you would find in most multiplayer games, nothing new here, just that an enemy can come from anywhere, so essentially no cover, they will just hammer there way to you, and beat you down, as you cower in fear because you're out of ammo with no back pack and wish you picked up the Thrust pack to shoot out the top of the building only to die mid flight from some kid with a rocket launcher.

RFG multiplayer = hours and hours of destructive endless fun.

As for graphics, no it's not like there KZ2 or anything like that, but I just think it leaves miles of room for improvement in hopefully RF4 for whatever they call it. And it seems to be smooth, no jerking around or getting stuck on a corner, just great game play.
My only real complaint is that there is no Co-op campaign, because come on that would be stellar in so many ways, maybe next time.

And I do think if you play online this is totally worth full price.",Whatever the opposite of disappointed is...,1244419200,15,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The setup is virtually the same as in Cooking Mama. You garden things and then you get a grade for it. There are a couple changes that are worth noting however:
One bonus is that the game is in bird's eye view; you get to roam the garden and select what you want to grow. More options become available as you progress and your garden expands into new areas. You also get more plants to grow as you go along.
Another nice thing is that you can change Mama's outfits and even decorate your garden with the bonus prizes you earn. This is fun when you want to take a break from gardening.

The major difference with Gardening Mama from Cooking Mama is that instead of just cooking a dish and being done you have to allow your plants to grow. So when you garden something you are not done for a while. There are many steps to garden until you get a finished product. Sometimes you can even make food from a plant. It can get kind of annoying waiting for plants to grow because you have to watch them. If you forget about one Mama will come on the screen and alert you, which gets tedious. But other than that waiting for plants isn't too bad.

I would recommend this game for any Cooking Mama fan or anyone wanting to try out the series. It is very fun alone or in single-card download mode. The developers have been consistent with the look and gameplay of the series, which keeps it familiar yet still refreshing. A must for all Mama fans!",She's baaack...,1243987200,22,,

Super Mario Bros. was a smash hit, and its American sequel was a completely different type of game. Konami's Castlevania was followed up by Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, a game that strayed entirely from its origins. And then there was Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the follow-up to the smash hit The Legend of Zelda. Released in 1988, Zelda II proved to be an entirely different experience from the first and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead of a game that relied on epic, blind exploration and top-down dungeon-crawling action, Zelda II introduced a completely new idea for the series, and one that hasn't been revisited since. Link mainly navigated around an RPG-like world map, with action occurring sporadically in side-scrolling sequences. These sequences were parlayed into the game's labyrinthine dungeons as well. Zelda II's entire system suggested it was trying to be more of an RPG, and in many ways, it was a huge success. Debate ensues to this day surrounding Zelda II's place in The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole, but most everyone agrees that Zelda II is a stellar standalone title.",Zelda 2 The Adventure of Link,1369094400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Think about it... despite the fact you'll be repurchasing Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, you're still getting 3 new gaming bits of content which if you null the price of the latter two, that's basically about 15 to 16 dollars a piece of each game... but if you consider all 5 of them at once, that's basically paying 4-5 bucks depending on where you're buying, and cheaper the longer it stays out and remains a constant hit on the market!

It really is a wonderful bundle of games and will keep your entertained for a good amount of time. I haven't played Half-Life in almost 10 years now and when Half-Life 2 came out in 2004, I was elated but delayed of enjoying it because of such a ridiculously mediocre computer at hand... and the constant fear that my hardware would be outdated the minute I got it. With the fear of obsoletion aside, I've finally managed and figured the best system of computer to buy, videocard that'll keep me happy and I was on my way from joy 3 years delayed.

Best of all, I get the main game, Episode 1 and 2 as well as the expanding, seemingly short-story game that comes along with it, Portal.

As a first time experience with Half-Life 2... it's one of those rare games that gives me hope back into the PC game scene with its invocative story, deep, engaging and suspenseful; I hadn't felt like this while playing a PC game since the original Half-Life... and I was amazed, shocked even, that Half-Life 2 wasn't just another game that came out in the span of the new century with pretty graphics and the cliche knack to involve ""physics"" into a game to make it seem more realistic and appealing... but truthfully, it has pushed the envelope and breaks my mentality and reason of what just a computer gaming can be, not just a game, but an experience! It's like watching a movie you get to control and if you allow yourself to become immersed into it, let it happen, because this game is really something you shouldn't let pass you by.

Portal on the other hand, has anyone seen the movie Cube? I'll bet everyone has at one point whether they know the movie or not... but Portal feels EXACTLY like how that movie does, except you're alone, can makeshift portals, yet the element of open-ended fear and suspense through survival is always about you. This honestly was the first time I'd been mentally engaged with a game having to strategize, time and figure out your actions that lead to successl which in this case for Portal, failure is not an option, just a humiliation of your intellect; or that was my take on it anyway. Wanna real challenge? Try playing Portal through in one sitting... I'll guarantee you won't be able to without your head spinning from volatile camera and perspective shifts and the fact you'll have to be critically thinking how you're going to solve the puzzles and challenges in this game. This game itself could have been a stand alone product by Valve, but considering it was included with this compilation, it was an exceptional addition and one hell of a game.

Lastly, there is the holy grail to this cove of treasures, and it's the Source-powered game Team Fortress 2. In this original founder and granddaddy of all character-set, team-based gameplay, it has revamped not to be victim of its own hype where all other games such as its own have come. There are no overbearing weapons, no substandard of alternative to result yourself to, there's only good wholesome fun with all the classes you can play as in this game all bearing some major mettle and worth of their own. The gameplay is awesome, it's actually an FPS that's fun to play and the only thing that ruins it, on a personal note, is the fact that your teammates just pretty much suck so if you ever join up in a game full of clanners, leave that server immediately as they more than likely have figured the game and its maps out, working their strategies out on their futile opponents and taking advantage of their disadvantage of those who are still trying to figure this game out... just stay away and join them much later when everyone gains a good amount of experience under their belt for this game-- it's just a turkeyshoot for the clanners really.

Personal comments aside of the gaming experience and for the whole package of this compilation-- it really is one of the best deals, if not THE best deal in videogame history.

It continues a legacy to one of the most provocative gaming franchises ever conceived...

Has a story deeper than any Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid plotline could have (Sorry Snake... but a man who isn't succumbed to nanotechnology-biologics-enhancement and turning 70 years old faster than he grows own hair just doesn't seem to cut it... plus what's the deal with what the Gears in that new Metal Gear Solid sounding like cows and having long dancer legs? I just don't get it...).

Finally, an overall experience past being just a game.

FINAL THOUGHTS

You can be all about the multiplayer for everyone who considers themselves ""gamers"" and I'll be treading on minefield littered soil here when I say this, but as much as their are Halo fans, get over that hype... the story was extended just so they could create ""a trilogy"" and simply so for Microsoft to move on by saying they've accomplished a feat of FPS gaming for everyone to enjoy... innovations, some, because Halo was actually a good hit on the gaming scene but as far as storytelling, scope and feel, there are certainly other games that have came out before, even after it, and continue a legacy much deeper and rich of its creation, for those who honor and respect it beyond it's appeal as just being stated as, ""just a game"".","As is says on the back of the box,",1193616000,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

But heres the deal, rationally I can't judge a game by comparing it to a game from 10 years ago, it just doesn't make sense.

So I judge games based on whether they are fun, whether its attractive enough compared to other games of its time period, and whether the number of hours of enjoyment will compare favorably to other recent games and/or other activities.

1) The game is fantastic, I'm really enjoying the game, and I'm hoping more RTS's make a comeback, I was missing the genre.
2) Its a beautiful game, really, it sends a new standard. And no, graphics don't replace fun gameplay, but if there are 2 games of equal fun, and one is more beautiful, I'll always choose the more beautiful game.  Yes people, this game has beauty, smarts, AND personality. ;)
3)The number of hours....I'm playing the terran campaign on hard, I think there are 29-30 missions.  The first few missions were quick, but I'm already starting to encounter the longer missions where I have to struggle to learn the trick, master the mission.  This is without even adding multiplayer, which to me for any game is just gravy.  I expect the game to give me 20-30 hours of enjoyment from the single player alone, and my friends are all training against the AI for multiplayer, so I expect at least a few dozen hours of multiplayer.

For 60 bucks, I'll accept 20-30 hours of fun gameplay, so starcraft 2 is, by that logic, worth it.

I think this game is fantastic.  I knew exactly what the game was going to give me beforehand, so I don't have any feeling of bait and switch, and I'm not a whiner, so I'm not going to complain about what it doesn't have when what it ""does"" have is more than worth the money.

Cons: The last two campaign levels are weak. The impact of Pointstreaks and strike packages will depend entirely on your own skill level.

A combination of J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club,"" and any kid's movie about school between 1985 and 1996, ""Bully"" is an interactive adventure that puts you in the role of the Holdenesque Jimmy Hopkins, who is trying to make it through being dumped by his mother and stepfather at Bullworth Academy-- the worst school in America. There he deals with bullies, nerds, preps, jocks and greasers and slowly, over the course of the game, makes friends with each clique through mischievous schoolyard pranks and almost RPG-oriented missions.

The game was fairly controversial upon release, though those criticizing it obviously didn't play it. The objective of the game is not to be a bully, but to stop the bullying at Bullworth Academy and make it a better place. The game is very fun, and is my second favorite game of all time, next to ""Harvest Moon 64"" (Ranch Story 2 in Japan). I anxiously look forward to a sequel to ""Bully,"" which I hope will continue the adventures of Jimmy maybe at a college! Then they could make a video-game along the lines of ""Animal House."" Either way, ""Bully"" is a fun, light-hearted and magical video-game.

I highly recommend this game!",My second favorite game of all time!,1315353600,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

...because it'll never measure up to Forza.

Racing is a relatively stagnant style of gaming.  Pick a car, pick a track, race.  Hope to place first.  Rinse, wash and repeat.  Only the die-hard automotive / racing enthusiast is going to enjoy a racing game.  But Forza 3 gives the enthusiast SO much more to enjoy - it's simply unbelievable.  At any given time, you could:

Run a race
Buy a car - from over 300 available models
Paint a car, and/or cover it with 4,000 layers of graphics
Share your car designs on your own storefront for people to browse, rate, and buy.
Create images using graphic layers for your storefront - like license plates, manufacturer logos, etc.
Browse the auction house for some good deals, or to sell one of your own.
Search the storefront for photos, replays, graphic designs for specific cars, or separate images to place on any car
Tune your favorite car for optimum performance - adjusting everything from gear ratios to tire pressures
Take photos of your cars and designs at any of Forza 3's 35+ tracks

This is just a taste of the variety that Forza 3 gives you.  More times than I can remember, I set out to create a simple paint job, and 2 hours later have created a masterpiece that I just HAVE to photograph and share online.  Or a simple test-and-tune of my favorite car has turned into an extensive experiment with Forza's newest ability to add all-wheel-drive to various cars in the lineup.  Also new with this version is the ""conversion"" which, including the aforementioned all-wheel-drive, allows you to swap engines (though only within the same manufacturers lineup) or choose between turbocharged or supercharged add-ons.  In short, if you can dream it, chances are good Forza 3 will let you create it.

The online racing isn't as easy to access - it's a major beef with gamers.  Personally, I'm an older gamer myself, so I started my own discussion on the [...] website and now have over 30 people to race with!  Someone is usually always online, and joining into a race or inviting friends to yours is just as easy as always.

There's a few issues: some paint glitches with various cars, the AI controls your engine speed until a half-second before the race starts, and the ""livery editor"" can get a little confused when handling large numbers of graphic layers.  But these issues hardly hurt the game.  If anything - it shows how good this game is - that's all we can find to complain about!

If you enjoy racing - even just a little - you'd probably be pleased with Forza 3.  It connects you to the sport, to your cars, and to each race.  It is easily the best racing game to exist - at least until Forza 4!",The.  Ultimate.,1259366400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5.0,False,"04 28, 2010",A2YBK1DO7ORNRK,B000XJNTNS,Joshua A. Parker,"First off, let me just say I am a huge Mario Kart fan and Nintendo is very good at what they do. I've played every Mario Kart game there is to play at this point in time. Mario Kart wii is a good game and one of my favorites and should definitely be on any Nintendo gamesters list of collectibles. The game has a bunch of brand new courses never before seen in the series, and also refreshes some of the nostalgia by adding some old mario kart tracks from all the mario kart games made so far. they are titled as the Nitro cups, mushroom, flower, star, and special and also has the retro cups shell, bannana, leaf, and the lightning cup. one of the coolest things I've found so far is the more options you get under the rules menu, such as the ability to change the items to none, strategic, bannanas, boosts, single shells, etc. Those two things the rules mode and the retro nitro tracks were added in mario kart ds with the exception of the item rule. However, You don't get to have the rules option in grand prix, so you'll get cheap shotted alot. In all honesty, though not much wass added that makes it any more awesome that it is. it's just another mario kart game. I'ts an awesome game though. One of my biggest gripes has to do with the director of the mario kart franchise. The saying that say's mario kart is a fun game and we always want to implement ways of how the player can have fun interacting with another player or players. the connection of people to people. Well theres something wrong here and it definitely doesn't fit the discription at all. The grand prix mode is a single player experience, meaning this. You have to sit down all by yourself in order to get all the Karts and unlockable all the while getting cheap shotted and blowed to bits by all the cheap computers. It's fun in multiplayer but in the Grand prix, its just flat out annoying. Also wheres that person-to-Person play thats happened in most of the mario karts. Mario kart ds didn't have the option either. Mario Kart Double Dash was awesome because you could have 4 people help you earn things, not only that it wasn't the same old slap of butter on the same old slab of bread that I have every morning. Every Mario Kart is the same thing now nothing intricately new or amazing. Another thing that bugs the crud out of me is the 4 added racers. Instead of 8 racers like its been in every other Mario Kart game, It's 12 now which raises the cheapness to a whole new level. This Mostly pertains to the single player Grand Prix mode, as such in vs mode you turn the items to None or strategic. Also get this 3 new cheap items have been added. The cheapest and worst item yet, the thunder cloud. Basically you get a thunder cloud and it shocks you and your small, however you can pass it off to other karts. If you can't find another kart to rub it off, you are screwed. The pow block has also been added also pretty cheap as well. You have to be in the air to dodge, mini jumping works sometimes but I can never get it to work like once in a blue moon. The mega mushroom was also added pretty much a star. You grow big and faster and trample on all Karts in your path. Blue shells are back and cheaper than ever before. They really stepped up the cheapness in this game on these and its gotten really bad since mario kart ds. Why can't the blue shells be like the ones in mario kart 64 or in mario kart supercircuit. In Mario kart 64 or the gba mario kart it would knock out all the players in its path. here it only knocks out the first placer. Well heres my logic on this. Say your in 8th place and you get a blue shell, how the heck is it sposed to help you. It hits the first placer and oooo goody now the second placer is in first place. Or how about the fact that it can appear like 5 times in a race and well your about 5 seconds from the finish line, and you get mega screwed. It seriously begs an explanation. Speaking of 8th place Oh here comes pow block, Oh here comes golden mushroom, Oh here comes a star, Oh here comes a mega mushroom, oh here comes a lightning cloud, Oh man watch those red shells. Just man in the grand Prix if your in like those few places your goin to get a bajillion items thrown in your face. Another major complaint about this game details the above info it is a luck fest, which is dumb. The bikes also just were a crappy addition. Lets just talk about the cheapest most overrated bike here, the legendary moc bike. It is just overpowered as heck. It is the cheapest, usable form of transportation in a Mario kart game. No exaggerations here. Also I feel this mario kart just is't as easy to pick up and play as older mario kart games are. A brand new power sliding teqnique has been implemented, to prevent the snaking form of sliding in mario kart ds which is amazing. But it can be difficult to get used to. Most people I've played Mario kart with mostly Mario kart ds, You can literraly not powerslide the entire time and have fun as such most of the people that I play with don't know how to powerslide. It's hard to do that in Mario kart wii as turning is incredibly delayed and If I didn't powerslide, I'd lose. There are two different methods used in Mario Kart wii. Automatic mode which is mainly to get the cheapness out of the bikes to cut turns rediculously hard. I also consider it to be a good beginner option, because you can turn alot better, it's still sluggish but you ca turn. One of the problems I find here is you cant jump. Why is that? Some courses you have to jump on or you'll go incredibly slow. For example, shy guy beach has a bunch of puddles and if you don't jump them you'll go slower. Manual mode is more Kart driven and allows you to powerslide and jump and turn rediculously slow. It's a lot different than others. Basically you turn and instead of wacking the control stick from side to side, you hold it in the opposite direction. Good feature implemented to prevent snaking, I'll give it that much. Also, I feel that its much slower pace than previous Mario karts. I feel like im going 10 mph. Mario kart 64 is the fastest paced, I have to say. For those who have played Mario kart 64, You'll know what I mean. It's not bad to be slow paced but its just a minor inconvience. Same thing with smash bros. brawl. In smash bros. melee was really fast, but in smash bros braw its sluggish. It's not that Mario Kart wii is a bad game because it isn't. There are just a bunch of things that annoy the ...... out of me. Overall its a good game to play and I'll pop it in every once in awhile. Definitely add this one to your list of wii games.",awesome mario kart game with some ups and downs,1272412800,,,

This is good, because the main ""AC"" storyline is so convoluted and confusing at this point that a departure feels like a breath of fresh air. There's still weird story moments that are hard to piece together and follow, but ""Black Flag"" is very much about putting you in the shoes of a pirate named Edward, and seeing what kind of trouble he can get into. As Edward, you gain command of a ship fairly early on, allowing you to sail the open seas and engage in some very exciting naval battles. Some enemy ships are tough though, and require an equally tough upgraded ship to overcome. The gorgeous tropical open-world of ""Black Flag"" is gigantic, with tons of large and small islands to explore, each with an insane number of collectibles and side-content. It can be very satisfying to slowly conquer one piece of the map at a time, progressively upgrading your equipment and your ship to becoming the ultimate pirate. It's also a little too slow at times, with so much to do that the game can feel extremely repetitive toward the end. Having too much can also be considered a good thing, and I might also consider this my favorite game in the series.

This title in the series is excellent and any worries i might have had about playing this on a handheld have vanished.  This game is as beautiful graphically as it's 360 cousin and the sound/music is also top notch.  The controls, for me at least, are smooth and tight and very responsive to my movements.  It's great to see the DOA characters again alongside my favorites like Kasumi and Jann-Lee and i have not unlocked everything yet but from what i can see this title may have every DOA character included in this version.

I started with the chronlogical mode that serves as both a tutorial and looks to wrap up the previous DOA stories and i'm guessing will go into the new one dimensions but i have only played to doa 3 atm, it was really nostalgic seing all those old bosses, costumes and seeing those old storylines i haven't seen for 5-10 years and i have not even touched arcade or any other mode yet, and with so much content to unlock like characters, costumes and figurines i can see myself playing this game for a LONG time to come.

This is so far one of the best 3ds titles available and gave me a reason to turn on my 3ds again and to keep it on for the coming weeks if not months.

To cut to the chase, this game is about building cities in ancient Egypt. In my opinion, the fun in playing games is about doing things that you can't do in real life, and city-building in ancient Egypt is a good example of one of those things. You will start by building some humble cottages and maybe even a well for your people. You will have to provide food, water, entertainment, health care etc., and as you do so, your city will evolve. If you need more money, you can build a tax collectors office. You decide how much tax the people are going to pay. Low tax will make you poor but popular (at least for a while), and high tax will make you richer but less popular. But then again, money is needed to make the city better. As your city gets bigger and better, you might even consider building the ultimate construction in the game: The Pyramid(!) If you're not interested in history now, I almost guarantee you will be after playing this game. I can't think of a game that has given me more hours of fun than this. Oh wait, the other games in Sierra's City Building series actually have: ""Caesar"", ""Caesar II"", ""Caesar III"", ""Caesar IV"", ""Master of Olympus - Zeus"", ""Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom"" are all made with this same great city-building-recipe as Pharaoh.

Who cares about multi-monitor, get a nice 21 or 24 inch and you're set.  The dialog is pretty good, especially the part where the Koreans speak, you know, Korean (but you can set them to English if you want).

The story is a mix of a special ops kind of game and something Cthulu-inspired, I'll leave it at that.

The suit and its powers are kind of the key to the whole thing.  They are sci-fi extensions of what we see now, brief bursts of strength, healing, etc.  A little fantastic, yes, but this is a GAME, you know, something where you pick up health packs and what not.  Why anybody who picks up a GAME is surprised says something about their intelligence.

The kills are finally difficult.  I have always wondered why the hero can take a bunch of rounds, wear all kinds of armor, yet the baddies are cut down in droves.  Mr. Mike Powell is just a bad shot.  Pump a bunch of sub-sonic rounds into the torso of a Korean soldier wearing body armor, and yes, it's a tough kill.  On the other hand, sneak up behind one and put a couple pistol rounds in the back of their head, and that's it.  The kills aren't hard, they are realistic.

The AI is very good, but not perfect.  Once in a while they seem oblivious, other times they all scurry over to see what the noise is all about.  They use a semblance of squad tactics.  They try to flank you.  And, something very rare, they may even run away if you lay waste to enough of their fellows.

I have a quad-core Intel CPU, 7800 GT card, 2 gigs RAM.....and Windows Vista.  It runs like a dream at the highest settings.  Mr. Powell apparently failed to read that Crysis is designed for DirectX 10 and Windows Vista.  Ooops for him.  Trust me, with a good gamer system built in the last 6 months, you will see every leaf and branch moving and reacting, getting brushed aside by your gun barrel, getting shot or blown off, etc.

CoD 4 is nice, but it's just the same old rat maze every other CoD has had.  I get tired of having to move along one path and fight endlessly spawning bad guys until I move past a checkpoint.  THAT is hokey.  Crysis is more like the Rainbow Six games, where there are set numbers of enemies and it's up to you how you want to pick them off.  Personally, I just like driving a truck into their camps full bore and leap out guns blazing, but you can snipe them too.

I've never liked playing turned based RPG's, ( I like real time fighting better ) but DS is not your typical RPG, it's a combination of three different game-play genres: A platform adventure, A puzzle adventure, and a beat-um-up fighter. The first two game-play genres are in an isometric 3-D world. ( looking down at an angle ) The third ( the fighting section ) is rendered in a 3-D perspective, but is in 2-D. You definitely get your moneys worth with all the different types of game-play that's involved in this one of a kind game. You play as Garian the bounty hunter, he's tasked with escorting a monster called Bilan on a ship headed towards a prison island. He then escapes, ( the monster, pay attention! ) and you have four minutes to get to him before he kills the ships captain in his cabin. How long it takes you to capture him determines where you go in the game, and which ending you get to experience. There are five different parallels ( or modes ) in the game. #1, The Hunt for Evil. #2, A Hunt for the Heart. #3, A Hunt for the Lies.  #4, A Hunt for the Truth. and Parallel #5, Marathon of Death. The other reviewer explained the parallels quite well so I won't bore you with the details of each. Like any self respecting RPG there are many different elements in DS. There's platforming,  corruption, fighting, exploring, different endings, science fiction, time limits, monsters, babes, parallel universes, items to collect and use, conflicting realities, friends, enemies, evil islands, rebellions, and there is even a two player mode that can be unlocked. ( whew, that was a lot! ) Dark Savior for the Sega Saturn is a great game to play if you want something different in a RPG, hands down! The graphics are colorful and well drawn, and the music is good too! ( I love the battle music, it rocks ) So give it a try, you won't be sorry.  "" Happy Gaming!

Your character, Jones, works alone with a variety of weapons through 19 campaigns. Each one, like Splinter Cell, emphasizes using stealth and avoidance over in-your-face confrontation.
The weapon selection is impressive. There's everything from the basic Colt python and AK47 that we all know and love to the M104, LAW 80, twin UZI and RPG7. If you hit a situation where firepower is necessary, you've got it there.
There's thermal imaging and binoculars to help you plan your attack. On the downside, like several of the other stealth games, it assumes you will probably play a mission a few times to figure out the best way to avoid the paths of your enemies.
However, the single player missions are (like just about every other game I've played recently) mostly a training ground for the challenge of playing this on line. The AI in the game is reasonably good - but wait until you go up against other humans on line! That's where you really start to have some fun.
The graphics are rather good, but not as stunning as far as light and shadows as Splinter Cell was. Still, Splinter Cell was rather amazing, so it's not a bad thing to say it comes relatively close. Motion is smooth and the environments realistic. Sounds are realistic as well, with footsteps and mood music drawing you in.
A good game for those who have played through Splinter Cell and are ready to take that style of gameplay to the next level!",A great game for Splinter Cell enthusiasts,1047686400,2,,

It didn't feel like the PC game in any respects really. People who complained then, will now be totally happy. Big Red One not only looks fantastic (near PC graphics), it feels and plays just as great as it's PC brothers. I feel a hint of Medal of Honor European Assault every once and awhile but this game is far more polished and thought out. The storyline is a major draw in, offering some great character moments. I read some of the guys that starred in the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers do some voice work in the game, however I haven't picked up on it quite yet, although I've got some ideas. On thing is for certain...Mark Hammil (star of Big Red One movie from 1981) narrates this epic game and does a very nice job. I recently bought Brothers in Arms Earned in Blood for xbox aswell and if your asking me to make a buying decision for you I'd say...

1. Big Red One is more run and gun, Earned in Blood is tactical.

2. This game is far more family friendly, Earned in Blood ISN'T.

3. Both games offer unique gameplay and are both worth 50 bucks.

If your looking for a rich new experience that has the polish of a great PC game, please do yourself a favor and buy this game. There are at least 5 WWII themed games coming out for the Holidays this year and Big Red One is diffenetly a winner. The A.I. is revolutionary for a console game offering such epic action scenes. The weapons are standard fare in a WWII game, but are more enjoyable than ever, seeming more powerful. Levels are diverse and I was thouroly impressed with each one, the D-Day beach landing is a very special thing for me in this game as it was the recreation of this scene in Medal of Honor Frontline that sucked me into the WWII franchise. Activision and Tyrench's take on the greatest invasion of all time is incredibley intense. And yes I have managed to cruise through the game very fast. The Battle of the Bulge, as well as the early Africa levels are great, as are the Normandy levels (its just Normandy has been used so many times in videogames) The ending levels in Germany are very fun and you feel such a great sense of accomplishment after beating the game, which should take 12 to 14 hours. 10 out of 10.

Although the dialog is basically the same, the cut scenes and stages are different.  I'm glad I own and have played through both versions as the challenge is different for each version.

Based on my experience, I give the nod to the Wii version as the ""better"" verion, mostly because it's fun to use the Wii-mote to fight the ghosts (which I found to be more interactive than using the X-Box controller) and because you can play with two players in the Wii version.  This allowed my wife and I to play together, which was a blast.  It is still scary at certain parts even though it is more cartoonish than the highly detailed X-Box version.  Either way, if you like Ghostbusters, this is an extremely fun game.

If you ever wanted to walk around in the worlds showcased in such movies as Aliens and Event Horizon, or come face to face with creatures in Carpenter's The Thing, then this is the game you must play.

This game is gore infested. The only way to stop the Necromorphs is to dismember them, and even when you do, they keep coming! There are dark corners, pitch black hallways, and things jumping out at you - any seemingly empty room is a potential death trap. This is not a ""run and gun"" type game. If you try that, you will die quickly. Be prepared to explore a mysterious, gargantuan derelict - the planet-cracker ship known as the Ishimura.

The graphics are amazing as you would expect. The creature animations and the lighting effects are especially effective. The sound is what really gives this game its atmosphere...pipes fall and echo in the darkness, destroyed terminals sizzle randomly...all this serves to further immerse you in this hellish world. Level design is awesome - you will visit several working parts of the ship - you really get the feeling you are on a huge freighter lost in space. You even get to walk outside on the hull in some key ZERO GRAVITY situations! Excellent stuff, but still very dangerous!

There are plenty of weapons, ammo, suits, and health items to be found in the darkness or in the stores stationed throughout the ship. It might seem too convenient at first, but due to the nature of the game, you will need this as you can run out quick. Remember, you don't have a Rambo sized gun clip or anything like that...you're basically using what you find to scrape through to the next level or room. What you use and how you use it is totally up to you, which provides a nice level of customization according to he player's likes and dislikes.

A creepy story unfolds as to what happened to the Ishimura as you progress further into the ship's bowels. It is told through audio and text logs that you come across. You don't have to listen to or read them but it will enhance the journey if you do. There is also a handy directional line that you can call up at any time to take you to your next objective. Again, this is an optional thing and you could conceivably play the whole game without using it once. Your choice. Some of the mission objectives do become mundane after a while, but that isn't a huge negative by any means. The success here is the way you get sucked into the story and the environment from beginning to end.

In conclusion, this is a game where the developers clearly were fans of the subject and made the most of their opportunity. Be prepared to be scared out of your mind, relish in what an augmented mining tool can do to mutated flesh, and discover a terrifying story set in a dark and ominous future setting.

I hope this won't be the only time we visit this universe. It's not over...

The first portion is editorial; the second portion covers technical aspects and features.  Each section is broken up by CAPS to ensure for easier reading and ease of use; if you are looking for specific information, simply look for the CAPS headers]

The eight generation of video game consoles is upon us, with the Nintendo releasing the first console of that era, the Wii U. Nintendo has a lot riding on the Wii U. While the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii/dp/B0009VXBAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii</a>&nbsp;has been the most commercially successful console of its generation, the perception has been that the Wii is firmly for causal gamers, and the XBOX 360 and PlayStation 3 is for the hardcore gamers. Also, given the bumbled launch of the 3DS (Nintendo's most botched debut of new hardware, with the sole exception of Gunpei Yokoi's 1995 Virtual Boy), Nintendo has to get the Wii U right. Here are some concerns that Nintendo wants to address with the Wii U.

THE WII IS ONLY FOR CASUAL GAMERS: One item that effectively fueled that (largely incorrect) perception is the packaging of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-Sports/dp/B0017Q4DGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii Sports</a>"", which clearly demonstrated what the motion-controlled driven Wii was all about and what it was fully capable of accomplishing. Interestingly enough, the basic edition (covered in detail later in the review) does not include the Wii U's version of ""Wii Sports"", a game called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nintendo-Land/dp/B002I0K3M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nintendo Land</a>"". Most likely though hardcore gamers will want the Deluxe Edition due to the extra features included, including quadrupling storage space. It was only because of ""Wii Sports"" dethroned ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros/dp/B00004SVV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros.</a>"" that ""Super Mario Bros."" finally had to relinquish its title as the best selling video game of all time. ""Wii Sports"" moved over eighty million units, and according to the Nintendo channel people played that game a LOT.

BAD NETWORKING: Another notorious weakness of the Wii was its weak network infrastructure. Online gameplay is the order of the day, and Nintendo has been behind the eight ball for this generation due to poor implementation of online gaming. Although some Wii titles included online gaming (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mario-Kart-Wii-with-Wii-Wheel/dp/B000XJNTNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mario Kart Wii with Wii Wheel</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Bond-007-GoldenEye/dp/B003O6H7X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Bond 007: GoldenEye</a>"" come to mind), the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 offered much more robust gaming options in this milieu. ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Super-Mario-Bros-Wii/dp/B002BRZ9G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a>"", one of the biggest titles of the Wii era, notoriously did not include this much needed functionality.

LACK OF THIRD PARTY TITLES: One of the major selling points of any Nintendo console is the Nintendo IPs: we all know the only place you get Mario (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Super-Mario-Bros-U/dp/B002I0K3CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Super Mario Bros. U</a>) and all his various sub-series, Link, Samus, Pikmin, Super Smash Brothers, Kirby, Donkey Kong, Star Fox, Pokeman, Kid Icarus, Animal Crossing, Fire Emblem, The Legendary Starfly, etc, are on Nintendo hardware. As strong as these IPs are, to flourish Nintendo MUST have the support of third party developers. The Wii missed out on some of the biggest titles of the seventh generation, largely due to the radically different control scheme of the Wii compared to the other two consoles and the lack of HD support, as well as the required work to convert XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 titles to the Wii.

The Wii U fixes the issues that were keeping away the third party games. Despite all the brouhaha regarding the GamePad, in one way Nintendo has become more conservative in their approach to third party developers. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nintendo-Wii-U-Pro-Controller-Black/dp/B009AFLXQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nintendo Wii U Pro Controller - Black</a>&nbsp;(largely similar to the XBOX 360 and Playstation 3 controllers) appear to be built directly for the third party developers to be able publish titles across multiple platforms with very little technical adjustments required to adjust for each console. Bringing the Wii U into closer technical proximity to its brethren means that developers won't have to have the added cost of having a production team set aside especially for the Nintendo console. The launch shows promise that third party developers are getting behind the Wii U, with exclusive titles of ""Bayonette 2"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rayman-Legends/dp/B008AU4YEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rayman Legends</a>"", as well as game series making their debut on a home Nintendo console (""Assassin's Creed 3"",""Darksiders II"", ""Mass Effect 3"") and also ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"". And rather than limiting and potentaily discouraging multi-platform titles with their radically different controllers, it's quite possible the Wii U GamePad will really strengthen the Wii editions of their perspective titles, affording gameplay design options unavailable on the other consoles.

And, just maybe, my dreams of playing a current generation ""Elder Scrolls"" game on a Nintendo Console is this much closer to a reality. Only time will tell how the eight generation works out and who comes out on top in the market. Even though Nintendo had the weakest system of the seventh generation, they came out on top despite some obvious deficiencies. While the Wii U can give you the impression Nintendo is trying to get out from behind the eight ball (to use the pool analogy a second time), but remember: the Wii dominated, and I have a feeling that the Wii U will dominate as well.

TWO  IMPORTANT POINTS OF KNOWELDGE FOR NEW WII U OWNERS: Before we get into the technical aspects, there are two items of which you should be aware

1.  SYSTEM UPDATE: You must run a required system update (available at launch) to use the Miiverse, Wii U Chat, eShop, in addition to backwards capability for playing Wii games on the Wii U.  To perform the system update, you must have an Internet connection, so if you purchase the Wii U and do not have an Internet Connection you will not have these functionalities.

2.  AUTOMATIC SYSTEM SHUTDOWN: Please note that in the system configuration options, the Wii U is automatically set to shut down after a certain amount of time after no system input.  If you pause your game and come back an hour later, you may very well find the system has been shut down due to this option, losing any progress you have made; you will want to disable or recongiure this setting if idle time is a concern for you.

3. TVii will not be available until sometime in December.

That largely concludes the editorial section of the review. The following content will focus on the technical features of the Wii U, as well as the new features that the Wii U offers as opposed to the Wii.

STANDARD EDITION (Suggested Retail: $299.99) vs. DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION (Suggest retail: $349.99)- Here is a break down of what is in the two different launch versions. The Standard is White and the Deluxe is Black. Also important to know: the Standard Set and the Deluxe Set DO NOT INCLUDE the necessary AV cables to hook up the Wii U to a standard definition TV. You will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. Also, PLEASE NOTE neither edition include Wii Remotes.

STANDARD EDITION:
-Wii U Console with 8GB of Internal Storage
-Wii U Gampad
-Sensor Bar
-GamePad AC Adapter
-Wii U AC Adapter
-HDMI Cable.

DELUXE/PREMIUM EDITION:
-Wii U Console with 32 GB of internal storage (four times as much as the 8GB of the Standard)
-Sensor Bar
-GamePad AC Adapter
-Wii U AC Adapter
-HDMI Cable
-Wii U GamePad Cradle, GamePad Stand, and Console Stand (for those wanting their console to stand vertically like the Wii rather than lying flat horizontally)
-The NintendoLand game.

Looking at the list, the chief differences between the two editions is the 32GB of storage as opposed to the 8GB, the three individual stands (although the Wii U Console Stand is comprised of two different pieces) , and the inclusion of ""NintendoLand"".

CONSOLE: Like its predecessor the Wii, the Wii U features a brand new and innovative controller scheme. The GamePad, the Wii's new controller, is attracting a good deal of attention, as the controller functions almost as a separate gaming device in conjunction with the Wii U. The new controller is the GamePad. Like the Wii before it, the Wii U is inextricably tied up in its controller and the potential of added functionality via the controller. The main driving design ideology behind the controller is pushing what Nintendo calls ""Asymmetrical Gaming"". In plain English, this means that by virtue of the Gamepad individual players can assume different roles in a gaming session. For example, in ""New Super Mario Bros. U"", players with the Wii Remote can focus on clearing the course, whereas the player with the GamePad can actually assist the other players by creating platforms and clearing obstacles from the other players' paths.

CONTROLLER SPECIFICATIONS: At launch additional Gamepads will not be available. The Wii U will only support two Gamepads at once, and performance will suffer when running two GamePads at once. Here are the features of the Gamepad. The Wii U can support four Wii Remotes and one GamePad. At the time of launch it is unknown if it can support two GamePads and four Wii Remotes at once.

-6.2 inch (15.7 cm) 16:9 resistive touchscreen
-Functions as an Infared Universal TV remote controller, regardless if the Wii U is powered on.  Syncing the Gamepad as a Universal remote is very simple.
-Gaming Functionality independent of the Wii U. Nintendo has described video game consoles as being ""parasites"" to TVs, and the Wii U resolves that issue with this innovative controller. If other people in the family or those you live with want to watch television, you can still play games using the Wii U GamePad, completely separate from the Wii U. The GamePad can also play videos as well.
-Supports social media, such as Facebook and Twitter
-Internet browsing on both the Gamepad and TV
-Able to draw pictures and upload these pictures into the Miiverse
-Users can replace controller batteries, unlike Apple products.  Battery life is 3-5 hours; after approximately 500 charges, battery will only retain about 70% of its charge.  The Wii U Pro controller also features swapable batteries.
-Share content (such as video) to the TV
-Stylus (like the Nintendo DS)
-Includes camera, microphone, and a 3.5MM headphone jack along with volume control and stereo speakers. The GamePad supports video chat.
-Built-in 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and a geomagnetic sensor
-Near-Field Communication included, where you can get stand alone devices that the Gamepad will interact with if placed in close proximity to the Gamepad.
-Two analogue thumbsticks that function as buttons when physically depressing them
-Select, Start, Home and Power buttons
A/B/X/Y face buttons, L/R bumper buttons and ZL/ZR trigger buttons
-Controller sync button
-Motion control (this is a no brainer, given the legacy of the Wii), rumble vibrations (like the N64 Rumble Pack)
-Rechargeable battery housed inside the device.
-You can power on the Wii U from the Gamepad
-IMPORTANT TO NOTE: the Wii U Gamepad is NOT backward compatible with Virtual Console/Wii Ware titles.  You can only play these titles on the TV via regular Wii controllers.

PRO CONTROLLER: Nintendo is also releasing what is called a Wii U Pro Controller, which is largely identical to the Wii Classic Controller Pro.  The Pro Controller is sold seperately. The Pro Controller is wireless, also has an internal battery and clickable analogue sticks and buttons on the top of the device like the L and R button from the Super NES controller.  This controller will last up to 80 hrs on a single battery charge. Recharging to maximum capacity takes 4.5 hrs.

HD GAMING: Another sore spot for Wii players has been Nintendo's lack of support for HD gaming. This has been fully addressed in the Wii U. One of the most famous pre-release pictures of what the Wii U can do graphically has been Link form ""The Legend of Zelda"" fighting a giant spider that resembles Gohma. The artwork is gorgeous and really shows what the Wii U can do artistically graphically.

Please note you must have an HD TV that supports the resolution to maximize the full potential of the Wii U. Again PLEASE NOTE you will need to either purchase the AV cable in addition to the console itself if you have a standard TV, or use the Wii's AV cables if you have one. The Wii U only comes with an HDMI cable. The Wii U supports the following video resolutions: 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p.

BACKWARDS CAPABILITY: The Wii U supports all Wii peripherals/titles. However Wii titles will still be in their normal resolution of 480p, so no HD gaming for you on Wii titles, my friends. Likewise (and this isn't surprising, since later versions of the Wii removed this functionality as well), the Wii U will not support Gamecube titles. Nintendo has not confirmed whether they will release Gamecube titles as future digital releases at the time of launch.

Also (and this is huge), you can transfer ALL of your Wii data to the Wii U (retail data, downloaded content, game history, etc), including Virtual Console and Wiiware titles. Nintendo has attracted the ire of the gaming community from its rather backward network setup for the Wii - rather than VC and Wiiware purchases being linked to online accounts like Apple's iTunes, the purchases are tied to the individual system and a lot of people (myself included) were worried about what would happen to all the titles we bought for the VC and Wiiware. It's quite easy to have a lot of money tied up in those types of purchases. Thankfully this problem has been resolved.  At the end of the review is the step-by-step process in transferring your data.

NINTENDO NETWORK AND NETWORK ID ACCOUNTS: Finally, Nintendo is addressing its weak network infrastructure that so limited the Wii. The Wii U is thankfully account-based like iTunes, with one Wii U supporting up to twelve unique accounts. Like the 3DS and the Wii, the Wii U will include its own version of the eShop, will full length games available for download upon their release dates. Also if you purchase the Delux Set you will get a Nintendo Network Premium account. This is a two year subscription account and features discounts and exclusive content.

Nintendo Network comprises the following: Nintendo eShop, Miiverse, Nintendo TVii, and Wii U Chat.  In order to use these different components, you will need to register your Nintendo Network ID.  This Nintendo Network ID will replace the previously cumbersome Friend Codes.  To register your Nintendo ID account, you will need to enter an ID, a password, your birthday, gender, location, and email address.

In order to use the Wii U, you will have to set up an account.  The Wii U can support up to twelve individual accounts.  Once you set up your user accounts, you will select your own Mii each time you start up the Wii U.  Each account will manage the following: Game settings, Game Saves, Internet Bookmarks, and Playhistory  After selecting your account upon system startup, you will be taken to the Waruwaru Plaza, a giant gathering spot for Miis.

Your purchases from the Nintendo eShop will be registered to your specific account; however, any account on your Wii U can play software from the eShop that is purchased under a specific account.  You will be able to use the Nintendo Network ID on non-Nintendo devices (such as PCs and Smartphones) in 2013 to access Nintendo services such as Miiverse and the eShop

NINTENDO TVii - Available only in the US and Canada, TVii allows Wii U owners to watch TV content from multiple online sources, such as Netflix, Hulu, and even your DVR or Tivo, although most likely you will have to connect your DVR/Tivo to the Wii U as the Wii U doesn't have that functionality.

MiiVERSE - Nintendo's vision of a social network, the Miiverse is essentially just that: a social network. The big question regarding the Miiverse is content moderation, which at the time of launch has not been fully explained by Nintendo. Like the Nintendo Channel for the Wii, the Miiverse collects data on what games are being played globally and will work as a key marketing tool in pushing the big games everyone is playing. Thanks to current technology, game companies can get data about what people are actually playing that back in the 1980s and 1990s they could only dream of.

You can easily switch between gaming and the MiiVerse, asking for assistance, bragging, or making comments, and then seamlessly go back to the gameplay.  The Miiverse also has filters for spoilers; when posting to the Miiverse, the player can mark the post as a spoiler, and  you can configure your system to ingore these posts.  Also, if enough players vote a post as a spoiler, the system will mark the post as a spoiler.

The Miiverse is built directly into the system, so all Wii U games are compatible.  Game developers can all use the Miiverse for added functionality; if a player fails multiple times in one specific spot, the game can display comments made by other players regarding that exact spot.

INTERNET, MANUAL, AND ACHIEVEMENTS: Wii U will not feature Achievements or Trophies.  You can pause your game play, by pressing the home button and on the Gamepad open up the Web Browser, and then likewise return to gameplay.  Although there is some brief printed materials, the Wii U Manual is digitally stored and accessible within the system itself.

I enjoyed this game thoroughly even though some reviewers didn't like the backtracking through areas they had already been.  I thought the developers incorporated what could be a boring repetitive aspect in to a convincing part of the story so it didn't seem repetitive to me.

Well you can even make the player look like you. Mine is almost a spitting image. Good looking guy! But seriously, you can change all his apparel, get sponsorships from pretty much every major golf company in the world (Callaway, Nike, Taylor Made etc..), and even buy new celebrations in the Pro Shop.

(From Code Geass) then go ahead! I always had a lot of fun with this. not only could I play as my favorite characters in my favorite robots but I could also choose who would follow me into battle as my partners. the maps are HUGE and there is hundreds of enemies coming at you at once. it's a really fun game if you like to fly around and blow things up.

As you play the game, the character you play as and his/her partners will gain battle experience points you can use to upgrade his strength, armor, and special abilities. you'll be able to dish out more damage, take a serious beating, and even use special weapons during combat. however you can only upgrade the characters who have been in battle. characters who haven't seen one day of fighting cannot be upgraded so make sure not to leave the characters you like out of the fun or else by the time you use them, they'll be as soft as tissue paper against a powerful enemy. you can also use team attacks where all 3 members of your squad combine their strength into one big attack to wipe out dozens of enemies at once.

The game does have one BIG downside and it would happen to be the story. it starts off pretty decent. on a planet named Era, human colonists create an army of androids that were meant to protect them but instead turned against them and wiped out all life on the planet. however, one android named Autumn-4 remained loyal to the humans and she was given orders to transport a powerful space craft known as the A.R.K to another planet where she would then use the ship's cloning technology to revive the humans killed on Era. but when she was about to leave, the Seasons (The name of the main enemy of the game) stopped her and tried to seize control of the A.R.K. in a desperate attempt to escape, she meant to use the ship's warp drive and teleport out of Era's atmosphere into space. but something went wrong and it instead created wormholes to alternant universes. suddenly, large robots piloted by familiar anime characters started to fall out of the wormholes and into Era's atmosphere. Autumn-4 thought nothing of this at first, but then she saw how easily these mechs from other worlds overpowered the Seasons and wiped out hundreds in mere minutes. then Autumn-4 came up with a new plan. she started to gather the pilots from other worlds together and made a deal with all of them. if they destroy the Seasons for her, she would send them all back to where they came from.

Sounds like a pretty decent start right? well unfortunately, most of the entire story revolves around Macross: Frontier and Code Geass. I know those were popular animes at the time, but a good portion of the game is spent on those characters and their enemies, and the others such as Gundam, Super Robot Wars, and Full Metal Panic almost disappear from the story entirely. Macross: Frontier is given animated cutscenes that cannot be skipped, you fight their enemies several times, and they get 2 special levels were you fight in their world. this game might as well be called Macross and Code Geass: With Gundam And Other Animes because those 2 are given a royal treatment in this game and everyone else was there just as characters to be played as. that's like having a Super Smash Bros game and the story mode revolves entirely around Legend Of Zelda and everyone else is just background characters. I hear a lot of fans were pissed off about this because if felt as if the writers were playing favorites and saw no value in the other animes. so the story of this game is completely out of balance.

But if you enjoy giant robot animes and Armored Core, then this is a game for you because you'll love flying through the air and blowing up the villains of your favorite animes. but if you hate Macross and Code Geass, I suggest you look elsewhere because this game is almost consumed by them.

It was believe there was going to be another game after this one. they did say, ""A.C.E 3 is the last for PS2, and A.C.E R is the first for PS3"" but it's been 5 years now and still no news of another game. but hopefully next time, they'll keep the story balanced.",Another Century's Episode: R,1447459200,,,

This game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers, each is unique with unique speeds, skills, traction breaks and so on, each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured. Along the way you pick up ""cash"" from bets that you come in first, second or third, then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer.

5.0,False,"10 15, 2010",A1VBMM3SCBOA9M,B002I0J6DC,B. Cooper,"Not every game can garner a perfect score, and not every game should.  However, when a company like Mercury Steam receives less praise than its efforts demand I am COMPELLED to offset the press. Like a film paying homage to a legendary director, Castlevania strives to create a unique identity by interweaving radically new concepts within the scope of the genre's hardest hitting greats.  Lords of Shadow may not be the Castlevania we expected, but it is undeniably a labor of love.  So raise that 7.5 to an 8.9, and let me tell you why!

FIRST...THE NEGATIVES:
-Facial Expressions are minimal, lip synch is decent but not perfect.

-Chupacabra sections seem forced. Chupacabras remove all powers and artifacts and tell you to find them and recover what you lost.  Seems detrimental to the storyline in that the little bastards can take away all the powers even the Dark Lords cannot.  ""Yoda"" style voicework is annoying at best.

-Zobek (Patrick Stewart) narrative sections are necessary within the separate level construct, but seem somewhat overacted.

-The character transformation of Gabriel is clearly stated in the scripted text but is not quite believable within the gameplay or video sequences.

THE POSITIVES:
+Art Direction is Outstanding.  There are LOTS of different enemies, a HUGE assortment of bosses (only one minor boss is repeated), and PHENOMENAL background detail within levels.  It seems to push the PS3 graphics engine to the limit (Not quite as polished/smooth as less detailed levels in games like God of War).

+Music is Original, Epic, and Varied.  Always works well within the context of the environment.  Orchestral score easily blends with gothic atmosphere of game.

+Combat is Intense and Requires Strategy.  Several reviewers playing on the easiest settings seem to have prematurely dismissed Castlevania:LOS as yet another hack-and-slash. However, upping the difficulty reveals a subtle level of complexity and variety not usually found in the action/adventure genre.  Each battle requires you to carefully execute a combination of DIFFERENT moves without being hit to refill your magic gauge.  Your magic gauge then refills your health IF and only IF you can land successful hits within different combo techniques.  There are rarely any health fountains, and you are forced to regain your own health through combat.  A button masher game???  Maybe if you play on Ninja Dog.  I utilized almost every different combo throughout each fight and had to learn each boss to proceed.  Combat system is almost as rewarding as Demons Souls if you play on a hard enough setting.

+Only a few Chupacabra scenes which are over relatively quickly (Mercury Steam- TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SEQUEL!!)

+Sound Production/Effects are Top Notch.  Belmont's whip has a truly distinct feel and every magic power/combo feels powerful and unique.

+Using the Whip feels remarkably different than any weapon in other action games.  Platforming using the chain whip is a fantastic and surprisingly well-realized combination. (Consider Indiana Jones stuck in a dark fantasy novel)

+Quick time events utilizing a dual-overlapping sphere method (press any button when they overlap) is a HUGE improvement over God of War quick time events.  All finisher events can be seen as they are executed.  Player's attention can be focused on the entire screen when executing these buttons.  Reaction time is tested over button familiarity.

+Every enemy has a background story that fits within the setting of the story.  Almost all enemies are extremely fun to fight, require different strategies and are interesting to read about.

+Extras include a TON of artwork broken down into each level.

+Storyline is strong and does not borrow directly from any other games.  Epilogue truly sets apart Castlevania as unique and places the reasons for the story into context.

+Physics system is excellent.  Camera is fixed but works very well.  Other press reviews have stated the camera can be problematic.  I found it to be no worse than any other action adventure title out there on par with the fixed camera God of War series.  Fixed camera sections for Titans are a HUGE improvement upon the constantly readjusting camera on Shadow of the Colossus.

+Replayability is high due to levels being divided into short stages, and upgrades being scattered similar to Metroid upgrades (must return after gaining new powers).  Each stage offers a specific challenge.

+Polished game with little to no bugs

+Puzzles never feel forced.  With the exception of magic infused rune puzzles, the majority are very well executed. A few puzzles later in the game are actually quite brilliant!  As a sidenote, the game always lets you choose to purchase the answer to the puzzle with earned experience points.  Why is this a negative on IGN/Gamespot reviews?  If the player ever becomes stuck, you could just look up the answer online anyway.  I don't believe a game should be criticized because it knows that if you aren't smart enough to find the answer you will still want to proceed.  In addition, I never found any puzzle that required me to use a skill I hadn't used in 5 hours (as a review stated).  This is probably because the reviewer was playing on easy and never had to use any other combos like somebody playing on normal or hard settings.

So why did this game not achieve a higher score?  I think that in part it has to do with bias towards the shift from a 2d series.  This may not feel like other Castlevania games, but I can tell you that the atmosphere truly carries over even if the gameplay does not.  I believe this game has an identity all its own.  It borrows from other games, but only in an effort to pay homage and to improve upon what is already great.  Mercury Steam truly deserves recognition for the work they put into this title.  The ending sequence for the 2nd Lord of Shadows has more action than a run away mine cart.  (Check out ""the Devil's Mine Ride"" on youtube for my analogy)

A few minor issues prevent this game from rising into the elite 9.0+ scoring bracket.  However, compared to the other 7.5 games out there, Castlevania TRULY outshines the competition.  It may not be a 10/10, but decide for yourself if it deserves at least the 8.9 I would give.  Playing a game is supposed to be fun, and that is exactly what this game does right.

And I can't forget those who are inexperience and those who love to learn something new! Don't get me wrong, but you'll find it hard to follow at first but you'll get use to it after numerous tries. The soundtrack is awesome, however there are some new skool songs that shouldn't be on there. I want songs that are dance songs! Not something slow and freaky and stuff that you would hear at a typical night club.

Here are some artists that I always go back to whenever I play.
Naughty By Nature, TLC, Outkast, B.o. B., New Boyz, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, Run DMC, Sugar Hill Gang, Mark Morrison, Kid Cudi, Q-Tip, Snoop Dogg and Pharrell.

I love the old school 90's and 80's tracks because they contain real dance moves and they are definitely stuff that can get you pumped.  Unlike the other dance games, they contain dance moves that don't even go to the beat. When it's off beat you're either doing something silly or fake. There are some songs on here that do that and in my opinion those are the songs that I don't go back to. I also love whoever choreographed the b-boy moves (found in Run Dmc, Sugar Hills Gang, Outkast, and the other songs that I forget to mention). Go to training mode, you can actually learn real dance moves. One thing that was missing from this game is DLC! And one minor thing, scoreboards are not viewable on the main menu.

This game has a lot of potential and I hope they continue making more Hip-Hop dance games. And I hope that they throw in a full load of dance songs!

Bethesda graphics and character physics are a little unique in and of themselves, they take a little getting used to but I think you'll end up liking them for the most part.  The game was also a little slow getting started for me with very little tutorial as to what all of the options you have are and what they mean.  My basic break down...

Pros:
-The graphics a pretty.  Not the best but they still look really good.
-The weapon choices are astronomical.  You can use just about anything you can pickup, which is just about anything.  You can even build your own weapons and maintain them for top quality.  I like that the weapon declines in time and hurts the amount of damage you do as well as your accuracy.
-S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is a cool system of stats
-I love games where you can search dead bodies as well as pick pocket live ones.
-decent quests with a HUGE map area.  Approximately 16 SQ miles according to creators
-good character interaction and dialog with a choice based system that does affect how people interact with you.
-Fast map travel around the wasteland.

Cons:
-VATS...kind of a pro but more con because, if YOU CHOOSE to use the VATS system that so many people whine about, you cannot skip the slow motion while other enemies still attack you.  Plus it can definitely cheapen the game play experience if you're more of a 1st person shooter fan rather than an RPG gamer.
-Very little tutorial on the stats so they can be pretty confusing for a while.
-The wasteland can take very long periods of time to walk around with sometimes very little enemy interaction...a littel on the boring side at times.
-The night to day effect is awesome...unless you are waiting for shops to reopen and you don't have a place to sleep.

Overall Bethesda did a great job and seemed to put a lot of thought into this game.  It's a little difficult to get in to for the casual gamer like myself.  But I love RPGs and RPG/FPSs like KOTOR, Mass Effect, Jade Empire, Bio Shock and Fable.

Yes, it was that hard for me. (Probably it reflects my standing as a Ninja, eh?). But I managed to pull through convincingly at the end (with a lot of thought put into it) and the experience was just rewarding. To finish what I believe to be the Game of the Year on such a high was a deeply satisfying experience.

The next time, I played the game on successive mode, and to my shock, I was able to finish it in less than 12hrs!.

No it was not because Ninja Gaiden became easier (it gets tougher actually!), but I found certain subtleties in Ryu's combat I didn't know existed and learnt to use them intuitively. In short, Ninja Gaiden teaches a willing student a lot more than what the student perceived the first time. It isn't unfair, it just rewards a gamer whose adept and skillful at play. Ultimately, the more you learn, the more u'll come to appreciate this fantastic work of art.

Story:

Simple and straightforward. For centuries, the Clan of the Dragon Lineage has protected the Dark Dragon Blade, a legendary sword of unimaginable evil, that when wielded in the wrong hands, would unleash unspeakable horror upon the world. When the blade is stolen and the village is massacred, you, as Ryu Hayabusa, the last man standing, seeks to avenge the death of your fellow clan members by pursuing your mysterious and sinister enemy. You carry with you, the Dragon Blade, another legendary sword that is the counter part of the Dark Dragon Blade. The one who wields this to perfection will have nothing to fear, not even its twin-sister.

Yes, to many (including me sometimes), the story starts on a strong note, but becomes second nature. The plot as the game progresses is trivial. However, a game of this quality needs only a few strings attached together to bring forth a conclusion. Because the beauty of the game lies somewhere else.

Graphics:

I said somewhere else....the beauty starts here. I have played Halo and had the opinion it was the most impressive looking game on any platform. I am sure most of you would feel the same with fond memories. But NG is THE defining game for graphics. It is cutting edge. Everthing, from character modelling to environment rendering is beyond compare. Mesmerising. Ryu himself is perfectly rendered, and fluidity of combat is something to be seen. Everthing looks 'shiny' that adds to the overall feel of awe. Each object has been rendered in great detail and texture rendering is pitch perfect. Astonishingly the game doesn't slow one bit even though it could choke most high end computers. Till now, I had a limited opinion of the XBOX (maybe coz' I don't use it too often).I had no idea of its power, until now. I am proud to own it. Trust me, this is a system seller and consoles other than XBOX cannot run this game. They just cannot. It is too taxing on the hardware. I feel sorry for you is you don't have this console.

Gameplay:

If graphics is the cream, then the gameplay is the icing on the cake. This is my first Ninja game,so my opinion is not derived out of comparing with other similar titles. From what I have seen, the gameplay is unrivalled. You don't wield guns and bombs (though your foes do!) ; it is all melee combat with a dose of shuriken and bow shooting. The fighting is intense and fast. It involves extremely intelligent play and rewards players who use brain than brawn. More than anything, Ryu is successful when he understands his foes. Everthing you do involves instinct and adriotness. This along with graphics is alone enough to make NG a killer. But no, there is more...

Replay:

NG is long. It spreads across 16 Chapters and each level, let alone a chapter, is massive and different. When you finish the game the first time, you unlock more difficult modes and in successive play mode, you carry with you certain precious items from the first play, to trade for some important stuff earlier than usual. Also you would want to experiment with the weapons you have and perfect urself in all combos. You will discover that some work better than others at certain situations u didn't know the first time. U'll also learn to play with a greater sense of speed to achieve higher Ninja rankings. Along with that, u get to unlock the original NG classics, the cinematics and the soundtrack. Hence all this adds tremendous replay value. It goes without saying you gotta be a Ninja by now or die in the first level itself!.

Sound:

The minute you listen to a track called 'Vanished memories' that plays when Ryu first enters his massacred village, you'd be baying for more. It is simply inspiring. A little bit of Japanese, a little bit of percussion. The end effect is just an uplifting piece of orchestra. U'll feel the same throughout the game with different set pieces and each level has distinctive music that characterizes the setting and the tension.

The ambient sounds are also terrific and offer great variety of effects like when u smash u'r sword on different surface or foes. Top notch.

Cinematics:

Watch them to come to the conclusion that they are unmatched! Warcraft 3:Reign of Chaos (PC) was stupendous, but this is of a different league. 15 high quality movies that can numb your senses. They don't really push forward the story. But thatz besides the point isn't it?. They are there to reward you for a job well done. And add to this, the engine rendered cutscenes of such fluidity that u'd believe they were pre-animated. Phew!.

Overall:

If you are an FPS player, then NG may not be for you coz itz combat can either be glorious or totally frustrating. The camera also makes life difficult sometimes and you'd end up dying, which can be a total let down. But then, such minor flaws cannot overshadow a game of such quality. Ninja Gaiden's presentation has been detailed to perfection, even the end credits. You cant help but admire its authority over all other games, even if you aren't a fan of this genre. More importantly, you'll come to appreciate the sheer programming skill required to execute this game and believe me, it is ingenious. This game is now the benchmark, the pinnacle of programming.

this is how i went about it:
turn off the fan so nothing will be floating around and stick to the screen
take the cloth and wipe down the screen (i did it hesitantly because i get scared that these wipes/cloths will scratch the screen but they dont. :) )
make sure you get every little tiny piece of dust off the screen
then take the wet wipe, wipe it down and it will leave a bit of a residue after drying
that's when you take out the dry wipe and wipe it away
from there take the micro cloth and give it another wipe down
peel off the sticker from the SP, line it up, and gently let it drop onto the screen and spread out like magic.

no bubbles.

although i did have one bubble in the middle of the screen at first i fixed it by gently lifting the closest corner to where the bubble was and pressed down where the bubble was as i re-applied it. now its perfect. you cant even tell and the screen looks even sharper. other SP's would lose stickiness and create more air bubbles but this one really did its thing. (be gentle and patient if you have to do this because it REALLY STICKS once its on.)

5.0,False,"02 15, 2012",A2R0O174GE9GA2,B005IMVP0O,Joseph Born,"The PlayStation Vita is a triumph in gaming technology. Sony promised us a lot when they announced the Vita, and they've delivered. The Vita blurs the line between handheld and console gaming. Like the PS3, the Vita is capable of delivering detailed graphics, a ""console-like"" gaming experience, and will satisfy the most serious gamer. I was hesitant that the Vita would be as revolutionary as some were saying it would be, luckily the Vita is everything Sony would be and then some.
The Vita is a handheld gaming system that was developed by Sony, who are best known for their line of Playstation gaming consoles. Sony has released other handheld gaming systems, like the PSP and PSP Go, but the Vita greatly surpasses those in quality, entertainment, and potential. It is my layman's opinion that the Vita will be the go-to system for handheld gaming for the next couple of years. I've only played a few games for it so far... Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Dungeon Hunter Alliance, and wipEout 2048. I can honestly admit that this was as enjoyable as playing a game on the PS3. A quick note on the ""backplay"" the Vita offers. You can play PSP games and any ones you download from the store such as PS1 classics. [This feature isn't available yet, but it will be soon. I will update my review as soon as it is]
The Vita is capable of a lot of things. To start off, the graphics are on par with that of a PS3 game. Uncharted: Golden Abyss had the same quality graphics of its console counterpart, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. I'm hoping (and excited) to see more developers utilize the Vita to its fullest capabilities.
The controls are much improved over the Playstation Portable. Like a controller it now has dual analogue sticks. This improves the gameplay experience vastly. The touch screen has been fine tuned as well. It has HD quality and very nice looking. The motion sensors are great and have been improved as well, the gyroscope particularly,. Games integrate the three to great effect. I love being able to aim and then use the motion sensitivity to fine tune my aiming.
Built in WiFi and the option to use AT&T (Or eventually another mobile internet provider) make connecting to the Internet easy. Accessing the PlayStation Network allows you to download games to your Vita, synch trophies, and access other media. There is also a built-in GPS.
The Vita is slim and easy to hold/play with two hands. It is relatively lightweight for a handheld. In some ways I enjoyed playing my Vita more than either of my console systems. The dual motion/analog gameplay is enjoyable and thanks to the quality/resolution of the screen it looks great.
There isn't a doubt in my mind that the Vita is the best handheld system available currently. It may have an expensive price, but it is worth it. I could easily see myself playing games on this more in the future, maybe more so than my Xbox or PS3. If you have any interest in getting one, I would highly recommend it with Uncharted: Golden Abyss being one of the first games to try out.

One of the few recent games that truly lived up to its hype, RE4 is a delightfully scary experience wrapped in stunning graphics and tight controls. It's a whole different game from the previous installments in the series, and looks to be the model for the next few games to come. There's more bullets and more weapons maybe, but that doesn't make the game any easier. Also appreciated is how lengthy the overall quest is, and for the first time Capcom has not resorted to tired fetch quests and backtracking.

Right now there's two versions of this game (with a third coming to PC). The Gamecube version is the original, and has slightly better graphics and better controls (since it was specifically designed for Nintendo's console). It's also slightly cheaper as a player's choice title. The PS2 port loses a bit in the graphics department, but packs in a bunch of bonus content such as side missions, extra costumes, weapons, and story content. It's also in anamorphic widescreen, whereas the Gamecube one is letterboxed. It might sound like the PS2 game has more value, but overall the two versions are about the same.

I loved this game.  I am actually surprised that even more people have not played it.  It has the highest rating ever from PC Gamer (98%).  Think about that:  Alpha Centauri is 2% away from being considered The Perfect Game.
Why? Strategy that is detailed but intuitive.  Diplomacy that is believable and matters.  Game balance.  A fun storyline.  An intelligent AI that does not have to cheat to win.
But by far my favorite part of the game is the technology aspect of the game.  Each new future technology (some truly vague) is introduced with a sound byte from a faction leader, but more important is WHAT these leaders say. Philosophy, religion, literature, hard science, Emmanuel Kant, Aristotle, even Military Cadences are used to provide atmosphere to the game.  This is a game that respects the gameplayer's intelligence.  Additionally, the future technology tree has been well researched.  Just go to the back of the well-produced Alpha Centuari manual to see the vast bibliography of Science Textbooks, Hard Science Fiction (Think Stanley Kubrik's 2001) and Soft Science Fiction (Think Star Wars or Star Trek) that the game draws influence from.  I have a PhD in Molecular biology, and I must endorse the technology tree as an excellent model for speculating how humanity's future knowledge-base may be represented. Particularly interesting is how different civilizations are based on faction instead of nationality.  However, nationalistic stereotypes are represented.  The communist/socialist faction is represented by Chairman Yang (Chinese).  The Gaia mentality is represetned by Lady Dierdre Skye (Celtic/Irish).  The University faction is represented by a Russian Scientist (Academician Prokhor Zakharov), and the UN peacekeeping faction by a Ghandi-like figure in Commissioner Pravin Lal.  There are others, to be sure, but these are the most egregious.
Regardless, the game is an outstanding mix of fun, a stytle of gameplay that does not require excessive detail to be considered intelligent, great presentation values, and an overall attention to polish even in the smallest details.  There is precious little that could be changed in this game.  To quote Salieri describing Mozart's music, ""Displace one note and there would be diminishment.

Additionally they've improved the tools as well (you don't have to draw circles to magnify) and this DS touch version is a bit more forgiving than the first one. The graphics are better (which would be expected anyway since its 2008 now). The colors are also easier on the eyes than the first one.

The first one I found an exercise in frustration (to say the least!). It was extremely unforgiving of tiny imperfections. Some may like that. I don't. I'm more of a casual gamer who plays video games for pure enjoyment and not for competition or to ""beat"" a game or what have you.

Had I not played the first one after I got this one I would have wondered what all the original reviews were about--since people complained that the game was so hard. This one is no cake walk (even on easy level!) but the touch screen responds SO SO SO much better than the first one...you'll really be able to tell the difference in game play. The first one still shows ""wiggly"" lines even when you really do draw straight ones.

I write my reviews mostly for the more casual gamer who games to escape and have fun. I really can't say if you are more of a hard core gamer or like insanely difficult games whether you'll like this version or not...but you can alter the difficulty to hard if you like so that may satisfy.

Overall HIGHLY recommended. I have put about 10 hours in and am on level 6 and am really enjoying myself. Its not easy---but it is rewarding enough so you can push yourself to play that operation just one more time.

I was/am a huge fan of Oblivion. I really enjoyed Dragon Age but I am more a first shooter type and managing a group is less entertaining for me than single player/single character.
I was interested by The Witcher 2 so I read many reviews and something coming back all the time was indeed the mention of the original game.
So I tried it, hell, it was only 9.99$. It took about 2 hours to download the 11GB of the game and I started playing it. I am still playing it now.

The good:
- One of the most interesting story I have ever played so far. I am only at chapter two and I must have played at least 20 hours already. Easily...but I like to take my time and play all the side quests before progressing on the main one.
- Well designed game.
- Unusual fighting style but it gets quickly easy.
- A bit more realistic than Oblivion as far as looting. You cannot carry 20 armors in an invisible backpack. You have very limited slots for weapons and none other than your body for the armor.
- Excellent Alchemy and Ingredient collecting process.
- Works very well in 3D (with Nvidia 3D glasses).

The less good:
- I would have liked a possibility to gain skills at negociations, specifically to buy or sell items at a better price.
- A few minor visual bugs. For instance, the dwarves often have their right hand graphically messed up; it will form a columns towards the ground. A female monster (forgot her name) has her breasts doing the same thing but going down to her hips... I am quite sure it is a bug, otherwise...

A solid 5 stars. It has replaced Oblivion now as my favorite RPG game and I hope the new one will live up to its predecessor. I will certainly add more impressions when I finish it but it won't certainly be soon.",Excellent surprise!,1314057600,,{'Platform:': ' PC Download'},

5.0,False,"01 3, 2017",ACTUPMCDDJEBN,B0009UBR3A,D-Fay,"I find myself writing a review for the original version of this game a little more than 10 years since it's initial release on both the Nintendo GameCube, and the Wii.  Let me start of by saying that The Legend of Zelda series is my all-time favorite game series, which is a lot in and of itself; video games are my favorite past-time.  While I have already done a review for the Wii U Remaster of this game, I feel it right to do a review of the original classic that hit two consoles more than ten years ago.  This review will primarily cover the Nintendo Gamecube version, though I may do a review for the Wii version in the future.  This will be a fairly lengthy and in-depth review, so be warned.  With all of that to say, enjoy the following review for what is a magnificent game indeed.

The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is a game that was hyped and talked about beyond belief back before it hit the home consoles in 2006.  See, when the GameCube was originally announced, fans expected there to be a ""gritty"" Zelda title in the vein of Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask.  Instead, Nintendo released a game called ""The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"" for the beloved purple lunch box.  We all know the story of that by now.  Fans were baffled and outraged, but as soon is we played ""The Wind Waker,"" we realized what an awesome game it was.  Still, there were still fans clamoring for a Zelda game in the style of the N64 classics.  As this was around the same time that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was taking the world by storm, demand for a dark and gritty fantasy setting for Zelda was even more desired.  Nintendo answered their fans, and, in 2004, Shigeru Miyamoto himself walked onto the stage at E3 to announce the next Legend of Zelda game for the Nintendo GameCube.  The trailer showcased Link riding Epona, engaging in intense, gritty horseback combat.  There was even a boss that looked to be inspired by the Balrog from the Lord of the Rings.  The trailer featured thunderous applause.  We would have to wait two and a half more years before getting the game.  When it finally landed in 2006 on two consoles, it did not disappoint.  This was the Zelda game I felt like I had been waiting for since I first played Ocarina of Time.  While some in recent years simply feel the game is little more than a ""retelling"" of Ocarina of Time, I personally hardly see that as a bad thing, given that I love Ocarina so much in the first place.  I am happy to say that this is one of the very best games of its era, and one of the best games, now, for three consecutive Nintendo consoles (Read my review of the Wii U version if you feel so inclined.)  Without further ado, Let's get into the review of this awesome game.

Story:  Like most Zelda games. this title opens up with Link living in a small village, and leading a simple life.  What is different about this game is that Link really feels like a full-fledged character, instead of just an avatar.  Link has a life, and friends.  At the start of the game, Link is a ranch hand, and he spends his days herding goats with his boss, Fado.  Link is also quite athletic in this version of Zelda, as he is able to wrestle with goats, leap fences on his horse, and even has some experience sumo wrestling.

One day, Link is told by the Mayor of Ordon Village, and his cousin, Rusl, that he must go take a ceremonial gift to Hyrule Castle, just in time for Princess Zelda's coronation.  On the day that Link is to leave, the forces of evil that had already taken over the kingdom of Hyrule make their way to Link's village.  A sinister group of goblins riding on the backs of boars, headed by king bulbil, kidnap Link's friends Ilia (daughter of the Mayor,) Colin, and the other village kids.  Link chases after his friends, only to find himself in front of a black wall.  A hand reaches out, grabs Link, and pulls him into the twilight Realm.  Link then turns into a wolf (a key gameplay and story mechanic in this game.)  It is after this that Link is taken to a mysterious dungeon, where he is held prisoner.  After waking up, a mysterious imp by the name of Midna makes her acquaintance with the Hylian-turned-beast.  Link and Midna escape from the dungeon, and go to the tower where Princess Zelda herself is being held captive.

 Zelda tells Link of the fate of Hyrule being covered in the dark foggy mist known as twilight, and the king of shadows who laid siege to the kingdom.  This dark king is known as Zant, and he seeks to engulf the entire world of light in shadow.  Link and Midna then head back to Faron woods, where Link rescues the light spirit.  After being transformed back into a human, Link and Midna are instructed to go to the Forest Temple to retrieve the fused shadow, the weapon that can defeat Zant.  Link and Midna then set forth into the land of Hyrule to regain the three shadow pieces, save Link's friends, and free the kingdom of Hyrule from despair and destruction.  There are plenty of exciting twists and turns along thw way, but for spoilers sake, I will keep the story descriptions short.  Needless to say, the story is one of the deepest that the Zelda series has ever known.  Midna herself is hands-down the best sidekick in Zelda history, and is an awesome character in her own right.  While there are some plot holes here and there, the story still does a wonderful job of setting the mood for this darker, more grim tale in the Zelda mythos.

Design:  Twilight Princess is a game that strived for a more gritty and dark look than previous Zelda games had done.  To that end, it had a more saturated color pallete, and lots more emphasis on art direction and boss design.  I for one thing that the visuals in this game are beautiful.  Next to Resident Evil 4, I can't think of many other games on the GameCube that reached this level of technical achievement.  The lighting effects were phenomenal, and the water itself continues to impress me and make me wonder how they managed to achieve this kind of effect on the Gamecube.  The character models are well-proportioned and perfectly encapsulate the more realistic feel of the game.  There is even some cel-shading elements (particularly in the twilight realm.)  One thing that hasn't aged as well visually, are the textures.  They were heavily cleaned up in the Wii U re-release, but they often look indistinguishable, blurry, and buddy at times.  This is one element of the more gritty and realistic look that does not stand up as well as something like ""Wind Waker's"" more cartoonish style.

The art direction deserves notable mention.  While the game looks fine from a technical standpoint for the most part, it is the art direction that really makes this game shine.  The enemy designs, the Twilight Realm and its particle effects, the whole game is one of the most awe-inspiring looking games I have yet seen from Nintendo.  The whole look of the game feels evocative of a graphic novel.  Everything from Link and Zelda, to Midna and Zant, to the bosses and mini bosses, even the aesthetics of the dungeons themselves are some of the most visually appealing things I have yet seen in a Zelda game to this day.  Moreover, while the game has a more realistic and gritty look than other Zelda games, it still has the whimsical vibe in its visuals that helps to retain the fun, charming nature that Zelda has always had.  This includes the sillier, more zany characters and locations to contrasts well with the rest of the game's look.

The sound design in this game is good, but not up to par with other Zelda installments.  Most of the songs in this game are from Zelda game's Prior, like ""A Link to the Past,"" ""Ocarina of Time,"" and so on.  Don't get me wrong, the songs still sound great, and I love hearing remixed versions of my old favorite Zelda songs.  The newer songs in this game aren't nearly as memorable, with a few exceptions.  These exceptions are Midna's theme, and the Hyrule Field theme.  Both of these songs rank among my favorite musical pieces in Zelda history.  The biggest disappointment in the sound area is the lack of orchestration.  It would have been killer to have a full-fledged orchestra conduct the game, you'll have to wait for ""Skyward Sword"" for that.  The sound effects themselves are pretty good, however, like the sound of Link's sword, or Epona's galloping.

The menu system is much improved over previous Zelda installments.  It feels far more streamlined, it's fast to use, and it doesn't slow the pace of the game.  The downside to the GameCube version is that you can only have two secondary items equipped at a time, since the Z button is sued to call Midna, or turn into a wolf.  The other issue with the design occurs whenever you pick up a blue or red rupee.  Every time you boot up the game, and you collect one of these rupees, the game you pause to give you a description of them again.  This is annoying, and prior Zelda game's didn't have this issue.  Luckily, the Wii U version fixed this.

All in all, Twilight Princess is a beautiful, detailed, and meticulously crafted game.  While it has some issues, the overall design outshines those issues.

Controls and Gameplay:
The Control Scheme for Twilight Princess is so good that you could bounce an orange rupee off of it and get extra currency.  The controls take the foundations established in prior 3D Zelda installments, but build upon them tooth and nail.  Moving Link with the control stick is straightforward and simple, as is swinging Link's sword with B.  You press L to target and enemy during combat.  While fighting, you can use both your basic sword and shield moves, or any number of hidden skills (more on that later.)  Some enemies also require you to use your projectile weapons, which you may also use while targeted onto an enemy.  You use the x,y, and Z buttons for your secondary items such as your bow, claw-shots, ball and chain (awesome) and the like.  Link jumps automatically when he comes to a ledge.  Controlling Epona is also very straightforward.  Now, the controls for Link in his wolf form are mapped to the same buttons as they are in human form.  Wolf Link basically has equivalent attacks in his canine form that match the same moves he has as a human.  The climbing controls can feel a little stiff by todays standards, but they are far from broken.  Other than that, the controls are essentially flawless, and hold up gracefully and beautifully.

Being a Zelda game, and a Triple A Nintendo title, Twilight Princess features some of the finest Gameplay that the gaming industry has to offer, period.  The combat quality itself is absolutely superb.  You'd be hard pressed to find another 3-D Sword fighting hack-n-slash action game that handles its combat even half as well as it is handled in Twilight Princess.  You fight all kinds of enemies, from man-eating plants, to spiders to sword wielding goblins, to skeletons, lizard men, and armored knights.  As Wolf Link, you also fight a multitude of Twilight beings, specifically beings known as ""shadow beasts.""  Throughout the game, you happen upon an ancient, deceased warrior known as the Heroes Shade.  The Shade teaches Link no less than seven sword moves.  As you fight more and more enemies, you find new and faster ways to fight and dispatch of them; these moves include back-slicing, shield-parries, an instant-kill mortal draw, and so many more.  You even gain the mega-spin attack near the very end of the game.  Now, I may be in the minority, but I actually really like wolf Link.  Wolf Link has some awesome moves and attacks in his own right.  With Midna's assistant, Wolf Link can build up a ring of energy, and take out multiple enemies at once.  Wolf Link is also far more agile and nimble than normal Link.  Not only can he run faster, but he also has the ability to move normally even in places where regular Link would get stuck do to his weight (such as the Snowpeak mountain.)  Wolf Link also has heightened sense of smell, and can even jump to far-to-reach places with Midna's assistance.  While the combat is fairly easy, most enemies will fall easily to you and your blade, it is so darn refined and fun that you often feel like you can look past the difficulty, or relative lack thereof.

The meat and potatoes of any Zelda game and its gameplay is its dungeons design, and Twilight Princess has some of the best dungeons this side of the bridge of Hylia.  each dungeon in the game is magnificently crafted that it could have served as a full fledged game mechanic.  From using your boomerang to clear a cluster of leaves and save the monkeys of the forest temple, to walking upside down with a pair of magnetic iron boots. or using your claw-shot, and later, double clawshots, to swing from wall to wall, or ceiling to ceiling, each dungeon is a wonderful and joyous treat to play-through.  Every dungeon feels like it gets better than the last.  Later on in the game, you find yourself in the Arbiter's Grounds, where you must make your way through what feels like a sandy grave, in order to find a contraption that allows Link to spin along walls (the spinner) and partake in what feels like a virtual pinball game.

The Snowpeak ruins might be my favorite 3D Zelda dungeon.  The ice themed locales, the unique enemy designs, and the whole theme of the dungeon set it apart from just about any other Zelda dungeon that I have played.  Moreover, it has an awesome mini boss, and boss.  The Snow-peak ruins features my favorite new addition to the Zelda series in this game, the ball and chain.  While it is super heavy, Link uses the ball and chain to smash ice, frozen blocks, and even take out enemies.  Moreover, there are whole puzzles designed around this simple premise of smashing ice blocks in this dungeon.  The Temple of Time is also one of the game's best dungeons.  Not only does it feature the wicked awesome mini-boss, the ""dark nut,"" but it also introduces yet another awesome puzzle solving mechanic.  The item you obtain in the dungeon, the dominion rod, allows you to control certain statues, and guide them from one spot to another.  Once again, this is a simple premise that none the less has some surprisingly complex puzzles built around it.

While each of the items is awesome in its own right, the trade-off to having such great dungeon design is that every items feels specifically built for that particular dungeon.  There are a few mainstay items that you will use throughout the game, such as the bow, but many of the items will sit in Link's inventory for the majority of the game after he has completed a given dungeon, and start to collect dust.  There are secret grottos and shrines in the over-world that will require you to use these items again in order to get a prize, such as a piece of heart, but all in all, they will see little use outside of the dungeons you found them in.

Twilight Princess features plenty of variety to its gameplay.  Beyond simply concurring dungeons, you will partake in epic and awesome horseback battles, meet many unique and interesting personalities, and even sumo wrestle with the Gorons of Death Mountain.  You rarely feel like you're doing the same thing for more than an hour.  You can even race a Yeti down a mountain on a frozen leaf!  Later on in the game, you can even participate in what feels like a wild-west inspired bow and arrow shoot-out.  There is more variety to the gameplay here than you can shake the Master sword at.

The boss battles are big, epic, and fun.  The boss designs rank among the very best in the Zelda series.  You'll fight man eating plants, fiery beasts with flaming chains, a giant Yeti stuck in an icicle, and even a Dragon.  One of the bosses, Stallord, even requires you to use your spinner in a manner reminiscent of a pinball game.  every boss feels unique and different from the last, and often put the bosses of prior Zelda games to shame.  Now, you will also occasionally fight bosses outside of dungeons, though they only occur a few times in the game.  These bosses include a jousting sequence with the Bulblin king on the bridge of Eldin, as well as a giant twilight bug that you must take apart as wolf Link in Lake Hylia.  One disappointing thin about the bosses is that they are way too easy.  Most of them will fall to your blade after just a few rounds.  This game also doesn't feature a heroes mode either, so there isn't really a difficulty option (this was also changed in the Wii U version, thankfully.)  Even with all that to say, the boss battles are still intense and epic.  They will surely leave a lasting impression.  The final boss (spoiler) is awesome, and features the one-to-one sword-fight I felt like I always wanted before this game came out.

The Gameplay in twilight Princess, regardless of what angle you look at it from, is refined and perfected with the utmost care.  This isn't a short walk in the park either, you will have at least 35-45 hours of gameplay before you finish your first play-through, which isn't even getting into the side-quests.

Replay-ability:  Twilight Princess is a big game.  The over-world map is rivaled only by Wind Waker in its scale.  While riding around on Epona is epic and a lot of fun, much of the over-world feels admittedly empty.  There are plenty of things to do, but they feel very spread out.  Even with that to say, there is still plenty of option things and objectives that will keep you coming back to this game for weeks.  You can help a selfish man named Jovani recover his soul by tracking down sixty Poe souls in Hyrule (this game's take on the Skulltula hunt if you will,) you can help a weird girl named Agitha find her dreams of being the insect princess by finding several small insects around
Hyrule, you can also get every piece of heart.

The game also features many item upgrades, such as a larger quiver, extra bomb bags, and larger wallets so that Link can carry more money than he could originally.  You get these by playing certain mini games (there is a super fun claw-shot mini-game that you play to get a larger quiver,) helping some of the residents of castle Town or Kakariko village, and even fishing.  The fishing mini-game is addictive, and will keep you coming back in and of itself.  You can even ride downstream Zora's river in a Canoe, as you shoot jars to score points.  You can also help the creepy baby, Malo, with his business venture, and open up a (slightly) less overpriced goods shop in Castle town.

While some of the side quests at are less useful than others (such as the magic armor, which does little purpose) they're still really fun and give this game lots of replay value.  There is even an optional gauntlet that you can partake in, wherein you must clear fifty floors of enemies that you have thought throughout the course of your journey.  Since this game is so much fun, you won't want it to end right away.  For that reason, I would honestly recommend that you do at least one completionist run of this game.

Verdict:  I have no shame in saying that I consider ""The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess"" one of the very finest games in the Zelda series, and one of the best games out there, period. I myself rank this game in my top three Zelda games.  Each time I go back and replay this game, I remember what a wonderful experience it was, and still is to play through.  While the game might not be without its flaws, it doesn't change the fact that at the end pf the day, I can't think of this game as anything less than a Masterpiece.
if you own a GameCube, a Wii, or a Wii U, then this game is a must own experience.  I realize that this has been a long review, and that I have been very positive about this game, but I do feel like this game warrants lengthy review, and is deserving of such praise.  This is an epic, beautiful, and most importantly, insanely fun adventure that you will remember for a long time.  So play this game, match the power of the king of shadows, and restore the land of Hyrule to its former state.  And, remember,

The graphics are great in the game, and the system for hitting and pitching is awsome.  When hitting, you are shown the hot and cold zones for your hitter.  You use the left analog controller to decide what direction to try to hit to.  When pitching, you actually are the pitcher, not the catcher.  Before you throw each pitch, you locate it, then ther is a bar where you have to stop it in the red zone (you'll understand what I'm saying when you see).  The game also has a franchise mode that's pretyy entertaining.  There are a few glitches like when you throw the ball to someone near a base to try to tag that person out, they sometimes move very akwardly and take several seconds to get there which is too late or when they try to tag the person out, they misposition themselves and completly miss and easy tag.

White,"From watching what new fish-type would emerge when I cross-bred two unlike types, to discovering and then breeding for specific, really expensive breeds to sell, this game was fun and interesting. Though probably not for those who like fast-paced action, for someone with only a few minutes to spare here and there, this game can be very enjoyable. As a plus, you can use your favorite aquarium as a screen saver, if you choose.

I wound up making cross-breeding charts in my quest for the most expensive fish as well as the seven magic fish, since the puzzle of which breeds when crossed produced what new fish-type could get rather complicated, and followed only the game's unique brand of logic. It was also interesting to discover the maximum price I could charge for each fish and still have them sell quickly, to bring in the money I needed to buy those important upgrades. There are so many different types of fish, I found that, in my quest to discover the seven magic fish (and even with the maximum of three aquariums), overcrowding occurred rather quickly, so pricing to sell was critical.

In my analysis, this game is best for older teens through adults, as younger children could get discouraged rather quickly if they forget to feed their fish and don't pause the game, then come back to it only to find dead fish everywhere. I realized this from my 6 year old grandson playing another Big Fish real-time game, Virtual Villagers. I asked him if he was enjoying the game and he said, ""No. I don't like it. All I got is little dead people everywhere!"" To my credit, I didn't laugh out loud.",I really loved playing this game!,1269907200,3,,

I played Witcher 2 on the following system with no problem: P4 3.0 gig CPU (HT on) 4 gigs RAM, HIS HD-4670 with 1 gig RAM. So I sort expected the game's specs to be a bit high and more than likely a bit too high. I first cranked this game up with the following specs: i5 3.2 (3.4 turbo) gigs, 16 gigs RAM, NVidia GT-730 card) Game ran fine but sluggish. Come to find out all the game's graphic options were ""maxed out"". Well, not everyone believes in high screen resolution games. I play most all mine on the default res of my monitor (1366x768@60Hz.) and I'm fine with that. I noted that even at that setting the graphic didn't seem that much better than Witcher 2. It seems someone fell into the old trap that higher settings mean a better looking game. That's not necessarily true. Some of the best games I've seen didn't have the greatest graphics set up but still were a joy to play. At present I'm running this game on the following card as I just updated my video card to one that will meet my needs better: NVidia GTX-750 Ti SC 2 gigs GDDR5 RAM. The game runs very well on this but I may have to adjust the settings a bit to get a balance between good looks and performance. This is what I feel is needed. If it's sluggish in game play, then the settings need some attention to even that out. If a game runs great maxed out then fine, if not then find the happy medium and you will have, from my point of view, a much better gaming experience.

5.0,True,"04 28, 2011",A18S0KCHWYEI20,B00002EPZ2,VG Fan,"Planescape Torment is a cult classic and is considered by many to have the best story in any video game ever made.  I recently completed it, and I'm here to tell you that the hype is justified--this is an incredible game.  It instantly makes it into my all time top 5.  Planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot I have ever seen in a video game.  It's possible there are some adventure games that can hold a candle to it (I've heard the story in the game The Longest Journey is mind blowing), but I haven't played them.

 In terms of gameplay, this game is similar to the Baldur's Gate series, although it does have a few enhancements to the engine such as the ability to queue up multiple actions.  The combat here is not quite as tight as found in Baldur's Gate, but it gets the job done just fine.  This game is more focused on dialogue than combat, so if you like a very combat heavy game then you might not like it quite as much.  That said, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone who enjoys video games and a good story not enjoying this game.  You should also not get the idea that this is just a point and click adventure game with no real combat.  There is still plenty of combat, and you must do some heavy fighting to get through a number of sequences in the game.

Although there isn't a ton of it, the voice acting is another major strong point in this game that I wanted to mention.  Another thing I like is that you level up A LOT in this game.  You start out as sort of weak, but by the end of the game you are a bad, bad man, and that's something I always like in my RPGs.

 Graphically, this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution, but this doesn't matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen.  Using the mod, it looks fantastic in widescreen.  The artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovely--it made me long for the days of 2d graphics to be honest.  I found full on widescreen at 1280 x 800 to be too zoomed out, so I made a custom resolution for 960 x 600 and found that to be just about right.  In fact, there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google.  Most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new material.

 A gameplay tip I would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements.  I am not sure how much is necessary to get everything, but just thought I'd pass that along.  I created a mage and had them both very, very high.",Amazing Game,1303948800,13,,

The Bad: Units take forever to build, too simple for some, no extras, no huge changes over the first game

RTS games of old were just all about buildings units and killing the enemy, and thankfully StarCraft II keeps this in mind, and let's RTS fans of the 90's get another taste. Liberty has you playing as James Raynor who is an outlaw to the Dominion Republic, and must stop the alien Zerg, the Dominion forces, the Queen of Blades (Sarah Kerrigan), and the Protoss all at once. The story is pretty riveting especially for an RTS thanks to excellent voice acting, dialog, and plot twists.

I'm not going to explain how an RTS is played, and if you played the original game you know what you're getting here. The game is very simple with the premise of just building you army and completing objectives. There are only two resources in the game: Vespian gas and minerals. Don't like it then go back to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War (I'm not saying those are bad games). You gather these with SCVs, and you build you main buildings such as factories, starports, barracks, and anything that other units require and have at it. Yes it's that simple, but there are many changes and enhancements from the first game.

Firstly there are a ton of different units, and you really have to think and strategize how to beat each mission. Each building has several units, but the game focuses on air and ground units. There are weaker units such as marines, reapers, and firebats, but then maruaders are the strongest. The factory holds goliaths, different vehicle units or the strongest one being a Thor which is a giant mech. The starport has several different types of ship units with the biggest being the battle cruiser.

There are also defensive units that SCVs can build such as missile turrets, detectors, and mind control units for the Zerg. There are so many units you have something for every situation and you end up using every single one quite often since they are perfectly balanced. Some units have special attacks that do extra damage, but use up the units' energy supply. Some units can transform from ground to air, or turn into defensive units. There is so much when it comes to this that it would take forever to describe them all.

The missions are great and varied and you will never get bored. They offer a fair challenge and even the later missions were fairly balanced. The game is just full of so much variety, but it's so simple and easy to play and understand that is really pulls you in. Throughout the 26 missions you will slowly earn more units to build, and be able to build larger stronger armies. The literal goal is to just build dozens upon hundreds of units and attack or defend, and complete the objectives.

The game's only real flaw is that building units takes forever, but this also balances the game out so you really think on what units you need and use them wisely. There are small band-aids for this such as the mercenary compound. You can instantly call down highly skilled units for a large price, but there's cool down time. You can also build multiple buildings or build a different lab to build two units simultaneously, but you can't build more advanced units without the tech lab.

You can upgrade most units with credits earned during missions, but you won't ever be able to by them all so choose wisely. You can also use research points to pick one of two upgrades on a ladder. One side helps your army and the other is research against the Zerg. Choose wisely since you can't pick the other or go back. This upgrading system is great and adds lots of strategy even off the battlefield.

Aside from all this you can click around and listen to dialog from key characters, and this adds to the story and interactivity of the game which is excellent. There are no extras, however, such as behind the scenes footage or anything which would have been great. The game just has so much variety and content, and is so perfectly balanced it really feels those 12 years were put to good use.

The multi player is what will keep you coming back. I'm not a huge fan of RTS multi player, but Liberty really shines in this area with Battle.net. With the human opponents and four different factions to play as you will surely pour dozens of hours into this part of the game.

The game also looks amazing. If you have the rig to play the game with all settings to their highest you will be treated with beautiful visuals, excellent lighting, and well done animations and effects. Everything looks amazing, and the game just plays brilliantly. I highly recommend this for StarCraft vets, but people who like their RTS complicated and with a lot of depth will be disappointed, but there is something here for everyone.",An amazing sequel to one of the best PC games ever made,1332892800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have put in about 100 hours, and I can tell you that every second of it was pure fun. Except for the second secret boss, which I won't say anything about just in case you don't want me to spoil anything. But that boss is extremely unfair and took me over 60 tries to beat him with just Terra, who by the way is extremely slow and is the hardest to beat this boss with. Well that's the only bad thing about the game, unless you hate board games like me. There are tons of minigames, like the frustrating fruit ball, the rumble racing, the repetitive command board, and the ice cream beat. But if you're like me, you will already have gotten 100% in the mini-games category if you are a 100% completionist. Besides the mini-games, there is the story mode, which although Tetsuya Nomura said would be 15 hours for each character, it is a lot less. Don't let him deceive you. I took my time with each one and managed to beat each one in just under 7 hours (all on standard difficulty). So it's around 20 hours total for just the story mode, plus the final episode which is 10 minutes of cutscenes, 2 boss fights, and then another 10 minutes of cutscenes. But the story mode itself is fun to play through. After the story mode and the mini-games, we have all the command-melding, the ice cream shop, and all of the item collection itself like keyblades and other stuff. And then there's a unique world called the Mirage Arena. This is personally my favorite world because it has 13 arenas you can fight your way through. But yeah the whole game is 95% fun except the minigames like fruitball and command board, and then that second secret boss. But it's worth it to shell out $40 for a game you'll be playing for over 100 hours. If you're going to just play through the story then let the game gather dust, you should probably buy it as well because it's just amazing overall.

The Diabolical Box is like Curious Village but so much better.

* This game lasts so much longer that Curious Village, keeps you captivated longer and offers a lot more challenges. Without doing any of the ""Bonus"" games, this was twice the play time as Curious Village.

* The graphics are just as good if not a little better. There are cutaways of movie-like scenes as well as the traditional dialogue scenes, some with voice overs, some without.

* The puzzles offer a variety of simple to very challenging. There is a terrific selection of puzzle styles, sure to please all ages.

* Hint coins are still readily available with the option of buying up to three hints per puzzle.

* Puzzles are everywhere and seem to be just the right mix of puzzle to story/dialogue ratio.

* There is a huge improvement to the puzzles with the addition of a MEMO mode. Memo mode allows you to see the puzzle (slightly faded back) and have a scratch pad to make notes or work through the puzzles. This mode holds your notes as you go back and forth from the puzzle to memo again so your notes stay intact.

* The storyline is much more enjoyable and the scenery changes often enough (multiple villages, trains, etc.) so you are not traveling back and forth to the same spots over and over.

* The introduction of puzzles into the dialogue is a little more natural whereas in Curious Village when you needed to do a puzzle, the character intros to give you the puzzle were much more forced.

* The mini games include exercising a hamster (amusing), rebuilding a camera (interesting), brewing tea with different ingredients, as well as the old trunk standbys of a journal, mysteries list, and puzzle index. There is also a 'locked' diary.

* The music is fine and doesn't seem to get annoying but the fake English accents are still pretty bad.

* The story ends and after credits, allows you to go back to a previous scene to finish playing any puzzles you may have missed.

* There is a bonus section that you can get into when starting the game that includes the ""Weekly download Puzzle"", the puzzle index (the same as in the Professor's Trunk), Layton's Challenges which include some more difficult puzzles that progressively unlock the more you complete. There is also the Top Secret section including character profiles, art, music, and additional sections that unlock with clues found in the game.

The only problem I have with a couple of the puzzles is that they are based on noticing details in ""photos"" and looking at them on a DS screen is difficult since the resolution isn't so hot.

Microsoft wants to charge you $20-$30 for their ""Official"" one, which is a little ridiculous, and the charge and play cable won't work for using a wireless controller with a PC.  So when I found this one, I did a little research on it, and read the reviews, good and bad, to get an idea of its quality.  I read a lot of reviews that said that they couldn't get the receiver to work because there was no driver for it, but then there were a lot that said it would work with the Microsoft drivers.  So I took a chance on it, heck it was less than 10 bucks so I wouldn't be out very much if it didn't work, and went ahead and ordered one to try out.  When I received it, it was just like any other product from China, it was in a plain white box with a product sticker on it.  Inside the box was the receiver and a small piece of paper with some very poorly written instructions in English.  I plugged it in to the USB port on my computer to test it out, and at first it wouldn't register.  So I plugged it into a different port, the first one was a USB 3.0 which are finicky by nature sometimes, and it popped up in the notifications try saying that it was searching for the drivers for the newly found device.  After about a minute or so, it said it was complete.  I opened up the Device Manager, and found the device in the peripherals section, which said it was a Microsoft USB Controller Receiver.  I opened up the info for it to see what driver it used, and sure enough it installed the standard Microsoft XBox 360 Wireless Controller driver.  I then loaded up Skyrim to see if it actually would function with my wireless controller.  Once the game loaded, I pressed the sync button on the controller and the receiver to get them to connect to each other and once they did, I was able to use the controller to play Skyrim just like I have been with my wired controller.  I was very pleased with the results, so I am actually going to buy another one for my computer.

My review of the original Dark Souls was a ranting, sprawling mess so I'm going to try to keep this one as short as possible.  This is an extremely impressive addition to the already incredible Souls series.  When Dark Souls II was initially announced to be in development there were a lot of concerns that the game would be dumbed down and less difficult.  These fears were only further enhanced when it was announced that the original director of the Souls games, Hidetaka Miyazaki, would be stepping down.  I am pleased to say that this is not the case at all.  In fact, if anything this game may be harder than the original Dark Souls at some points.  Some of the bosses are downright brutal and the enemy AI has been improved significantly.  The combat also seems much weightier but all and all this game plays and feels just like its predecessor.  It still has the wonderful level design, dark and brooding atmosphere, sense of exploration, and fantastic enemy placement that its predecessors had.  When I started playing this game my experience with the original Dark Souls (and Demons Souls) made me believe that I would be able to catch on really quickly.  Boy did Dark Souls II shove my hubris down my throat.  While I beat the original countless times I felt like I had to relearn everything again when I started playing this game.  Shielding takes longer, the timing for parrying is different, the enemies recover quicker, etc.  Essentially the way I played Dark Souls was useless to me here.  So while this game does feel and play a lot like the previous Souls games it also doesn't ride its predecessors success at all and has quite a few gameplay quirks and a ton of new creative difficulty to give you that suffering that hurts so good.  My only complaint is that a couple of the bosses feel like they were ripped them out of the last game.  Hell one of the bosses is a straight copy of one of the bosses from the original Dark Souls (I'M LOOKING AT YOU BLUE CATHEDRAL!).  I would've loved to see purely original bosses but it is a very minor complaint from me and overall this is a truly fantastic game that has completely captivated me like few games can.  I highly recommend it and I honestly believe that the Souls series is now the best current franchise in video games at least amongst RPGs.  Seriously if you love a challenge and/or enjoyed what the other games had to offer, BUY THIS GAME!!! NOW! Oops I said I was gonna make this short.  I guess I failed again haha!

Update:  I recently beat the game again (with a new character) and subsequently played through the original Dark Souls again.  Comparing the two I have to admit that while dark souls II is a very challenging game and is a joy to play the original is still a superior game in most aspects and is the more difficult of the two.  Don't get me wrong, I love them both but the original has better atmosphere, more difficult bosses, and more creative enemy and level design.  I have to admit that when I first reviewed Dark Souls II it had been awhile since I played the original and I kinda forgot how much of a masterpiece it is.

Just play it for yourself, and see what everyone is talking about. I can't wait to discover all the alternate endings. I would say it's relatively easy in comparison to FFIV, but it's definitely got some harder parts if you don't plan accordingly and are to low of level, but nothing that you can't overcome, and after all is said and done, you'll feel attached to these little sprites on the screen. My favorite would have to be Ayla, and Lucca.

Graphics - I'm glad they didn't give this one the 3d facelift, I think the most charming thing about this game is it's art design, and presentation.

Gameplay - Combat here is so much fun, the variations and all the techs and combinations really take the atb system to a whole new level, and they should implement this style into more rpgs. I never used the stylus, and that worked perfectly for me.

Sound - Definitely one of the best scores for a game I've ever heard, I uploaded the OST on my iPod and listen to it all the time. Favorite tracks would have to be Castle Gaurdia, Frogs Theme, and of course the main Melody.

Story - Somewhat linear yet, intricately laced, with many many layers, there is alot more that meets the eye here people.

spyro is a good choice for magic skylanders he has a bash attack and he shoots fireballs. he can fly too. you don't need dark spyro. just an overpriced paint job. regular spyro is good enough.

now. trigger happy.
trigger happy was an awesome choice for a tech skylander. i love his gun attacks. they get even better when you upgrade him.  next to drobot. trigger happy is my favorite tech skylander.

gill grunt is last.
the water skylander gill grunt. not much to say. he can swim. which is very useful. he gets better with upgrading. (chose the harpoon path >_<)

Now, any veteran of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo classic Mario games will feel that this game is at a much slower pace.  While there is plenty of jump and run action, this game has many RPG elements--lots of story, items, story, puzzles, oh and story.  The story itself is very strange, but if you stop to read it (instead of skipping to the action), it's actually quite amusing.  Also, you'll run into levels that leave you scratching your head until you remember to flip the world somewhere or wave the remote at some wall to find the way forward.  Though, this is not so bad in my opinion, because you get to play the game longer.

So, Super Paper Mario may feel somewhat like the classic Mario gameplay, but it has so much more added to it wrapped up in a funny story.  Definitely a must-own game for Mario fans who have managed to snap up a Wii.",Old School meets New School,1176422400,3,,

5.0,False,"01 14, 2010",A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B001YI0Z2U,Terrence A.,"I'd say that the level of chaos in this game is unlike anything I've ever seen before. There were more than a few moments where I was mashing buttons, hoping against hope that somewhere in the maelstrom of bullets, blades, explosions, geysers of blood and spiked heels made of hair, I was making some kind of progress. Still, Bayonetta goes down in my book of playing history as one of the most original, challenging and awe inspiring games I have ever played.

Bayonetta is an Umbran witch with a gun in each hand and one on each foot. You will shoot plenty of bullets with these guns as you take on the hordes of angels you must destroy on your quest. She also has claws, katanas and shotguns for you to use. Keep the kiddies away from this one because this chick has a penchant for getting as naked as you can without showing the goods. Her outfit is made up of her long hair which is also used to summon demons. Don't ask as it just makes more sense while you play.

This is a game that you cannot take seriously because the moment you do, you'll lose any enjoyment intended for you by the developers. It's very tongue-in-cheek and has a heroine that wags her butt and crotch in your face at any opportunity available. In this universe populated with witches who look like they've walked out of a leather fetishist convention, bird-like angels, flying motorcycles, gun heeled boots with infinite ammo, demons made out of flowing hair, doe eyed children and bosses that look like something out of an evangelist's nightmares, this game begs not to be taken seriously. The story makes barely a lick of sense and is as all over the place as the action. Still, its hilarious at times and benefits from a kooky mix of Japanese/ French new wave humor.

The graphics really shine and everything just looks great. The frame rate is a solid 60 frames per second and runs very smoothly. The character design is top tier and are well realized as each character looks just like they should. The boss battles are spectacular and probably the best thing about the whole package. Each one trumps the last and the final battle is one for the books. I was literally sitting there with my jaw on the floor watching this amazing feat in gameplay design as I fought with everything I had. Seriously, the overall design of the bosses as well as the general artistic design of the game is beautiful and flawless. The game feels extremely polished and is very intuitive, even as you're feeling like you don't know what the hell is going on.

The music in this game is probably one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a videogame and that's not by any stretch of the imagination. The soundtrack was released as a 5-CD set in Japan and frankly, after hearing it in the game, I would definitely pick it up. Bayonetta's main theme reminds me a lot of the retro stylings of Space Channel 5's music while the rest of the music sounds equal parts jazzy, orchestral and choral.

There are complaints to be made. The game may be just a little too hardcore for its own good and as much fun as it can be to jump headfirst into the complete craziness of it all, it can be a little cheap at times and coupled with a camera that isn't necessarily on your side every given moment, it can get a bit frustrating when you're dying multiple times at the same point.

It's violent, it's brash, it's groovy and it's sexy in the most retarded of ways. This game is a triumph and one that may be a little too ahead of its time. I think a lot of people are not going to know what to make of this game and will unwisely pass on it. I think those with an open mind and who are willing to see what this game has to offer will be richly rewarded. If you liked mayhem rich games like Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry (which was also developed by the same guy as Bayonetta), then you'll appreciate this. You'd have to.

One last note. I beat this game on Normal difficulty, which was pretty challenging. I went immediately to Hard and it was like walking into a dog pound wearing a suit made of steaks. Make no mistake, this is one game that will thrash you senselessly and keep you coming back for more.

There are all sorts of pros to the game, but only a few cons...and the cons barely matter!

Pros:
-An incredible story.
-Deep and engaging play.
-Beautiful battle graphics and CG cinemas.
-Plenty of subquests.
-VERRRRY lengthy!
-Unique characters.
-Hollywood-worthy music.
-Plenty of plot-twists.

Cons (there are few):
-Sometimes a bit tedious
-Battle system is a bit flawed.
-Terrible land animation.
-If you devote your life to gaming, you may have to say goodbye to your family and friends.

The bottom line: this is an altogether gaming masterpiece spanning three discs of epic conflict, timeless romance, and magical battles. If your forte in gaming is roleplaying in general or the Final Fantasy series, then I highly recommend this game!

I finally gave in and from the moment I picked up the controller I couldn't stop.  I found myself playing this game until 4 o clock in the morning at one point because I was so hooked I lost track of time.  I first played Dragon Age which was made by the same teams and even though I loved that game, I feel that this one is ten times better!

The character design is excellent.  I love the characters and their back story, even though I didn't play the first Mass Effect (cuz I have PS3 not xbox), I really felt connected to them either way without having had opportunity to know a few of them from the prior game.  The graphics are well done (even if at some points they look eh) I felt the general design was good and amazing to look at.  The story is awesome and it's very hard to quickly explain what i liked about it.  One thing that really fascinated me was that you could either be a Paragon or Renegade (which is kind of like good guy or bad guy), this involves you making chooses that raise your status as either.  This factors into the end result of your game as well.

The way you can have the ending turn out is so unbelievable that I felt that this game was like playing a real life experience.  At the end you will either have members of your team die or they will all survive.  What goes into it is so complicated and interesting that I decided to just go about it without looking at tips until after.  Member loyalties, who you choose to take certain positions and do certain tasks develops that and you will end up with an ending that is different from mine or the next.  I ended up really sad because what I didn't want to happen happened either way, but it made me feel like I wasn't playing a game but watching a really well scripted movie.

The only things I didn't like that much were the upgrading system and the love interest choices.  What I mean by that is even though I play games I don't consider myself a master gamer and I felt like the upgrade system took some getting used to and at times I didn't even know what to upgrade or if I should spend money on things that may or may not be useful.  I also didn't like that you couldn't have a male Shepard have a romance with another male, but a female could have one with another female.  This only annoyed me a little bit because that's what made me really like Dragon Age, it's something you don't see in a lot of games.  With all that said I think the pros of this game outweighed the cons since A) you could have a male/male relationship in Mass Effect 3 and B) My problem with upgrading is my default not the makers.

So my suggestion is this - If you like a game that has a lot of action, drama, and unexpected outcomes this is the game for you.  I think anyone who liked Dragon Age or Infamous would like this game and hopefully whoever takes my suggestion will agree with me on how awesome of an experience this game provides.",Best console game I've ever played,1360540800,,,

I've played Pikmin 1 and 2 to the end, and can honestly say that Pikmin 3 is 10 times as great as the first two games combined! The instant I started playing I could tell that the controls were improved A LOT. The characters run around SO SMOOTHLY! It even makes Olimar and Louie's controls from Pikmin 2 seem clumsy. And the graphics are CRAZY AWESOME!!! (When you walk in the water it looks REAL!) The game mechanics are very similar to the original Pikmins, but it feels like an entirely new game. The environments, the music, just EVERYTHING gives you a better feeling-it feels...fun! You won't have to try to love this Pikmin game! Bingo Battle is a lot like Pikmin 2's battle mode, but with a bingo-y twist, making it surprisingly more fun and addictive. Story Mode seems really great so far (with a heck of a lot more story than Pikmin 1 and 2). And the boss battles are a very nice addition! And Mission Mode is PERFECTION!!! Nintendo really made this seem like ""the lame mode"" when advertising Pikmin 3, but it's quite the contrary. I might even go so far as to say it's better than story mode. There is optional co-op play as well. You can select from 3 different styles of missions: treasure-finding, enemy-hunting, and boss battles. Boss battles is really just what it sounds like, nothing too special, but the other mission styles are incredibly challenging and fun (Good luck getting all the gold medals...)! The Wii U Gamepad makes for a great map in every mode, but I must say I'm a little disappointed with the gamepad controls (I play with a Wii remote and nunchuk). I was also disappointed that the thing where you can press ""down"" on the d-pad and have all your Pikmin walk in a certain direction was removed, but it was totally worth the brand new ninja-like dodge roll! The new Pikmin are also amazing! I find both the winged and rock Pikmin a lot more creative than the purple and white ones (Winged Pikmin are the best things ever). Yeah, this game has a few little flaws, but they can easily be overlooked. I would definitely recommend Pikmin 3 to any Wii U owner, and it greatly surpasses New Super Mario Bros.

5.0,False,"04 25, 2016",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B0191J0RXA,Poisoned Blade,"What is a Souls Game and how does it compare to the others?  The Dark Souls games, and Bloodborne were created by a Japanese company called From Software.  The Souls series is an extremely challenging action RPG series set in a horror fantasy universe.  You have a small health bar and several hits from just about any enemy will kill you.  This forces you to learn the attack patterns of all of the enemies, use the environment to your advantage, and look for weaknesses in their defenses.  So, every encounter and boss fight in the game is like a puzzle.  You'll take hits and die a few times trying to figure out the enemies, but once you do, you'll take them down like a pro.  Playing Dark Souls is both a punishing and rewarding experience, that you won't find anywhere else.

Dark Souls 3 plays very much like the previous Souls games, and less like Bloodborne.  The ramp up seems better in DS3.  The beginning levels are pretty easy and youll get a few hundred souls.  The later levels are much more difficult, but running through an area could get you 50,000 souls.

Story
You play as an undead and the adventure begins with you rising from your grave.  The eternal fires are burning out, and a champion known as the Ashen One must rekindle the fires to begin a new cycle of fire.  To do so, you must defeat five legendary heroes from the past to find and defeat the Soul of Cinder.  There are 4 possible endings to the game, so your choices in a few specific places matter.

In the Souls series, the stories are VERY UNDERSTATED.  There are some NPC's and they will provide you with important information.  But you'll have to remember everything they say and even look at descriptions of the items that you find.  If you look closely, you'll uncover the story arcs of the NPC's.

Dark Souls 3s story is a bit more focused than the other Souls games, but it is still VERY light.  Youll meet some NPCs and theyll join you.  Some live, some die, depending on what you do.  Out of the series, I think Bloodborne had the most understandable storylines and NPCs.

Gameplay
You create a character, level up to become stronger, and explore levels.  There will be traps, and about 100 different enemy types to stop you.  Killing an enemy will give you souls, or you can find souls in the levels.  Souls act as XP and Money.  If you die, you drop your souls at the spot of your death, and you must fight you way back to reclaim them.  If you die on the way, they're lost forever.  This is the reason people find Dark Souls so punishing.  Battle, run, or sneak past the enemies to reach a bonfire, which acts as a checkpoint.  Continue until you find the next checkpoint.  It's pretty simple.  At any checkpoint, you can return to a hub and spend your souls on new equipment or use them to level up.

Characters
There are no strict character class limitations in Dark Souls.  Your character is just a combination of attributes and your equipment. There are 9 Attributes that you can increase, to adjust the performance of your character.
Vigor increases your Health.  More vigor means a longer health bar.
Attunement allows you to cast more types of spells.
Endurance increases your Stamina, so you can attack, block, and evade more times without pausing to recover.
Vitality increases the total weight of what your character can carry.  If your gear is less than 70% of your MAX, you can evade with a fast dive roll.  If your gear is more than 70% of your MAX, you can evade, but you'll flop to the ground and get up slowly.
Strength allows you do wield heavy weapons, and in some cases deal bonus damage.
Dexterity allows you to wield finesse weapons, and in some cases, deal bonus damage.
Intelligence allows you to cast more powerful magic spells.  (Mage spells like Fireball)
Faith allows you to cast more powerful miracles.  (Cleric Spells like Heal)
Luck increases your chance to find helpful items in the world.

How you level up these attributes will greatly affect how your character plays.  Dark Souls is a precision game and when you level up your character, you make a slight improvement to one of these.  You want these slight improvements to empower you.

For example:  If you are fighting a boss, and he kills you in 2 hits, increasing your Vigor a few times will allow you to survive 2 hits and have some health left over so you can heal and keep the battle going.

OR:  If you find a HUGE SWORD and its Strength requirement is 20, and yours is only 18, you cannot use the sword effectively one handed.  You can opt for a two-handed grip on the sword and you'll be able to attack with it, but you won't be able to use a shield for blocking and parrying.  If you gained 2 more points of Strength, you'll be able to swing the HUGE SWORD one handed and deal more damage while also using a shield.

OR:  If you can only swing your sword 4 times without running out of Stamina, increasing your Endurance will enable you to swing it 5, 6, 7, or even 8 times.

OR:  If you want to wear heavy armor for more protection, and perform diving rolls, increasing your Vitality will allow you to wear heavier armor for more protection, and still evade.

How you level up your character is completely up to you.  Remember, this is a precision / finesse / skill game, so all of these slight adjustments affect the performance of your character.  By leveling up strategically, you'll become much more powerful.

Your character has 3 gameplay stats.  Health, Focus, and Stamina.  When your Health reaches 0, you die.  You need Focus to cast spells or perform special weapon attacks.  You need Stamina, to swing your sword, evade, or block / parry incoming attacks with a shield.  Your stamina recovers on its own.  Your Health and Magic are replenished when you rest at a Bonfire or drink an Estus Flask (potion.)  Beware, there is a drinking animation, and you can only walk while drinking.  So, in a battle, you need to find a break in the action, or a safe spot, to safely drink your potion.  The last thing you want to do is get hit and lose half of your health while you're drinking a healing potion.  That sorta defeats the purpose.

The new addition to Dark Souls 3 is that you have two kinds of Estus Flasks.  One for Magic and one for Focus.  If you have 10 flasks, you can decide how many of each you want to carry by visiting the Blacksmith.  Do you want 5 of each or 8 Health and 2 Focus?  Its up to you.

Dark Souls 3 also offers a ton of options when it comes to weapons and armor.  Fight with two daggers, two swords, two hammers, a massive two handed sword, a massive hammer, a sword and a shield, a spear, two spears, a bow, a magic talisman, a shield is good for bashing, or a magic wand.  The armor ranges from light, to medium, to heavy, and you can mix an match any of the pieces.  If you find a great breastplate, but it is heavy, you can compensate for the weight by wearing a light helmet, gloves, and leg armor.  How you equip your character is completely up to you.

The Weapons in Dark Souls 3 also have special moves.  Hold down the L2 or R2 buttons to trigger them.  This makes PVP combat much more interesting.

Combat
Is difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes fun and engaging.  Watch for the angles, timing, and distance of the attacks of your enemies and you'll see how to block, evade, and counter.  You'll see when the enemy is wide open for a counterattack.  When that hulking brute smashes his club into the ground, you'll notice he's stuck that way for 1.5 seconds, while he picks it back up.  This is a great opportunity to get in a few hits, then get back on defense.

The enemy types, your weapons, your stats, the environment, and damage types all factor into your strategy.  If you are fighting two enemies with spears in a narrow hallway, they'll jab you to death because you won't be able to roll to the side or behind them.  In this case, you'd want to lure them into a wide area, and hopefully split them up so you only have to fight one at a time.  Maybe you'll see that an enemy is very vulnerable to fire damage, and you have a fire spell, an item to enchant your blade with fire, or throw a small firebomb at it.  Damage types also affect the outcome of a battle.

Boss battles are huge and function the same way.  If you are playing online, you may summon other players to join your game and help you fight bosses and enemies.  This makes a nearly impossible boss very manageable.

The enemies in Dark Souls 3 all seem pretty fair.  After a few encounters you can figure out their weaknesses very quickly.  I wouldnt say any of them are cheap.  However, Dark Souls 3 still has the same camera / lockon issues as the previous games in the series.  At times, it will be hard to stay focused on enemies, especially if they are fast and agile.  Your target lock may skip to another, which may cause confusion.  This has been a problem with the series.

The bosses in Dark Souls 3 range from easy to almost impossible.  The first few bosses in the game are pretty straightforward and the last two will offer insane amounts of challenge if you are playing solo.  For any boss, you can summon other players to help you fight.  A 2 on 1 or 3 on 1 boss battle turns an incredibly tough fight into a fairly easy one if you aren't reckless.

Areas
The level designs are all paths to a boss, with some branches.  The basic level works like this.  Proceed down the path, kill a bunch of guys, and reach a new checkpoint.  Continue through the level, kill enemies, and unlock a shortcut from the last checkpoint you visited.  So if you are battling your way to the top of a tower, at the halfway point, you may find an elevator that allows you to bypass the first half of the tower... or in some cases, take you to the boss fight at the end.

Atmosphere
As with all Souls games, the atmosphere is dark, lonely, and creepy.  There are so many different types of enemies, each posing their own type of challenge.  The music ranges from atmospheric to epic.  Atmospheric while you're exploring and epic during the boss fights.  You are venturing through a desolate world, so don't expect to find any happy towns full of helpful NPC's.  This is a lonely quest through a harsh environment with peaks and valleys.

Multiplayer
You can play cooperatively or player vs player.  Team up with other players to battle through tough spots in the game, or duel other players in PVP.  Killing another player requires you to manage your health and stamina bars, as you look for weaknesses in their defense, health, or stamina.  If an enemy swings a heavy sword a few times and misses, you know his stamina is low and you can charge in and start attacking.  If he tries to block, youll deplete his stamina, his shield arm will drop, and youll get in some hits.  To survive in Dark Souls 3, youll need to exploit every advantage of your enemies.

Maturity
M for blood and fantasy violence.  This game could easily be Teen rated, the same way Halo could be Teen rated.  There is no swearing, sex, nudity... just fantasy violence and some blood.  And you can even turn off the blood in the options menu.  I'm not saying you need to buy this game for your 8 year old.  But this game would be fine for teens.

Overall
It plays like the other Souls games, and if you want a challenge (and the right to renew your hardcore gaming license) then you play this.  Graphically, it is far better than DS 1 and DS 2.  Some of the enemies are a bit similar to the enemies in DS2 and Bloodborne, but they're different enough to make you think about defeating them.  If you want to overcome challenges and feel like a champ but a lonely uncelebrated champ in a desolate world then this game is for you.","When You Die, You Learn Something New!",1461542400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The developers did a great job turning a game from a familiar genre into an entertaining game by giving the game likable characters and a great story. Developing melee skills is extremely entertaining because all the games in the genre concentrate on gunplay so much. The melee is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, which allows for parries and counters. Going into a melee situation without a plan will cost you your life in many cases. As for the gunplay, it somehow feels more natural than GTA or Saints Row due to a cover system. The only complaint that I have is that the game lacks a little polish in the graphics. Especially in the background graphics that appear to be pasted and have no dimensional feel to them. But does it really matter? No. The voice acting is great as well.

5.0,False,"07 8, 2014",A1AD4BOPD0RJIF,B0009Z3KAI,scifihorrorgamer,"I bought this game because it was $5 at my game store. I had heard that the 3D Castlevania games suck so I was a bit worried. I checked the amazon ps2 ratings for the game when I got home and was even more worried. Many people did not like the game or said it was mediocre. I put the game in my Xbox and then started it. I noticed the graphics were fair, but not that impressive. The controls felt pretty nice as well. I had no problems with the camera either, other than the inverted turning controls. I went into the Castle and noticed it was set up like a corridor, with walls shielding the left and right. At first I was afraid the game would be linear. Linear games are good, but they tend to be short and I was looking for a more open game. I got to a point where I saw two paths. I took the path on the right and it only went to a couple of rooms and then to a locked door. I went the other direction and it was a straight foreward path. I then played about 20 minutes and got to the end of the path on the left. I found an item in a treasure chest that I brought back to the locked door on the right path. I used the item and the door opened, accessing me to a new area. I actually liked backtracking because it gave the game a metroidvania feel. I continued down the new area and found a point where there were 3 paths to choose from. I chose one path and noticed it wouldn't end. I thought there was one main path and that the other rooms lead to small rooms with a special item or something. I backtracked to the point where the 3 paths were and tried another path. This path wouldn't end either. I then tried the third path and that wouldn't end. I took the 2nd path and ventured forward. The path just kept going and going. I got to a point where there were 2 paths to choose from when I was on the third path for a while. I kept having to choose between multiple paths, where to go. The one path I took lead me to other paths and eventually a boss fight. I haven't even explored the first and third path from beginning of the game that much. That means those three paths would all keep going and breaking up into new paths and then break up into even more paths. After I took the boss down that I got to from the 2nd path in thr beginning, yet another passage opened up. I finally realized what the game is at this point. It's a 3D metroidvania game! I always thought that metroidvania was only for 2D games, but this game pulls it off and does a damn good job of it too. This game is metroidvania to the core. It has lots of paths and routes to take and it has lots of backtracking to older areas, to access new areas or chests with an aquired item. For that reason, I am absolutely loving this game. This game and Metroid Prime prove that metroidvania works with 3D games too. It really is quite innovative. Other than those awesome aspects, the combat is hack and slash gameplay with simple button combos. It works well and combat is pretty fast. The level design is pretty much just paths with a skin over them, but it never really bothered me. At new areas, the skin would have a different them and it kept the game from looking boring or repetive. The enemies are a little repetive and are reused a bit too often, but in many areas there are new enemies to face. Overall the enemies are pretty varied and they all look awesome with their supernatural themes. The story so far is pretty good. It seems like a revenge story, but that's ok. The story is good enough to keep you interested and get you through the game. The music is fantastic and just very catchy. It changes enough that songs don't become repetitive. There are a pretty descent amount of songs overall and they all sound great. Combat is on the easy side, but that's perfectly fine with me because it means I can actually beat the game. (I have enough hard games that I can't beat). Save points are frequent and enemies go down pretty easily. The game is also an RPG, in that you level up and craft items. It also takes a note out of the Shin Megami Tensei games by giving you familiars to summon. Familiars are like the demons in SMT games, or like Pokemon, There are many demons to collect, use, and level up. They are a nice addition to the game because they help you out immensely and add variety to the gameplay. The voice acting in this game is, like everything else, very good. The characters are believable and pretty engaging. Hectar himself is a good character and he is pretty likeable. The only small flaw I had with this game was it's plain level design. There is no platforming at all here. It's just paths on level ground. This really isn't a big deal though, because the game is a lot of fun, and exploring is fun and rewarding. The other small issue I have is the story is a little underwhelming, but it's still good enough to keep me going and keep my interest. The game will take about 15-18 hours to complete, according to www.howlongtobeat.com so it's not that long, but it's not ridiculously short like some other games are. I would have liked the game to be 20-40 hours, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall I bought this game not expecting much and I was pleasantly surprised by it. It just absolutely surpassed my expectations and blew me away. It's a fantastic 3D metroidvania Castlevania, and as a fan of Symphony of the Night for ps1 and Portrait of Ruin for DS, I can say that this a great Castlevania game, even though it's 3D. 3D Castlevania does work, and this game shows that in spades. It's dirt cheap right now and severely underrated and overhated for no reason. It's far better than Castlevania 64 and definitely one of the, if not the best, 3D Castlevania game ever made. I'd even say it's one of my favorite Castlevania games of all time, out of all the games, This game is a gem and it should not be passed up. Get this and also get Castlevania Legacy of Darkness on n64. Nobody bought it because Castlevania 64 was a dissapointment. Legacy of Darkness, it's sequel, is actually excellent and much better than Castlevania 64. It too is one of the best 3D Castlevania games. Sadly that game sold poorly, and is now in demand because people started realizing how great the game is. It now goes for $35. Curse of Darkness is only $5 so get it while it's cheap. I just can't believe how great this game turned out to be.",3D metroidvania-style Castlevania...and it works!,1404777600,,,

You basically wake up on a train and find yourself in a train station...OK, so not much was put into an opening movie or storyline, but thankfully it gets much better from there. There are subsequent areas where things are somewhat explained incrementally, but you'll probably be so into the quality of the gameplay by then that it just starts filling things in a little better. There was obviously a great deal of planning that went into HL2 and BRAVO to Valve for following that up with great execution of the plan. There were a couple of places I did notice a frame rate drop, but they were quickly played through. In fact, there is so much going on in this game at times that it's a pure wonder that there aren't a couple of dozen places with frame rate problems.

Thankfully this game was produced in a epic-type format. You go on a true journey from that original train station through some pretty creative scenes that require a combination of quick reflexes, puzzle-solving and resourcefulness to get you safely through plenty of good old fashioned shoot-them-before-they-shoot-you adrenaline pumping confrontations. Quick Save often and at any time you please. Then there's the almost guilt-inducing selection of weapons you collect when progressing through levels and plenty of times where you'll nearly jump out of your seat or nearly paralyzed with fear (I can still hear that attack gunship's gun batteries charging up before firing lethal rounds...Ouch!)

HL2 is just a GREAT game...Even if you never really liked FPS games. There are times that will be frustratingly difficult, but when you finally pull it off and clear the level it produces a sublime sense of satisfaction rarely found anywhere else on Earth. The graphics are really top-notch along with the sound effects. The other 2 HL2 ""Episodes"" extend the story, although the game titles are unnecessarily confusing:

Half-Life 2; Half-Life 2: Episode One; Half-Life 2: Episode Two. Those are 3 separate games, so why not HL2, HL3: Episode One and HL3: Episode Two?!?! Or even HL2, HL2: Episode Two and HL2: Episode Three?

Portal is a great diversion, although it's over just about the time you start really excelling at the game. Can't comment on Team Fortress 2, haven't played it. All told, we got a great deal of fun out of 4 of the games in The Orange Box and I've bought more expensive games that have only one game (like most) and regretted the purchase because of poor gameplay and zero fun factor.

The gameplay was simply no match for NBA Live's gameplay, which was downright horrible.  Well, just when I though 2K Sports couldn't make a better basketball game than last years, this game came out.  One of the big problems with NBA 2K7 was the graphics.  A lot of the players didn't really resemble their real life counterpart.  Well, that is no longer the case.  2K8's graphics are the best I've seen yet, and all the players look so realistic that you actually believe that you're out there with them sweating on the court.

Of course, graphics aren't everything, right?  Well, 2K8 has even better gameplay than last years.  The shot stick still rocks the house, but there are also a lot of new additions to each game you play.  After each game, you can watch the top three plays of the game.  But that's not the coolest part.  After each game, you can watch a highlight real of any player during the game.  If you're playing as Kobe Bryant and you score 50 points against your opponent, then after the game you can watch each amazing play made by Kobe during the game.  Sweet, right?

Well, this game also has a very fun and very realistic Sprite Slam Dunk Contest.  This should keep you busy for hours, and it isn't even a part of the main game. If you're not good a dunking, there is a dunk school that can teach you how to emulate LeBron on his jams.  There is also a really cool 3-Point Shootout.

So, if you're debating whether or not you should go with the hoops king 2K8, or try NBA Live 08, then I would HIGHLY suggest you get 2K8.  Even though Live 08 is greatly improved upon, it still has a ways to go to catch up with 2K Sports and their basketball genius.",NBA 2K8 Takes It Up A Notch!,1191283200,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The NPC's are great getting to know and complex, but what it comes down to me is story, and this game has that.  The individual story of your PC that you shape and are shaped by, the Hawke family's story, your compatriots and the world, all ingeniously interwoven.  The world is full of grays and there is no Ideal.  The morality choices are philosophical and the outcome of your choices are unclear.  At times I stared at the screen knowing what my companion wanted and believed in with all of them, and I believed was wrong.  They did not forgive me or come around.  No side is the correct side.  No side is the right side.  I played as a mage and was stressed; I didn't want to be the center of this attention and I didn't want to be the one who fixed or decided everything, because none of it was obvious.  I would love to say more, but I don't want to give anything away and I'm still processing.

There are problems- reused environments and maps; they're beautiful, but exactly the same.  The plot is not very plotty- your character does not have a clear goal, so it does feel unfocused, but to me, that is the life of this character- your champion did not sign up to be champion.

The combat is exciting, the mage throws very cools spells, the rogue flips around, I have loved playing both.  The skills for the classes are very cool and allow you to be a mage who excels in healing or damage or elements or a little of each, for example, warriors and rogues also have many possibilities.  Ally AI is good and you have much more tactical control if you want it.  You feel powerful, battles are fun, the story is complex and compelling, the sound is top notch (everything from spell effects to voice acting), and visually it is beautiful.  This is a rare game.  There are aspects of it that are not traditional.  I've heard the complaints, but think that they are based on expectations on what this kind of game usually is and are initially uncomfortable.

It's beautiful, and the driving is great. Oh sure, sometimes the computer cars remind you most cruelly that you're playing a game. And it has a few features that make you just go ""why?"" I assume the developers had time to kill while Sony was getting all of those manufacturer deals worked out. But it's still quite good.

It's a driving simulator. It's not a ""street racing"" game, it's not Burnout Revenge. It's about driving cars and, basically, nothing else. The computer-driven cars look good and often behave like real cars, but they're mostly there as a measuring stick for your own performance and to give you something to pass. Racing is like darts or golf: other people are there, but you're really playing against your own best score.

Most annoying thing in the game: getting bumped off the road at 200mph by computer cars that can't be wrecked.

Stupidest game decision: oil changes. I have to manually change the oil? Lame! I already get enough of that in real life. And why am I spending $500 for an oil change? Is my head mechanic doing it?

Best new thing: online challenges. I spent two weeks trying to get a better lap time on one time trial, and ended up posting a score that was not quite 20000th. Hey, I never claimed to be a great driver. :) The challenges time out, which makes them more exciting somehow.

5.0,False,"07 7, 2010",ARNEUO7BF3J55,B002BSA388,David Swan,"Mario Galaxy 2 is currently the third highest rated game ever on gamerankings falling directly behind the first Mario Galaxy. Gamerankings uses an aggregate score drawn from dozens of professional online and print reviews across the industry. It's pretty staggering to think that after over three decades of video games Mario Galaxy 2 is the third best reviewed game OF ALL TIME. This is most definitely, without a doubt, a five star game but is it perfection as IGN would imply with its extraordinarily rare bestowing of a 10 out of 10 score? In fact it's not perfect and I will focus on the few areas where it falls short of expectations.

Despite its stellar reviews Mario Galaxy 2 is not my all time favorite Mario game, that would be the hugely underrated Mario Sunshine and it wouldn't even be my favorite Mario game of the past year, which would be New Super Mario for the Wii. Mario Sunshine was groundbreaking in its use of water physics and even the underwhelming Luigi's Haunted House was pretty amazing in it's handling of light and fabric physics. At the time I was pretty excited that Nintendo was pushing the envelope with its simulation of real world physics but since then not much has happened. New Super Mario did some pretty amazing stuff for a side scrolling platformer but about the only thing Mario Galaxy explores are the physics of gravity but in this case they're purposely all wrong. Even if I were to accept that these tiny planetoids possessed super dense gravity causing them to be somewhat equal to the gravity of the mushroom kingdom how would the gravity of a cylinder cause Mario to revolve around it like a satellite. The water physics in the game haven't really advanced since Mario Sunshine and the use of light is very sparing. All in all Mario Galaxy 2 is pretty much a rehash of the first Mario Galaxy and explores few new areas and no, I don't really consider any of the new Mario suits revolutionary.

The first 3D platformer that really blew me away when it came to level design (besides that granddaddy of them all, Mario 64) was Banjo-Kazooie. I can still distinctly remember many of the levels twelve years later. Never before had I experienced a game where I truly felt the depth of vision and when I climbed a tall structure and look down it was exhilarating. Mario Sunshine took this concept of height and depth and added in beauty. Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 continue to add polish to the series but particularly with number 2 the level design just weren't very memorable. Sometimes it isn't the amount of polish that makes a level memorable, sometimes it's the intangibles. Mario Galaxy 2 contains around 50 levels and most have two or three shines to collect which for me meant I could blow through most levels very quickly. In fact I plowed through the game much faster than any Mario game I've played in the last decade or so and having completed the game less than a week ago none of the levels stand out in my brain. Mario Sunshine burned them into my brain because of repeated playing and because many were very creatively designed. My point is it felt like Mario Galaxy 2 chose quantity over quality. I would have preferred 10 spectacular, mind blowing levels over 50 very good levels errr... galaxies.

I would never want to imply that Mario Galaxy 2 is anything less than a spectacular game that should be in every Wii owners' library. It is a magnificent platformer and a proud addition to the Mario franchise. It just doesn't move the franchise forward more than an inch beyond the first Mario Galaxy. One thing I would love to see is a real high quality game like Mario Galaxy on the 3DS because it's always a little difficult moving precisely in a 3 dimension world when you have no real depth perception particularly when stomping on enemies. True 3D would really be the end all be all of Mario games.

I remember nights where I would stay up all night crawling thru a dungeon in 7 with the hairs on the back of my neck standing up because the game was so  thrilling to play.  Sure the graphics of 6 are outdated, but anyone who has  played thru it entirely knows the gameplay more than makes up for it.  These games had a very strange atmosphere which made you wonder what would  happen next.  Another great thing about them is you can move/steal any  object and kill ANYONE at any time which adds up to months more  entertainment besides just the great story.  Ultima 8 however was a  horrible action type game made by EA and not the original director.  But 6  and 7 are a fantastic deal at this price, especially for collector like  myself.  The only gripe I have is that Ultima7 was not redesigned for  windows and you may have some problems getting the mouse/sound to work.  It  would have been easy for them to redesign it for Win98 and would have saved  alot of people headaches.  Still this is a fantastic piece of gaming  history.

I played it just to try it and I wound up getting so addicted I had to buy it for my N64.  I would stay up til all hours playing it.  It's rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you can't help but say ""okay I'ma try one more time then I'm turning it off"" and still be playing a couple of hours later.
The Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and wouldn't do things right as far as the puzzles went.  I loved the Forest Temple as a kid.  The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do.  The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach, hitting switches, and killing enemies.  The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them.  lol
I don't remember much else about the game since it's been a while since I had time to play it.  I do know it took me quite a while before I managed to get some things such as all the Poes and Golden Skulltulas but no matter how many times I play this game it doesn't lose its appeal.

It's the second easiest game of the three Zelda's I've played.

* a challenge? In Fifa 06 the AI is much improved, and you will need to utilize strategy in order win. Basically, this isn't a game that you will simply pick up right away and beat opponents 4-0. It is competitive but not so challenging that you will throw down the controller in frustration. Obviously, the more you play, the better you will become, and you can always change AI levels to suit your taste.

* fun? Whether it is a single match or head-to-head play with a friend, Fifa 06 will have you cheering outloud when you score the go ahead goal. It really doesn't matter if you are a fan of soccer or not, you will enjoy this game.

* replay value? There are plenty of game modes for your entertainment: manager, dynasty, tournament, practice, etc. Plus, contrary to another review I saw, there are many, many teams to choose from (international and regional leagues).

* graphics and gameplay? The graphics of Fifa 06 really pull everything together quite nicely, and the realistic touch controls allow for smooth gameplay. Add in the stadiums, the crowd, and the announcers, and you have a real winner in Fifa 06.

The only thing is that I can't seem to skip the the cut scenes, but I do enjoy the story line. I think it's awesome I can summon pets, with Yuna. I enjoy the fighting style of the game. I like that I can select from commands, to cast spells. Also, the fights seem to last for a minute, or 2, which makes it more fun. But the boss battles can last awhile, but I like it that way.

The story line is very deep and long. If a person were to record all the Cut scenes, it make a nice long movie.

I can ride chickens, play blitz ball. Though I think blitz ball is ok. I would rather fight in battle.

The graphics. I have to agree look great for the ps 2, for this game.

The camera is full view, which I also enjoy, as I am a fan of full view camera angles in video games.

I like I can play girl and guy characters. There is even an animal character who fights in battle as Yuna's guardian. I think Lulu is cool to, as she cast black mage spells. I think there are 6 characters to chose from in battles. I'm, trying to remember, but I think it's awesome, that I can select from different characters to fight with.

The screen will break, before a monster battle. I don't mind though, just stating it's on this game, like it was in FF X-2.

The puzzles are a little confusing for me, but I can use game cheats. This is mostly a fight game, but there are some puzzles to figure out. I will soon be going to the next sphere puzzle room. I looked on youtube.

I see this game has very good reviews and I can see why. I also bought the game for my kid for Christmas as she is a fan of RP games, like me. I really think she will enjoy this game, as I did. Very fun, very entertaining game.

5.0,False,"11 25, 2004",A29Z8XYDD5UZF8,B0006B0O9U,comebackking1,"Many people dreamed of the day Mario would hit the Gamecube.  Along came Mario Sunshine but with some disappointment, it just didn't quite live up to the hype.  What could Mario possibly do to regain his place in our hearts?  How about a rerelease of the original, wildly popular Mario 64 (with MANY additions and improvements) on the new Nintendo DS!

The first thing you notice while setting out on your adventure is the vastly improved graphics.  Everything looks crisper, cleaner, and sharper than the original.  It is a beautiful game to explore.  If you enjoyed the original 64 bit adventure, then you will love this 96 bit masterpiece.

Mario lacks nothing in the sound department either.  New voiceovers and remixed music join the originals voices and tunes to create a very pleasant sounding experience.  Nothing sounded ""tinny"" here.  The virtual surround sound even allows you to hear when something is approaching from behind.  No problems here.

The issue on everyone's mind is in the control department.  Does it work?  The short answer is yes, with some practice.  Remember that the original used an analog stick for movement so some small compromises had to be made.  It can be controlled in 3 different ways.

1)You can use the control pad for movement.  It works fairly well.  Most of the trouble stems from the inability to be really precise with your movements.  You may find it hard to cross a narrow bridge or sneak by a sleeping enemy, but overall it's decent.

2)The second method is using the enclosed thumbpad and sliding it on the touchscreen for simulated analog control.  This is the most natural of the three.  You simply place the pad (or your bare thumb) anywhere on the screen.  That point becomes the ""neutral point"" so the further you slide your thumb away from it, the faster you will move.  You can reset the neutral point at anytime by simply lifting your thumb from the screen and setting it in a more comfortable spot.

3)The last way is to use the stylus for movement and either the ABX and Y buttons or the control pad (which functions the same as ABXY).  The advantage here is that you can move with either hand and jump, punch, etc. with the other.  It's pretty effective overall just like method #2; I just don't use it much.

Many addtions were made to the original.  The game now includes four playable characters (Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi) as well as 30 more stars than the original.  Also included are several minigames which are extraordinarily fun and are great to play when you have just a few minutes.

All in all this game is well worth the $30-$35.  It showcases many of the features and much of the potential that the DS possesses.  It is one game that no DS owner should be without, and it does a wonderful job bringing Mario back into the limelight (or sunshine as the case may be)!!!","After Sunshine, Mario truly gets his day in the sun!!!",1101340800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Yeah, it took a little while to get used to it, but it's still one of the best I've ever played: good story, great graphics, and awesome gameplay! Spider-Man was even funnier than ever and the villains were okay also( but my vote for best villains still goes to the original game ""Spider-Man"" for the PS1). There are a few villains returning from the other 2 games along with some new ones(although this game is technically a prequel to the PS1 games). Meaning, this is the first time Spider-Man meets the villains presented in this game. The old favorites Shocker and Scorpion have returned and the new ones are the Vulture and(ofcourse) the Green Goblin. The voice acting in this game was great and the levels were incredibly realistic and lifelike. One of the coolest (and hardest) levels in the game is when Spider-Man goes to Oscorp and fights their ultimate weapon: the Super Mech! This robot was beyond huge! It was at least twice the size of a Gundam mobile suit! And the fact that Spider-Man was able to beat it all by himself shows just how much of a badass Spider-Man really is!
This game also brings something new that didn't appear in the other games: aerial combat!

Ok, here's the review:

For the longest time, I've been using the Corsair K90 as my main keyboard. It was really nice, especially using the MX Red Switches (these have no feedback and instead just slide). I loved that keyboard, and everything it came with. But recently, during christmas, I was given about 100 dollars worth of gift cards. Seeing that the Black Widow was revamped, as they took the annoying shiny plastic off and changed the color to green (color doesn't matter, but the plastic was irritating) I decided to put down some money on this keyboard. I was surprised by how much I loved it. They MX Blue switches are really enjoyable to type on. The click, though annoying, is satisfying. And the color isn't really that intruding, and looks nice with the keyboard as well. It can get VERY bright, so be careful on how high you have the settings. Ok, now for Pros and Cons.

Pros:

Nice Shape
Great choice in Switches (MX Cherry Blue)
The layout is closer together than a few, but not too close. Very nice feel.
Textured keys
Matte Black finish
Looks nice
Unique lettering
5 macro keys
Color is nice
Has a USB port and two audio ports if you need them

Cons:

Would like individual media keys instead of FN keys
^ Replace the FN key with a windows Key
Have an On-The-Fly Macro writer
A wider range of colors would be nice
An included Wristguard would be nice

That's pretty much it. A really nice keyboard that is now my main keyboard. I will be primarily using this with my K90 as a backup because I like this a bit more. Honestly, if it wasn't for the MX Cherry Blue switches, the K90 would probably be my main. But they're just so satisfying to type on that I can't replace it atm.",Amazing Keyboard,1357430400,3,{'Style:': ' Ultimate'},

5.0,True,"02 21, 2015",A3UZNB0AGH4AMI,B00HM3QAWK,Audio,"Great little controller, great price (little operative word - it's significantly smaller than the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer, i.e. ""Original""/""Official"") first gen Genesis controller, which was known for being rather large).  At first I thought the D-pad was a bit mushy (just playing with it as I opened the package) but comparing it to an OEM Genesis controller it's eerily similar (a good thing).  A few seconds of working my thumb around it to ""prime"" it and it felt really good.  Further comparing it an OEM controller, while again the pad is rather small in comparison, D-pad and the buttons are about the same distance on both (though of course the original Genesis controller only had 3 buttons and not 6).

The only other real layout difference is the START key, which actually, I prefer here in the center and with the smaller controller feels natural.  The cord is similar to the OEM (big, thick, black - though not *quite* as thick) but it is much more flexible and gives a lot more (isn't as easy to ""kink"" up).  It's still rather stiff and certainly not braided or anything, but it is notably more flexible.  Pairing this with an extension cable also from Amazon I had ample cord and was able to comfortably set the controller down without worrying about folks tripping, etc.

Personally, I prefer the larger OEM controller, but for the price this is a great second controller to have around, for playing 2-Player or for a game that requires 6 buttons (Street Fighter, etc).  At some point when making a future purchase, I'm likely to pick up another one of these if I see a good price just to have around as a ""backup"" if ever needed.  This was my first non-OEM controller purchase, and am impressed enough to check out some of the other Hyperkin controllers for other systems as need comes up.

Players take on the role of members of the Thors Military Academy in the Erobonian Empire, a place where social status is everything. The turn-based combat system is similar to what was seen in Trails in the Sky, where every character's actions appear on a list on the left side of the screen. You move your characters around the environment and take advantage of positioning and special attacks to battle multiple enemies at once or avoid incoming assaults. An important component of the combat system is your ability to manipulate the turn order.

I have received my game a little in advance, so I have had time to experiment with many of the games mechanics, and so far I have been impressed with the amount of strategy involved. Moving before enemies has a number of benefits; if you're smart about manipulating your turn order, you can go multiple times in a row. Additionally, there are special bonuses that you can get only if you attack on a certain turn. If you manipulate the turn order so your turn falls on a bonus square, you can turn quite a profit. This is made easier by S-Breaks, which you can use to force your character to take a turn. This is great for emergency healing or for grabbing a valuable bonus before an enemy can use it.

New to the franchise is the Link system, which sounds like Social Links in the Persona franchise. As you play, you build up friendships with the other members of the cast. As their friendships develop, they gain access to special techniques and abilities that they can use. Friendships can be used to assist each other's attacks, and higher levels of Link abilities grant more powerful bonuses, so building friendships can improve difficult battles. Trails of Cold Steel introduces some interesting changes to the core mechanics, such as the way your Orbment is handled. Rather than the semi-complex equipment upgrading from Trails in the Sky, quartz are now skills which can be equipped. You also have the ability to instantly swap characters in battle, so you're not stuck with a set party.

While the previous games were done in a sort of overhead view, Trails of Cold Steel is the first fully 3-D game in the franchise. This adds some interesting complexity to dungeon crawling because there are more ways to move around. Enemies appear on the battle map, and you now have the ability to attack them, Persona-style, to get bonuses. If you hit an enemy, you can stun them and run past or go into the fight with a turn advantage. Legend of Heroes also supports cross-play, so you can swap back and forth between the PS3 and Vita.

Final Verdict:

The new 3-D graphics look quite good, which really makes the game enjoyable to play, just don't go into the game expecting a ""Next Gen Experience"" after all, this is also a PlayStation Vita game. The Vita can still deliver great games, and the system is actually more powerful than the PS2, Just think of it as being a game from one of the good old PS2 days, while very fun to play, it is still inferior mechanically and graphically when being compared to triple A games we are seeing these days. However, a cool combat system, an interesting concept, multiple difficulty settings and some fantastic music come together to make it easily one of best treats for PS3 owners this year, as we reach the end of any new and creative games the PS3 may be receiving. I would highly recommend this game to fans of the JRPG genre, and its pure enjoyment to see one last strategy game added to an already robust PS3 library.

I would also like to add that I ordered the limited edition, and I must say that it is worth the extra $10, and I was shocked with the quality that I received. This collection is a pure embarrassment when compared to what big game companies are providing. It comes is a very nice case that is around 2 inches thick, and inside the box is an additional box that can be used for a future sequel, a pin, and a jumbo size art book that contains 141 pages. The book itself is in full color and is in superb quality waxed paper and its easily worth $25. The game is also very nice, and it comes with a reversible cover that is in full color, as well as a thick instruction manual that is also in full color. They simply don't make stuff like this anymore, and when they do, its far and few between and high dollar is normally changed for it.",A Nice Treat For Strategy Fans!,1450742400,33,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game is definitly an easy achievement game, a lot easier than 07, 08 or 09. If you're interested in a quick 1000, this could definitly be up your alley.

I will assume most people looking at this review have played at least one of the last 3 year's games (07,08 and 09). Having played all of them, I can easily say this is the best in the series. They made a ton of tiny changes, that make the game more realistic (More reversal animations, leap-frogging or ducking a running opponent, red marks on your chest/back after taking a Ric Flair-patented chop).

What's better this year in comparion to '09? Well pretty much everything. There's nothing '09 had '10 doesn't that makes a difference. The gameplay is almost identical, yes so much better with the addition of the tapping out system, the flipping bodys over. The only thing I miss about '09 was the two-button reversal. ('09 had a reversal system where LT was pushed to reverse strikes, and RT to reverse Grapples. Now pressing RT and timing it correctly will reverse both).

Create a superstar is SO MUCH BETTER. Looking online to see creations that were up, I saw ""The Flash"" from DC Comics fame, and it looked identical. Suicide from TNA was also found, and again that was almost identical to the real life version. I know I'll be having fun with this feature, months down the line. The loading times are almost gone entirely too.

Road to Wrestlemania bothered me a bit. They basically took old storylines, and added new twists, and remade the cast. For example, Edge's RTWM is a re-hash of the ""La Familia"" storyline that took place last year, however instead of it being Vicky Guerrero, it was WWE Diva Maria. The stories aren't identical, there are new changes, and new twists, but I already saw this storyline. I wanted something ENTIRELY brand new. There was a lot of ""Holy crap"" and ""LMAO"" moments. For anyone who doesn't mind playing through old storylines with new twists this isn't a problem. The stories aren't half-bad at least.

The soundtrack to the game has most of the WWE superstars tracks, but it does have a few songs that were very good. For a true WWE fan the soundtrack is perfect.

The videos in the game, like the opening cutscene to anybody's RTWM is crystal clear. Amazing quality, as are the entrace videos. These literally blew me away.

Scramble matches, intergender tag matches, Divas can now play pretty much every match type, interfereces were some nice new additions as well. I was surprised and happy to see unlockables in the game such as THE ROCK, and TRISH STRATUS. However dissapointed with pointless characters like the Red and Green dummies.

Lastly, the biggest mode in the game. What most were waiting for. The addition of Create-a-storyline. I do not believe this is as User-friendly as they wanted it to be, but once you start learning what to do, this will be the most used feature in my opinion. Not as many choices concerning promos, but for a first year attempt this was amazing. Hardcore WWE fans will go nuts over this. Now that I've maxed it out in achievements, I will be spending my time making stories, and putting them on youtube, in between matches with my other WWE-crazed fans.

Unfortunately, I can't describe more without spoiling, but as you will progress through the game you will learn some shocking facts about this main character and story will introduce you to some mind-blowing surprises that you will not see coming.

GREAT OPENWORLD WILD WEST GAMEPLAY: After the story, this is the second most appealing feature of the game. You are free to roam in relatively huge open world and do variety of activities, which include but are not limited to shooting bandits and thieves, gambling, playing various games, catching and taming horses, hunting and ranching. Words are simply not enough to describe these gameplay or the joy will get from it. Play it to experience it.

PLENTY OF MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS: The story of this game is divided into missions. You will be traveling from one point on the world map to another to get these missions like GTA games and doing a huge variety of things (see above section). Completing each mission will unlock new missions. In addition to main missions, you will have plenty of side missions. To me both doing missions and side missions was very rewarding as completing them would unlock more of the fascinating story or humorous events.

GREAT IN GAME GRAPHICS, ANIMATION AND ART: This game looks wild west looks gorgeous. I am so amazed contrary to taking place in big open world, everything you see and experience feels so real. From creation of different land structures to plants, trees, animal and people, everything gives you the feeling that you are in actual wild west. Gorgeous simply gorgeous!

CINEMATIC CUTSCENES: Cutscenes are so nicely designed in this game that sometimes you forget you are playing a game and it simply feels like a movie. Part of that is due to the solid voice acting and part is due to detail in facial expressions of different characters. There are a lot of cutscenes, but most are short and well placed between the missions.

GREAT LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY: As stated above, I am 30+ hr into the game. I have finished the main story, but there are still many side missions and miscellaneous activity to finish. These days when most games are 6-10 hr long, having games like this makes my day (or month to be precise).
ONLINE GAMEPLAY: Not a huge fan of online gameplay anymore, but to those who care, it is available in this game and from little I have played, it feels quite addicting. Please refer to other reviews, as I am not a big fan of this.

DOWNLOADABE CONTENTS: While it is not free, to those who care you can download few DLCs off online. To me, the most interesting one seems the undead nightmare.

*************CONS.*****************

WATER=INSTANT DEATH: Hate it, simply hate it. I can understand if you say the main character can't swim, but then create invisible walls where you have bodies of water. What will happen is you will go near a body of water because it will have a chest there and before you know it you move your analogue stick in slightly wrong direction, fall into the water and die. So stupid!

MINOR GLITCHES: Hate to point it out, but there are minor glitches in the game. There are places you will get stuck or fall. But don't worry, it is nowhere near as bad as Fallout 3.

*************CONCLUSION***********

I give this game 9/10. Some of you may ask why give it such a high score after describing such cons. But the fact is this game has faults because the developers have been daring and tried to create something unique and big. If it can please me (a non GTA and not Wild West genre fan) then I would say it is a must buy for those who love either GTA or Wild West genre.",GTA in Wild West,1297641600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Composite video looked like garbage so I needed something.  This outputs 480i resolution nicely, sorry I can't say anything about 1080 or even 720, but I lack anything that even outputs that.
From what I have seen, these cables work with the PS3 as well, but at that point you should probably be using an HDMI connection anyway.  For the low price, I can't argue.

The creativity, imagination, and just fun game play reminds me back to the old Mario and Sonic games where games always seemed original and innovative at the time.  Today, most games emphasize on creating games that look like the real world, while it's impressive, it just doesn't have the uniqueness of an imaginary world.  It's great how the player interacts with the world to have a customized feel.  One part of the game asks you to draw a snow flake.  Then the rest of the stage it snows with the snow flake you drew.

I loved Little Big Planet and didn't expect much from this game when I saw trailers, but this game exceeded my expectations and I prefer it over LBP.

5.0,False,"03 28, 2015",A1PSBR3JRZ9VO0,B00RWBHNYG,Vdub,"These thumbstick grips are an excellent addition to your bin of Xbox accessories if you game a lot.

I tried these along with the ""sniper"" ones that extend the thumbsticks. Both fit perfectly and stay in place during use while protecting your actual thumbsticks from wear-and-tear. The difference is just the height. These ""combat"" ones are more for the protective aspect since they don't really change your playstyle. The other ones extend the stick to give you more accurate control over subtle scope aiming to make getting those headshots easier.

Both sets are great, though I will probably use the sniper ones more (on the right stick at least). I would prefer if the design more closely matched the original Xbox One thumbstick design, but it's still very good and the rubber gives you a very solid grip. The only minor complaint I would have is how they are some serious dust magnets (see picture). That doesn't affect their usability or durability in any way though, so not a big deal.

They were a little tricky to get on since the openings on the bottom are so small. It feels like you are going to damage them as you force them onto the sticks, but since they're just rubber, you don't really need to worry about it. Once they're on, all is good. Taking them off is definitely much easier.

Overall, I could definitely recommend these thumbstick grips to any serious Xbox One gamer.

There are a lot of MMO games out there and most are vanilla at best. I honestly didn't expect to like this game but with my PS4 gathering dust I took a shot and I'm hooked. The game has a great community, great story, cut scenes and unique quests are bountiful. The console controls are awkward at first but once you spend a few hours gaming you'll love it. There are dungeon finders to group you with other players, random events you can join in with others, and lots of loot to keep you changing out gear. Do yourself a favor and get to level 15 before making a judgment that way you can experience a good amount of the offerings.
